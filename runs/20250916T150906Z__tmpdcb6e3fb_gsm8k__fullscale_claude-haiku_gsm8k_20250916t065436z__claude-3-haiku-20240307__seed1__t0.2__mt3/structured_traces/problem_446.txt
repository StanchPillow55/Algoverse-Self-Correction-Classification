To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of eggs Rozanne has and then calculate the number of glasses of eggnog she can make. Finally, we can determine the number of trays she can put out.

Given information:
- Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs from cases and 2 loose eggs.
- Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
- Each glass needs 5 eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has.
4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs
2 loose eggs
Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make.
Number of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass
Number of glasses = 50 eggs / 5 eggs per glass = 10 glasses

Step 3: Calculate the number of trays Rozanne can put out.
Number of trays = Number of glasses / Glasses per tray
Number of trays = 10 glasses / 5 glasses per tray

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs in cases and 2 loose eggs in the cupboard.
- Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
- Each glass needs 5 eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has.
4 dozen eggs = 4 × 12 = 48 eggs
2 loose eggs
Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make.
Each glass needs 5 eggs
Number of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass
Number of glasses = 50 / 5 = 10 glasses

Step 3: Calculate the number of trays Rozanne can put out.
Each tray holds 5 glasses
Number of trays = Number of glasses / Glasses per tray
Number of trays = 10 / 5 = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of e
