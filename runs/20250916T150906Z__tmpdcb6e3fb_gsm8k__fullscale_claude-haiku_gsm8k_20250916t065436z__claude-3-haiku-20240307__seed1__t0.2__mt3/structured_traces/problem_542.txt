Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each
- Verna paid $20

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits.
Cost of apples = 3 × $1.50 = $4.50
Cost of oranges = 5 × $0.80 = $4.00
Cost of peaches = 6 × $0.75 = $4.50
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the change Verna received.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, the change Verna received is $7.00.
