To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the infection over time.

Given information:
- Initially, 10 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to find the number of people infected after 3 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of people infected on the first day.
Initial number of infected people = 10
Each infected person infects 6 others
Number of people infected on the first day = 10 × 6 = 60

Step 2: Calculate the number of people infected on the second day.
Number of people infected on the second day = (10 + 60) × 6 = 420

Step 3: Calculate the number of people infected on the third day.
Number of people infected on the third day = (10 + 60 + 420) × 6 = 2,940

Therefore, the total number of people infected after 3 days is:
10 (initial infected people) + 60 (infected on the first day) + 420

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Initially, 10 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to find the number of people infected after 3 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people infected on the first day.
Initially infected people: 10
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the first day = 10 + (10 × 6) = 10 + 60 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people infected on the second day.
Infected people on the first day: 70
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the second day = 70 + (70 × 6) = 70 + 420 = 490 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people infected on the third day.
Infected people on the second day: 490
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the third day = 490 + (490 × 6) = 490 +

Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Initially, 10 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to find the total number of people infected after 3 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people infected on the first day.
Initially infected people: 10
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the first day = 10 + (10 × 6) = 70

Step 2: Calculate the number of people infected on the second day.
Infected people on the first day: 70
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the second day = 70 + (70 × 6) = 490

Step 3: Calculate the number of people infected on the third day.
Infected people on the second day: 490
Each infected person infects 6 others
Total infected on the third day = 490 + (490 × 6) = 3,440

Therefore, the total number of people infected after three days is 3,440.
