To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock and then subtract the amount of line the caretaker already has.

Given information:
- The caretaker needs 3 feet of line for every foot of dock.
- There is currently 200 feet of dock.
- The caretaker has 6 feet of new line.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of line required for the 200 feet of dock.
Total line required = 3 feet of line per foot of dock × 200 feet of dock
Total line required = 3 × 200 = 600 feet of line

Step 2: Calculate the amount of line the caretaker needs to buy.
Line needed to buy = Total line required - Line already available
Line needed to buy = 600 feet - 6 feet = 594 feet

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.

Final answer: The caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.
