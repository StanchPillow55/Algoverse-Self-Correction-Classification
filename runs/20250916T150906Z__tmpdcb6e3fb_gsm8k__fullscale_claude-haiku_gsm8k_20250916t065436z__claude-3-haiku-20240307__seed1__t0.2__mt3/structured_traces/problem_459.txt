To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer is buying and then determine how many trips the farm truck needs to make to transport all the feed.

Given information:
- 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes
- 4 bags of 12-pound carrots
- 42 bales of 75-pound hay
- 20 sacks of 65-pound oats

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the sugar cubes.
Weight of sugar cubes = 2 boxes × 1 pound per box = 2 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the carrots.
Weight of carrots = 4 bags × 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the hay.
Weight of hay = 42 bales × 75 pounds per bale = 3,150 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the oats.
Weight of oats = 20 sacks × 65 pounds per sack = 1,300 pounds

Step 5: Calculate the total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sugar Cubes:
   * The farmer buys 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes
   * Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 x 1 pound = 2 pounds

2. Carrots:
   * The farmer buys 4 bags of 12-pound carrots
   * Total weight of carrots = 4 x 12 pounds = 48 pounds

3. Hay:
   * The farmer buys 42 bales of 75-pound hay
   * Total weight of hay = 42 x 75 pounds = 3,150 pounds

4. Oats:
   * The farmer buys 20 sacks of 65-pound oats
   * Total weight of oats = 20 x 65 pounds = 1,300 pounds

5. Total weight of all feed:
   * Total weight = Sugar Cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats
   * Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3,150
