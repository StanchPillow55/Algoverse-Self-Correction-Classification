Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.
- Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Becky's apples.
Total cost for Becky = (20 apples × $0.45 per apple) - $1 discount
Total cost for Becky = $9 - $1 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Kelly's apples.
Original cost for Kelly = 20 apples × $0.50 per apple = $10
Discount for Kelly = 10% of $10 = $1
Total cost for Kelly = $10 - $1 = $9

Step 3: Calculate the difference between what Kelly paid and what Becky paid.
Difference = Kelly's total cost - Becky's total cost
Difference = $9 - $8 = $1

Therefore, Kelly paid $1 more than
