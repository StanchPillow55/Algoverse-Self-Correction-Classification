To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
We need to find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

Step 2: Set up the equation.
Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially be x hectares.

After selling 3/5 of his land, he had 12.8 hectares left.
This means that 2/5 of the land (the remaining portion) is 12.8 hectares.

Step 3: Solve the equation.
2/5 of x = 12.8
x = 12.8 × 5/2
x = 32 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Final answer: Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

To find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to work backwards from the remaining land.

Step 1: Determine the amount of land Mr. Ruther sold.
Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount of land he sold is 3/5 of the total.
Let's call the total amount of land he had at first as "x" hectares.
Amount of land sold = 3/5 × x hectares

Step 2: Find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.
Amount of land left after the sale = 12.8 hectares
Amount of land sold + Amount of land left = Total amount of land
(3/5 × x) + 12.8 = x

Step 3: Solve for the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

To find the total amount of land he had at first, we need to work backwards from the remaining land.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of land sold.
Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, the remaining 2/5 of the land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's call the total amount of land he had at first as "x" hectares.
Then, 2/5 of x = 12.8 hectares
x = 12.8 ÷ (2/5)
x = 32 hectares

Step 2: Calculate the amount of land sold.
Amount of land sold = 3/5 of x
Amount of land sold = 3/5 × 32 = 19.2 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Final answer: Mr
