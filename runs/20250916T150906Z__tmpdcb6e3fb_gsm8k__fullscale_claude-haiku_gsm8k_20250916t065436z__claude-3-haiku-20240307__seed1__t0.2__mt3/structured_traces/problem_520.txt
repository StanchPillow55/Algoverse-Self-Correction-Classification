To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for all the items Martha wants to make for her three grandchildren.

Given information:
- Martha wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat.
- It takes 4 skeins of wool to make a scarf.
- It takes 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater.
- It takes 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for each item.
Hats: 3 grandchildren × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
Scarves: 3 grandchildren × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
Sweaters: 3 grandchildren × 12 skeins per sweater = 36

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha is knitting for 3 grandchildren (triplets)
- She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them

To calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to find the number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren.

1. Hat:
   - 2 skeins of wool per hat
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for hats = 2 x 3 = 6 skeins

2. Scarf:
   - 4 skeins of wool per scarf
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for scarves = 4 x 3 = 12 skeins

3. Sweater:
   - 12 skeins of wool per sweater
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for sweaters = 12 x 3 = 36 ske

  - 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater
  - 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens
  - 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks

To calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to multiply the number of items by the number of skeins required for each item, and then add them all up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of skeins needed for each item.
