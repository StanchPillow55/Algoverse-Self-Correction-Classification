Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John invited 20 people to a birthday party.
- Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
- John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
- A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed for the party.
Total number of hot dogs needed = Number of guests × Number of hot dogs per guest
Total number of hot dogs needed = 20 × 2 = 40 hot dogs

Step 2: Calculate the number of hot dogs John already has.
Number of hot dogs John already has = 4 hot dogs

Step 3: Calculate the number of hot dogs John needs to buy.
Number of hot dogs John needs to buy = Total number of hot dogs needed - Number of hot dogs John already has
Number of hot dogs John needs to buy = 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs

Step 4: Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to buy.
Number of packs of hot dogs needed =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John invited 20 people to the birthday party.
2. Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
3. He already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
4. A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2.

To calculate how much John needs to spend on hot dogs, we need to find out how many hot dogs he needs to buy.

First, let's calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:
* 20 guests x 2 hot dogs per guest = 40 hot dogs needed

Next, we subtract the 4 hot dogs he already has:
* 40 hot dogs needed - 4 hot dogs already have = 36 hot dogs needed to buy

Now, we need to figure out how many packs of hot dogs he needs to buy.
* 36 hot dogs needed / 6 hot dogs per pack = 6 packs needed

Finally, we can calculate the total cost:
* 6 packs x $2 per pack = $12

Therefore, John needs to spen
