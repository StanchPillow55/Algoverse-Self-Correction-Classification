Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
- For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept 2 hours less each day.
- For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than those two days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Sadie slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Tuesday: 8 hours - 2 hours = 6 hours
Wednesday: 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Sadie slept on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday: 6 hours + 1 hour = 7 hours each

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week.
Monday: 8 hours
Tuesday: 6 hours
Wednesday: 6 hours
Thursday: 7 hours
Friday: 7 hours
Saturday: 7 hours
Sunday: 7 hours
