Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Isabelle's total expenses for the party supplies:
   * Cake ingredients: $12
   * Birthday presents: $43
   * Decorations: $15
   * Invitations: $4
   * Goodie bags: $22
   * Total expenses: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

2. Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, so each person's share would be:
   * Total expenses: $96
   * Number of people splitting the cost: 3 (Isabelle and her two parents)
   * Each person's share: $96 / 3 = $32

Therefore, the final answer is that each person (Isabelle and her two parents) paid $32 for the party supplies.
