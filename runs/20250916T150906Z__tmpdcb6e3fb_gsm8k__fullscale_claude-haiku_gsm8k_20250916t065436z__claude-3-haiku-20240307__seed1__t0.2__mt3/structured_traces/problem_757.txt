To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shirts needed for each size and then add them up to get the total number of shirts ordered.

Given information:
- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large.

Step 1: Find the number of size small shirts needed.
Number of size small shirts = 2 × 11 = 22

Step 2: Find the number of size medium shirts needed.
Number of size medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

Step 3: Find the number of size large shirts needed.
Number of size large shirts = 18 ÷ 2 = 9

Step 4: Find the number of size extra-large shirts needed.
Number of size extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Step 5: Find the total number of shirts ordered.
Total number of shirts = 11

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Extra-small shirts: 
   * 11 students need extra-small shirts

2. Small shirts:
   * Twice as many students need small as extra-small
   * 11 x 2 = 22 students need small shirts

3. Medium shirts:
   * Four less than the number of small students need medium
   * 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts

4. Large shirts:
   * Half as many students need large as medium
   * 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts

5. Extra-large shirts:
   * Six more students need extra-large than large
   * 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts Krissa ordered:
* Extra-small: 11
* Small: 22
* Medium: 18
* Large: 9
* Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts ordered: 11 + 22 + 18 +

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- 11 students need size extra-small
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium
- Half as many students need size large as size medium
- Six more students need size extra-large than large

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who need size small.
Number of students who need size small = 2 × 11 = 22 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who need size medium.
Number of students who need size medium = 22 - 4 = 18 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who need size large.
Number of students who need size large = 18 ÷ 2 = 9 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who need size extra-large.
Number of students who need size extra-large = 9 + 6 = 15 students

Step 5: Calculate the total number of shirts Krissa ordered.
