To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs, and then calculate the amount of seasoning needed based on the given ratio.

Given information:
- Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef.
- Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef.
- Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of ground beef required to make 80 meatballs.
Number of pounds of ground beef = Total meatballs / Meatballs per pound
Number of pounds of ground beef = 80 meatballs / 16 meatballs per pound
Number of pounds of ground beef = 5 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of seasoning required for 5 pounds of ground beef.
Amount of seasoning = Number of pounds of ground beef × Seasoning per pound
Amount of seasoning = 5 pounds × 2 tablespoons per pound
Amount of seasoning = 10 tablespoons
