To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cows the farmer needs to have in order to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Given information:
- The farmer extracts 5 liters of milk a day from a cow.
- The farmer has 3 cows.
- The farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows the farmer currently has.
Total milk produced by 3 cows per day = 3 Ã— 5 liters = 15 liters

Step 2: Calculate the additional amount of milk needed to reach the target of 25 liters per day.
Additional milk needed per day = 25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Step 3: Calculate the number of additional cows needed to produce the additional 10 liters of milk per day.
Number of additional cows needed = Additional milk needed per day / Milk produced per cow per day
Number of additional cows needed = 10 liters / 5 liters = 2
