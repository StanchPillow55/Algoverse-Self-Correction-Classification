To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of novels Regina has written this year.

Given information:
- Regina wrote 9 novels last year.
- The 9 novels written last year is 3/4 of the number of novels she has written this year.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of novels written last year and this year.
Let x = the number of novels Regina has written this year.
Then, 9 = 3/4 × x

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
9 = 3/4 × x
x = 9 / (3/4)
x = 9 × (4/3)
x = 12

Therefore, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final answer: Regina has written 12 novels this year.
