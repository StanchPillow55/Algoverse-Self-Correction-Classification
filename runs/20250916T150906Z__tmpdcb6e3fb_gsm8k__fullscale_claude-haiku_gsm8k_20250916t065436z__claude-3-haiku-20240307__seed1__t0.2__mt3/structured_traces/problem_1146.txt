Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adam has $100 to start with.
- He can buy rocks for $5 each and sell them for $7 each.
- He invests all his money in the rock stand.
- He only sells 60% of his inventory.

Step 1: Calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100.
Number of rocks = $100 / $5 per rock = 20 rocks

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Adam can make by selling 60% of his inventory.
Total revenue = 60% of 20 rocks × $7 per rock = 12 rocks × $7 = $84

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rocks Adam bought.
Total cost = 20 rocks × $5 per rock = $100

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Adam loses.
Amount lost = Total cost - Total revenue
Amount lost = $100 - $84 = $16

Therefore, Adam loses $16 on the rock stand.

Final answer: Adam loses $16 on the rock stand.
