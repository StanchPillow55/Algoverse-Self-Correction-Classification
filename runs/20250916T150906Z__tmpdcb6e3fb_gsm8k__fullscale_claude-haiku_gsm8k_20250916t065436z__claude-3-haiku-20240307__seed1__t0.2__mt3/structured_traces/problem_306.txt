Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
- Half of the remaining loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening.

Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) × 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves remaining after the morning sales.
Loaves remaining after morning sales = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning
Loaves remaining after morning sales = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.
Half of the remaining 20 loaves = (1/2) × 20 = 10 loaves.
These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 10 / 2 = 5

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.
- Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.
- Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.

Step 1: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of 60 loaves = (2/3) × 60 = 40 loaves sold in the morning.

Step 2: Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales.
Loaves left after morning sales = Total loaves - Loaves sold in the morning
Loaves left after morning sales = 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.

Step 3: Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening.
Half of the remaining 20 loaves = (1/2) × 20 = 10 loaves.
These 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, so:
Loaves sold in the afternoon = 10 / 2 = 5 lo
