Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The box of sweets contains 15 packs.
- Each pack has 60 pieces.
- Anne kept 2 packs and gave the rest to her 10 friends equally.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces in the box.
Total pieces in the box = Number of packs × Pieces per pack
Total pieces in the box = 15 × 60 = 900 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces Anne kept.
Pieces Anne kept = Number of packs kept × Pieces per pack
Pieces Anne kept = 2 × 60 = 120 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Anne gave to her friends.
Pieces given to friends = Total pieces in the box - Pieces Anne kept
Pieces given to friends = 900 - 120 = 780 pieces

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces each friend received.
Pieces per friend = Pieces given to friends / Number of friends
Pieces per friend = 780 / 10 = 78
