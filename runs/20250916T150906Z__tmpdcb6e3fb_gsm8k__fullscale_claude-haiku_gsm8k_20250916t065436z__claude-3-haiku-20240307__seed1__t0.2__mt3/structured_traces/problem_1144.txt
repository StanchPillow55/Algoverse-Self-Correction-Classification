To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
2. Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.

Step 1: Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.

Total number of passengers = Number of men + Number of women
84 = 5x + 9x
84 = 14x
x = 6

Therefore, the number of men on the bus initially is 5x = 5 × 6 = 30.
The number of women on the bus initially is 9x = 9 × 6 = 54.

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.
Number of women who have remained on the bus = Initial number of

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
- 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop.

Step 1: Find the total number of men and women on the bus.
Total number of passengers = 84
Ratio of men to women = 5:9
Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.
Total number of passengers = 5x + 9x = 14x
84 = 14x
x = 6
Number of men = 5x = 5 × 6 = 30
Number of women = 9x = 9 × 6 = 54

Step 2: Find the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.
Number of women who alighted = 20
Number of women remaining on the bus = 54 - 20 = 34

Therefore, the number of
