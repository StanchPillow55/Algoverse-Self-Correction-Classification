To solve this problem, we need to find the selling price of the magazines and then calculate the profit.

Given information:
- Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them.
- Trinity bought the magazines at $72.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of the magazines.
Selling price = 11/8 Ã— $72
Selling price = $99

Step 2: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Profit = $99 - $72
Profit = $27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.
