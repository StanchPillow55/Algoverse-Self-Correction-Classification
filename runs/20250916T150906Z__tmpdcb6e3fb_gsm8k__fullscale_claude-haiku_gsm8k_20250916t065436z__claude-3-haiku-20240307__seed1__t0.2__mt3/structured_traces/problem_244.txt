Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
- Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries.
- Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
- Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
- Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
- In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fries that Billy took.
Kyle took 5 fries, so Billy took twice as many, which is 2 Ã— 5 = 10 fries.

Step 2: Calculate the number of fries that Colby took.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fries taken from Griffin.
Fries taken by Kyle: 5
Fries taken by Billy: 10
Fries taken by Colby: 2
Total fries taken

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them.
   * So, Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
   * Kyle took 5 fries, so Billy took 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
   * Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
   * We don't know how many fries Ginger gave Griffin yet.

5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
   * Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
   * Griffin now has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

6. In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.
   * We know that Griffin started with 24 fries, an

4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
   * We don't know how many fries Ginger gave yet, so let's call this number x.
   * So, Griffin now has 9 + x fries.

5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
   * So, Griffin now has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
