Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Henry needs to assemble 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.
2. For each car, he needs 4 wheels.
3. For each motorcycle, he needs 2 wheels.
4. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
   * 57 cars x 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
5. The total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
   * 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels
6. The total number of wheels needed for all the toys is:
   * 228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels
7. Henry has a box with 650 wheels.
8. To find the number of wheels left, we subtract the total wheels needed from the total wheels in the box:
   * 650 wheels - 374 wheels = 276 wheels

Therefore, the final answer is that there will be 276 wheels left in the box.
