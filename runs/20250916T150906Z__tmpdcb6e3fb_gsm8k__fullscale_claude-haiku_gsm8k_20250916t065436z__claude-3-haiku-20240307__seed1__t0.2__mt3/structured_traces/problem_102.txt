To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays and the number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekends, then add them together to find the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week.

Given information:
- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays.
- John drinks a glass of water before going to bed on weekdays.
- John drinks a soda with dinner on weekends instead of water.

Step 1: Calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays.
Number of glasses of water per weekday = 3 (breakfast, lunch, dinner) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses
Number of weekdays in a week = 5 (Monday to Friday)
Total number of glasses of water during the weekdays = 4 glasses Ã— 5 days = 20 glasses

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekends.
Number of glasses of water per weekend day = 0 (John drinks soda with dinner instead)
Number of weekend days in a week = 2

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John has a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays.
- John has a glass of water before going to bed on weekdays.
- On weekends, John has a soda with dinner instead of water.

To calculate the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to find the number of glasses on weekdays and the number of glasses on weekends, then add them together.

Weekdays:
* John has 4 glasses of water per weekday (1 with breakfast, 1 with lunch, 1 with dinner, 1 before bed)
* There are 5 weekdays in a week

Weekends:
* John has 1 soda with dinner on each weekend day (Saturday and Sunday)
* He does not have any glasses of water on the weekends
* So, the total number of glasses of water on weekends is:
