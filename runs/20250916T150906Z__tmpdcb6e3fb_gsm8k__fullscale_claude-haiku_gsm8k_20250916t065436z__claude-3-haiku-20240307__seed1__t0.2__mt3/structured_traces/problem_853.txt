To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Given information:
- There are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
- It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room.

Step 1: Find the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
One-half of the total rooms = 90 รท 2 = 45 rooms

Step 2: Calculate the total time it would take to clean 45 rooms.
Time to clean one room = 20 minutes
Time to clean 45 rooms = 45 ร 20 minutes = 900 minutes

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
Total time in hours = 900 minutes รท 60 minutes per hour = 15 hours

Therefore, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
