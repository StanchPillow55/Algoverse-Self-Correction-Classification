Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
- Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with 15 cards in each box.
- She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
- She passed out 5 cards to her family.
- She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pre-made cards Erica received from her dad.
Number of pre-made cards = 2 boxes Ã— 15 cards per box = 30 cards

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards Erica had initially.
Total initial cards = Cards made by Erica + Pre-made cards from her dad
Total initial cards = 20 + 30 = 50 cards

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Erica passed out.
Cards passed out to classmates = 24
Cards passed out to family = 5
Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with 15 cards in each box.
   * 2 boxes x 15 cards per box = 30 pre-made cards
3. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
4. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
   * Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards
5. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
* Cards made by Erica: 20
* Pre-made cards from her dad: 30
* Cards received from family and friends: 17
* Total cards: 20 + 30 + 17 = 67 cards

Therefore, Erica now has 67 Valentine's Day cards.
