Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bernie has 4 dogs
- The first dog needs to walk 1 mile per day
- The second dog needs to walk 4 miles per day
- The third dog needs to walk 3 miles per day
- On average, the dogs need to walk 3 miles per day

To find the number of miles the last dog needs to walk, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of miles the first 3 dogs need to walk per day
2. Subtract that total from the average number of miles the dogs need to walk per day
3. The remaining miles is what the last dog needs to walk

Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles the first 3 dogs need to walk per day.
Dog 1: 1 mile
Dog 2: 4 miles
Dog 3: 3 miles
Total miles for first 3 dogs = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles

Step 2: Subtract the total miles for the first 3 dogs from the average miles needed per day
