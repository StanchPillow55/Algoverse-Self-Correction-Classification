Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each.
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each.
- Jen has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the yams.
Total revenue from yams = Number of yams × Price per yam
Total revenue from yams = 6 × $1.5 = $9

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sweet potatoes.
Total revenue from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes × Price per sweet potato
Total revenue from sweet potatoes = 10 × $2 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the carrots.
Total revenue from carrots = Number of carrots × Price per carrot
Total revenue from carrots = 4 × $1.25 = $5

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue Jen will earn by selling all the root crops.
Total revenue = Total revenue from

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each.
   * Total value of yams = 6 yams x $1.5 per yam = $9

2. Jen has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each.
   * Total value of sweet potatoes = 10 sweet potatoes x $2 per sweet potato = $20

3. Jen has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each.
   * Total value of carrots = 4 carrots x $1.25 per carrot = $5

4. To calculate the total amount Jen will earn, we add up the values of the yams, sweet potatoes, and carrots:
   * Total earnings = $9 + $20 + $5 = $34

Therefore, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn a total of $34.
