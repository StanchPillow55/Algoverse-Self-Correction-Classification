To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then find the net profit.

Given information:
- The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of bread per sandwich.
Cost of bread per sandwich = Cost of bread per loaf / Number of sandwiches per loaf
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich.
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per sandwich.
Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of bread per sandwich.
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches per loaf = 10
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich.
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per sandwich.
Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cost of Bread:
   * The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf
   * Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches
   * So the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

2. Cost of Cheese and Condiments:
   * The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
   * So the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

3. Total Cost per Sandwich:
   * Cost of Bread: $0.30
   * Cost of Cheese and Condiments: $3.00
   * Total Cost per Sandwich: $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

4. Revenue per Sandwich:
   * The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each
   * Revenue per Sandwich: $7.00

5. Net Profit per Sandwich:
