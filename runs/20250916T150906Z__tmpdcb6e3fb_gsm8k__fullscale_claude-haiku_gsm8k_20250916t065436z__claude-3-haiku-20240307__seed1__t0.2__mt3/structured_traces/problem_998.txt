Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There were 100 guests at the wedding reception.
- Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies.
- The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.
- Each person in the church next door got 15 cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies brought to the wedding reception.
Total cookies = Number of guests × Cookies per guest
Total cookies = 100 × 15 = 1,500 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies given to the church next door.
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 of the total cookies
Cookies given to the church = 1/2 × 1,500 = 750 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of people in the church next door.
Number of people in the church = Cookies given to the church / Cookies per person
Number of people in the church = 750 / 15 = 50 people

Therefore, the number of people in the church next door is 50.
