Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
- There are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Step 1: Calculate how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.
Bare hands: 12 pounds per day
Iron pickaxe: 2 × 12 = 24 pounds per day
Steel pickaxe: 1.5 × 24 = 36 pounds per day

Step 2: Calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.
40 dwarves × 36 pounds per day = 1,440 pounds per day

Step 3: Calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickax

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, which is 24 pounds of ore per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (0.5 x 24) = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month (30 days):
* 1 dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day
* 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 x 36 = 1,440 pounds of ore per day
* In a month (30 days), they can mine 1,440 x 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore

Therefore, the final answer is:
43,200 pounds of ore

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
- There are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
- The time period is 1 month with 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore 1 dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.
Ore mined with bare hands per day = 12 pounds
Ore mined with iron pickaxe per day = 12 pounds × 2 = 24 pounds
Ore mined with steel pickaxe per day = 24 pounds × 1.5 = 36 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in 1 day with steel pickaxes.
Ore mined per day by 40
