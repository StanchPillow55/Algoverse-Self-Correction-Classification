Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.
- Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.
- Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
- Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Jenny's son eats in a week.
Cookies per day × Number of days = Total cookies for son
4 cookies × 5 days = 20 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week.
Cookies per day × Number of days = Total cookies for husband
1 cookie × 7 days = 7 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies used by Jenny's son and husband in a week.
Total cookies for son + Total cookies for husband = Total cookies used by son and husband
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Step 4: Calculate the number of cookies left in the bag for Jenny

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.

2. Her son gets 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week.
   * 4 cookies x 5 days = 20 cookies per week

3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
   * 1 cookie x 7 days = 7 cookies per week

4. To find how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies her son and husband eat from the total cookies in the bag.
   * Total cookies in the bag: 36
   * Cookies her son eats: 20
   * Cookies her husband eats: 7
   * Cookies Jenny eats: 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 cookies per week

Therefore, the final answer is that Jenny eats 9 cookies per week.
