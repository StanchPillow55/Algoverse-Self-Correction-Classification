Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
- After the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards.
- In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.
- In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month.
Initial number of cards = 20
Cards collected in the first month = 3 × 20 = 60 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the second month.
Cards collected in the second month = Cards collected in the first month - 20
Cards collected in the second month = 60 - 20 = 40 cards

Step 3: Calculate the combined number of cards Elaine collected in the first and second months.
Combined cards collected in the first and second months = 60 + 40 = 100 cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial number of Pokemon cards Elaine had: 20

2. After the first month, she collected three times that number:
   * 3 x 20 = 60 cards

3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than the first month:
   * 60 - 20 = 40 cards

4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months:
   * First month: 60 cards
   * Second month: 40 cards
   * Combined cards from first and second months: 60 + 40 = 100 cards
   * Twice the combined cards: 2 x 100 = 200 cards

5. Total number of Pokemon cards Elaine has now:
   * Initial cards: 20
   * First month: 60
   * Second month: 40
   * Third month: 200
   * Total: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards
