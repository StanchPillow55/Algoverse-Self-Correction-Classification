To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
2. Calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
Number of occupied beds initially = 1/5 × 1000 = 200 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.
The hospital admits 50 patients each day.
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days
Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients
Number of beds occupied after 2 weeks = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 2 weeks
Number of beds occupied after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
2. Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   * 1/5 of 1000 = 200 beds are occupied initially.
   * Therefore, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

3. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
   * Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is 50 x 14 = 700 patients.

4. To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
   * Initial unoccupied beds: 800
   * New patients admitted over 2 weeks: 700
   * Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 800 - 700 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- 1/5 of the beds are currently occupied.
- 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
- We need to calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beds that are currently occupied.
Total beds = 1000
Occupied beds = 1/5 of 1000 = 1000 × 1/5 = 200 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks.
Patients admitted per day = 50
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14
Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 × 14 = 700 patients
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.
Total beds = 1000
