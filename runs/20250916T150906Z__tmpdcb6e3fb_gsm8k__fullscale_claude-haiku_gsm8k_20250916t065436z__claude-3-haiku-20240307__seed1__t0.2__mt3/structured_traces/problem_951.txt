Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The paper used for the book is 100 pages to the inch.
- Each paper is printed on both sides, with one page of the book printed on each side.
- The book is 1.5 inches thick.

To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to calculate the number of pages per inch and then multiply it by the thickness of the book.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages per inch.
Since the paper is 100 pages to the inch and each paper is printed on both sides, we can calculate the number of pages per inch as follows:
Number of pages per inch = 100 pages per inch × 2 sides per page = 200 pages per inch

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages in the book.
Total number of pages = Number of pages per inch × Thickness of the book
Total number of pages = 200 pages per inch × 1.5 inches
Total number of pages = 300 pages

Therefore, the book has 300 pages.
