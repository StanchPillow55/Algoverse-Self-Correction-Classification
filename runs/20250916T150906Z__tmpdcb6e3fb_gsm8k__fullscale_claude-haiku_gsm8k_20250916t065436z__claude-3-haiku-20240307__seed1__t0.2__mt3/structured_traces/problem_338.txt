To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in the smallest group.

Given information:
- The class has 200 students.
- The class is split into 3 groups.
- 2 of the groups are equal in number.
- The third group (the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of students in the two equal groups.
- Let y be the number of students in the smallest group.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of students.
Total number of students = Number of students in the two equal groups + Number of students in the smallest group
200 = 2x + y

Step 2: Find the relationship between the number of students in the two equal groups and the smallest group.
The smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so:
y = x - 10

Step 3: Substitute the expression for y in the equation from Step 1.
200 = 2x + (x - 10)
200 = 3x - 10

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have a class of 200 students.
2. The class is split into 3 groups.
3. 2 of the groups are equal in number.
4. The third group (the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other two groups.

Let's call the number of students in the two equal groups "x".

Since the third group is 10 less than each of the other two groups, we can represent the number of students in the third group as "x - 10".

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up an equation:
x + x + (x - 10) = 200

Simplifying this equation:
3x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

Therefore, the number of students in the two equal groups is 70.

The number of students in the smallest group is:
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60

So, the final answer is that the smallest group has 60 students.
