To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a temperature that is at least 40 degrees.

Given information:
- Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
- One mug of water is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other bottle.
- After mixing the two, Donny is able to drink the water.

Step 1: Set up the equation to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle.
Let x be the temperature of the second bottle.

The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle).
The total heat content of the mixed water is the sum of the heat content of the two bottles.

Heat content = (Volume × Temperature)
Heat content = (4 × 33) + (1 × x) =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
- He has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- After mixing the two, he is now able to drink the water.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to calculate the final temperature of the mixed water in the water bottle.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water in the water bottle.
Total water = 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug + 1 ounce from the other mug = 5 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total heat content of the water in the water bottle.
Heat content = (4 ounces × 33 degrees) + (1 ounce × unknown temperature)

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the unknown temperature.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to calculate the final temperature of the mixed water in the water bottle.

Step 1: Calculate the total volume of water in the water bottle.
Total volume = 4 ounces (from 33-degree mug) + 1 ounce (from unknown-temperature mug) = 5 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total heat content of the water in the water bottle.
Heat content = (4 ounces × 33 degrees) + (1 ounce × unknown temperature)
