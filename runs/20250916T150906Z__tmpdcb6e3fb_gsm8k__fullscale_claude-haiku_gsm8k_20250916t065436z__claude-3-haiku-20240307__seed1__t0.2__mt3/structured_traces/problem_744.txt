To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of animals that Melissa needs to groom and then divide it by the number of days in a week to determine the number of animals she will groom each day.

Given information:
- Melissa has 8 dogs that need to be bathed.
- Melissa has 5 cats that need their nails clipped.
- Melissa has 3 birds that need their wings trimmed.
- Melissa has 12 horses that need to be brushed.

Step 1: Find the total number of animals Melissa needs to groom.
Total animals = Dogs + Cats + Birds + Horses
Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals

Step 2: Divide the total number of animals by the number of days in a week to find the number of animals Melissa will groom each day.
Number of days in a week = 7 days
Number of animals groomed per day = Total animals / Number of days in a week
Number of animals groomed per day = 28 animals / 7 days = 4
