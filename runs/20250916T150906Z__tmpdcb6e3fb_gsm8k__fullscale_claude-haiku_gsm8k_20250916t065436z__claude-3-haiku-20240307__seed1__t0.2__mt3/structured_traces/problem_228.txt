To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces they can add per minute and then calculate the time it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Kalinda's mom can add per minute.
Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute = 1/2 × Kalinda's pieces per minute
Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute = 1/2 × 4 = 2 pieces per minute

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces they can add per minute.
Total pieces per minute = Kalinda's pieces per minute + Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute
Total pieces per minute = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take them to complete the puzzle.
Time to complete the puzzle = Total number of pieces / Total pieces per minute
Time to complete the puzzle =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces added per minute by Kalinda and her mom.
Kalinda's rate: 4 pieces per minute
Kalinda's mom's rate: 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute
Total pieces added per minute: 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Step 2: Calculate the total time it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle.
Total pieces in the puzzle: 360
Pieces added per minute: 6
Time to complete the puzzle = Total pieces / Pieces added per minute
Time to complete the puzzle = 360 / 6 = 60 minutes

Step 3: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
Total time in minutes: 60 minutes
Total time in hours = 60 minutes / 60 minutes per hour =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate Kalinda's rate of adding pieces.
Kalinda's rate = 4 pieces per minute

Step 2: Calculate Kalinda's mom's rate of adding pieces.
Kalinda's mom's rate = 1/2 × Kalinda's rate = 1/2 × 4 = 2 pieces per minute

Step 3: Calculate the total rate of adding pieces per minute.
Total rate = Kalinda's rate + Kalinda's mom's rate
Total rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take to complete the puzzle.
Total time = Total number of pieces / Total rate of adding pieces
Total time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes
