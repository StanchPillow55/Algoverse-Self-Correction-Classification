To solve this problem, we need to calculate the scores for Ava and Emma, and then find the difference between their scores.

Given information:
- Ava and Emma each play one level of the video game.
- They receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on.
- They receive 5 points for each berry they collect.
- They receive 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level.
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Step 1: Calculate Ava's score.
Ava's enemies jumped on = 8 more than Emma
Ava's berries collected = 3 more than Emma
Ava's time left on the timer = 4 seconds slower than Emma

Ava's score = (Ava's enemies jumped on × 10) + (Ava's berries collected × 5) + (Ava's time left on the timer × 30)

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ava and Emma each play one level of the video game.
- They receive:
  - 10 points for every enemy they jump on
  - 5 points for each berry they collect
  - 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Step 1: Calculate Ava's score.
Ava's enemies jumped on = Emma's enemies jumped on + 8 = x + 8
Ava's berries collected = Emma's berries collected + 3 = y + 3
Ava's time left on timer = Emma's time left on timer - 4 = z - 4

Ava's score = (x + 8) × 10 + (y + 3) × 5 + (z - 4) × 30
