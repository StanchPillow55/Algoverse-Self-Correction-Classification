Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- It rained 2 inches on Monday.
- The expected rain on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total.

Step 1: Calculate the expected rain on Tuesday.
Monday's total rain = 2 inches
Twice of Monday's total = 2 Ã— 2 = 4 inches
Expected rain on Tuesday = 4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches

Therefore, the amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

Final answer:
The amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.
