Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.
- One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75.
- Adam paid the cashier $15.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candies.
Cost of 7 candies of type A = 7 × $0.5 = $3.5
Cost of 10 candies of type B = 10 × $0.75 = $7.5
Total cost of the candies = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Step 2: Calculate the change Adam received.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost of the candies
Change = $15 - $11 = $4

Therefore, the change Adam received is $4.
