Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original dinner bill was $50.

2. Your wife wants to evenly split the check, which means you and your wife would each pay half of the $50 bill.
   * $50 / 2 = $25 each

3. In addition to splitting the bill, your wife wants you to pay a 20% tip on the $50 total bill.
   * 20% of $50 = 0.20 x $50 = $10 tip

4. To calculate the total amount you ended up paying, we add the half of the bill ($25) and the tip ($10):
   * $25 + $10 = $35

Therefore, the total amount you ended up paying for the $50 dinner bill, after splitting it evenly with your wife and paying a 20% tip, is $35.

Final answer: $35
