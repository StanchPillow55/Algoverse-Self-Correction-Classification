Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- She has prepared $20 for the purchase.
- Each crayon costs $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 × $2 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the change Violetta will get.
Change = Amount prepared - Total cost
Change = $20 - $10 = $10

Therefore, the change Violetta will get is $10.

Final answer: Violetta will get $10 in change.
