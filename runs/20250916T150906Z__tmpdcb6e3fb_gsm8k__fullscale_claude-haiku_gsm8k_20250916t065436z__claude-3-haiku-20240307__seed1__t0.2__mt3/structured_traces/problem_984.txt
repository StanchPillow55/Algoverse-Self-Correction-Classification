To solve this problem, we need to find the number of plants required to fill the flower bed, and then calculate the total cost of the additional plants needed.

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the available space in the flower bed.
Total length of the flower bed = 111 feet
Space required between each plant = 1.5 feet
Available space for the plants = Total length - (Number of plants × Space between each plant)

Step 2: Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the available space.
Available space = 111 feet - (Number of plants × 1.5 feet)
Number of plants = Available space / 1.5 feet

Step 3: Determine the number of additional plants needed.
Total number of plants required = Available space / 1.5 feet
Number of additional plants needed = Total number of plants require

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the flower bed that needs to be filled.
Total length of flower bed = 111 feet
Length taken by the 17 flowers Pat already owns = 17 feet (17 flowers x 1 foot per flower)
Remaining length to be filled = 111 feet - 17 feet = 94 feet

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional plants needed to fill the remaining length.
Space needed between each plant = 1.5 feet
Number of additional plants needed = Remaining length / (1 foot + 1.5 feet) = 94 feet / 2.5 feet = 37.6 plants
Since we can't have a fractional plant, we round up to 38

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the flower bed.
Total width of the flower bed = 111 feet

Step 2: Calculate the space needed for each plant.
Space needed for each plant = 1 foot (width of the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants)
Total space needed for each plant = 2.5 feet

Step 3: Calculate the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed.
Number of plants needed = Total width of the flower bed / Space needed for each plant
Number of plants needed = 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4 plants

Since we can't have a fractional plant, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of plants needed = 45
