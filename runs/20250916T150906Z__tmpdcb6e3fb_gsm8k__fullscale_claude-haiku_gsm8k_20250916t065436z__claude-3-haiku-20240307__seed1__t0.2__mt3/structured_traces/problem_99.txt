Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary had before receiving the new ones.
Number of window ledges × Number of potted plants per ledge = Total number of potted plants
40 × 2 = 80 potted plants

Step 2: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has after receiving the new ones.
Total number of potted plants before + Number of new potted plants = Total number of potted plants after
80 + 18 = 98 potted plants

Step 3: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away to friends and family.
Number of window ledges = Number of potted plants to be given away
40 potted plants

Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will remain with.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary had before receiving the new 18 plants.
Number of window ledges = 40
Number of potted plants per ledge = 2
Total number of potted plants before new plants = 40 × 2 = 80 plants

Step 2: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has after receiving the new 18 plants.
Total number of potted plants after new plants = 80 + 18 = 98 plants

Step 3: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away to friends and family.
Number of potted plants to be given away = 40 (one from each ledge)

Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will remain with.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
   * Total number of potted plants on the window ledges = 2 plants x 40 ledges = 80 plants

2. Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
   * Total number of potted plants Mary has now = 80 plants + 18 new plants = 98 plants

3. Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family.
   * Number of potted plants Mary will give away = 40 plants

4. To find the number of potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has.
   * Number of potted plants Mary will remain with = 98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.
