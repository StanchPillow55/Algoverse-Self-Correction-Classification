Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores.
2. He did his chores for 3 weeks.
   * So, his total allowance earned = $6 x 3 weeks = $18

3. He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.
   * Number of ice cream cones = 4 (Ryan + 3 friends)
   * Cost of each ice cream cone = $1.25
   * Total cost of ice cream cones = 4 x $1.25 = $5

4. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each.
   * Number of movie tickets needed = 4 (Ryan + 3 friends)
   * Cost of each movie ticket = $6.50

To calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total allowance he earned, and then divide the remaining amount by the cost of each movie ticket.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores.
- He did his chores for 3 weeks.
- He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.
- Movie tickets cost $6.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of allowance Ryan earned.
Allowance per week × Number of weeks = Total allowance
$6 × 3 weeks = $18

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.
Cost per cone × Number of cones = Total cost of ice cream cones
$1.25 × 4 cones = $5

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money Ryan has after buying the ice cream cones.
Total allowance - Total cost of ice cream cones = Remaining amount
$18 - $5 = $13

Step 4: Calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy.
Remaining amount / Cost per ticket = Number of movie tickets
$13 / $6

2. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.

3. Now they want to go to the movies, and the tickets cost $6.50 each.
   * Remaining money after buying ice cream = $18 - $5 = $13

4. To find how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each ticket.
   * Number of movie tickets = $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.
