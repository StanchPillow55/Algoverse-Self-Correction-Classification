To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of candy and then divide it equally among the three of them.

Given information:
- Robert had 3 pounds of candy.
- Cindy had 5 pounds of candy.
- Aaron had 4 pounds of candy.

Step 1: Find the total amount of candy.
Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Step 2: Divide the total candy equally among the three of them.
Amount of candy each person would have = Total candy / Number of people
Amount of candy each person would have = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

Therefore, if Robert, Cindy, and Aaron decide to pool and share their candy equally, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.

Final answer: Each person would have 4 pounds of candy.
