Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Billy's initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
- After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0.50 per hour
- On his first anniversary, he was given a raise of $1.00 per hour
- Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary
- Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours

Step 1: Calculate Billy's hourly rate after the first 2 months.
Billy's initial hourly rate: $10 per hour
Raise after 2 months: $0.50 per hour
Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Step 2: Calculate Billy's hourly rate after his first anniversary.
Billy's hourly rate after 2 months: $10.50 per hour
Raise on his first anniversary: $1.00 per hour
Billy's hourly rate after his first anniversary: $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.
