Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling.
- Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson.

Step 1: Calculate how many points Nikita scored.
Half of Pierson's score = 278 รท 2 = 139 points
Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

Step 2: Calculate the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita.
Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150 = 428 points

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points.

Final answer: Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points.
