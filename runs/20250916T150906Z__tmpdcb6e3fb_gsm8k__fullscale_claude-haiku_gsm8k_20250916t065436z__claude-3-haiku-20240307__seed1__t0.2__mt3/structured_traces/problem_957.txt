To solve this problem, we need to find Shawna's age and then use that information to calculate her father's age.

Given information:
- Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
- Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya.
- Aliya is 3 years old.

Step 1: Find Shawna's age.
Shawna's age = Aliya's age × 3
Shawna's age = 3 × 3 = 9 years old

Step 2: Find Shawna's father's age.
Shawna's father's age = Shawna's age × 5
Shawna's father's age = 9 × 5 = 45 years old

Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.
