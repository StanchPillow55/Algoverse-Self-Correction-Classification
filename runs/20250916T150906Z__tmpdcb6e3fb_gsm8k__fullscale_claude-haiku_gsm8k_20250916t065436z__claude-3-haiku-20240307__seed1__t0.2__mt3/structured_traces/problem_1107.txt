To solve this problem, we need to find the total school population and then calculate the number of girls in the school.

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can use the following equation to find the total school population:
40% of total school population = 240 boys
Total school population = 240 boys / 0.40
Total school population = 600 students

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.
Total school population = 600 students
Number of boys = 240 students
Number of girls = Total school population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

Final answer: There are 360 girls in the school.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

To find the number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total school population, and then subtract the number of boys from the total to get the number of girls.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Since 40% of the school population is 240 boys, we can use this to find the total school population.

Let the total school population be x.
40% of x = 240 boys
0.40x = 240
x = 240 / 0.40
x = 600

Therefore, the total school population is 600 students.

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.
Total school population = 600 students
Number of boys = 240 students
Number of girls = Total school population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

To find the number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total school population, and then subtract the number of boys from the total to get the number of girls.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can use the following equation:
40% of total population = 240 boys
Total population = 240 boys / 0.40 (40% expressed as a decimal)
Total population = 600 students

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.
Total population = Number of boys + Number of girls
600 = 240 + Number of girls
Number of girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.
