Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
- There is a special size box that has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
Regular box size = 100 pods
Special box size = Regular box size + 20% of regular box size
Special box size = 100 + (0.20 Ã— 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pod for the regular box.
Cost per pod for regular box = $12 / 100 pods = $0.12 per pod

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pod for the special box.
Cost per pod for special box = $12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Step 4: Calculate the number of cycles you can run for $1 with the special box.
Cost per cycle = $0.10 per pod
Number of cycles per $1 = $1 /

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
2. The special size box has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.
   * To calculate the number of pods in the special box:
     * 100 pods + 20% of 100 pods = 100 + (0.20 x 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods
3. The question asks how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 if 1 pod is used per cycle.
   * To calculate this, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with the special box.
   * Cost of special box: $12
   * Number of pods in special box: 120
   * Cycles per $1 = (120 pods / $12) = 10 cycles per $1

Therefore, the final answer is:
You can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new special box for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.
