To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Harold spends on his daily activities and then subtract it from the total time in a day to find his free time.

Given information:
- Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night.
- He works 2 hours less than he sleeps.
- He walks his dog for an hour each day.

Step 1: Calculate the time Harold spends on sleeping.
Time spent sleeping = 10 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time Harold spends on working.
Time spent working = Time spent sleeping - 2 hours
Time spent working = 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time Harold spends on walking his dog.
Time spent walking the dog = 1 hour

Step 4: Calculate the total time Harold spends on his daily activities.
Total time spent on daily activities = Time spent sleeping + Time spent working + Time spent walking the dog
Total time spent on daily activities = 10 hours + 8 hours + 1 hour = 19 hours

Step 5: Calculate Harold's free time.
