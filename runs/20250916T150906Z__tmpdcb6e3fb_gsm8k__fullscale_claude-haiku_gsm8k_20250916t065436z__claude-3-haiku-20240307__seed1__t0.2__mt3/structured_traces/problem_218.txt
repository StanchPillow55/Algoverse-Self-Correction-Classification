Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old now.

Step 1: Find Adrian's age.
Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's age.
Harriet's age = 21 years
Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total age of the three people.
Total age = Adrian's age + Harriet's age + Zack's age
Total age = 63 + 21 + 42 = 126 years

Step 4: Calculate the average age of the three people.
Average age = Total age / 3
Average age = 126 / 3 = 42 years

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old now.

Step 1: Find Adrian's age.
Since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age as:
Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's age.
We know that Harriet is half the age of Zack, so we can calculate Zack's age as:
Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the average age of the three in three years.
In three years, the ages will be:
- Adrian: 63 + 3 = 66 years old
- Harriet: 21 + 3
