To solve this problem, we need to find the weight of the 2010 penny and then add it to the weight of the 1959 penny to get the combined weight of the two pennies.

Given information:
- The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
- The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

Step 1: Find the weight of the 2010 penny.
Weight of the 2010 penny = 3/4 × Weight of the 1959 penny
Weight of the 2010 penny = 3/4 × 48 grains = 36 grains

Step 2: Find the combined weight of the two pennies.
Combined weight = Weight of the 2010 penny + Weight of the 1959 penny
Combined weight = 36 grains + 48 grains = 84 grains

Therefore, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.
