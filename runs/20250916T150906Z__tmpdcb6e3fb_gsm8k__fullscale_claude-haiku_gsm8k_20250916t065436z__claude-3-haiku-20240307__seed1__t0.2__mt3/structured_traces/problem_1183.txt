To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of apples that fall out of the tree and the number of apples that Newton picks up and puts in his pocket.

Given information:
- Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
- Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree.
- Throwing the apple into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.
- Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
- Throwing the apple at the tree caused another 6 apples to fall out.
- Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree initially.
Initial apples that fell out of the tree = 2

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw the first apple.
Apples that fell out after the first throw = 5

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and 1 landed on Newton's head.
   * Newton picked up the 2 apples.

2. Newton put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   * Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples on the ground.

3. Newton picked up the 5 new apples, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw the remaining 1 at the tree.
   * Newton now has 4 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples on the ground.

4. Newton picked up the 6 new apples.
   * Newton now has 4 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples.

Adding it all up:
* Initially: 2 apples
* After first throw: 1 apple in pocket, 5 new apples
* After second throw: 4 apples in pocket, 6

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and Newton picked them up.
2. Newton put one of the apples in his pocket and threw the other one back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Newton picked up the 5 apples that fell, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
4. This caused another 6 apples to fall.
5. Newton picked up all the remaining apples.

Let's calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home:
* Initial 2 apples
* 5 apples from the first throw
* 6 apples from the second throw
* Total = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 apples

Therefore, the final answer is that Newton brought home 13 apples.
