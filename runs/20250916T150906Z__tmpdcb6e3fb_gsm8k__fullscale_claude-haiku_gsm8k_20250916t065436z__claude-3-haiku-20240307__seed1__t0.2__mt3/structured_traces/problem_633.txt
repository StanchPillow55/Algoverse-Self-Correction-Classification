To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Given information:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the relative speed between Bob and Tom.
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour = 15 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Final answer: It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.
