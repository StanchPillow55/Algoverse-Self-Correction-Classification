Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rose starts by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each:
   * 3 flowers x 5 petals each = 15 petals

2. She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each:
   * 4 flowers x 6 petals each = 24 petals

3. She then adds 5 flowers with 4 petals each:
   * 5 flowers x 4 petals each = 20 petals

4. Lastly, she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each:
   * 6 flowers x 7 petals each = 42 petals

5. Now we add up the total number of petals from all the flowers she picked:
   * 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals

6. However, she drops 1 of each type of flower, so we need to subtract those:
   * 1 flower with 5 petals
   * 1
