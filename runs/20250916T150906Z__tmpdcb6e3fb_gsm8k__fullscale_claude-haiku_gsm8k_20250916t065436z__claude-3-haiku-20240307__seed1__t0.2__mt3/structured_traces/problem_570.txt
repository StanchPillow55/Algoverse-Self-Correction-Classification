Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has $70 to spend.
- He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
- From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
- For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter can spend each day.
Total amount: $70
Number of days: 7 days
Amount per day = $70 / 7 days = $10 per day

Step 2: Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday through Wednesday.
Number of days: 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday)
Amount spent per day: $10
Cost of each wooden action figure: $5
Number of wooden action figures = (4 days × $10 per day) / $5 per figure = 8 wooden action figures

Step 3: Calculate how much money Peter has left for the rest of the week.
Total amount: $70
Amount spent on wooden action figures: 8 figures × $

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Peter has $70 to spend.
2. He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
4. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on the wooden action figures:
* 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) x $5 per figure = $20 spent on wooden figures

Now, let's calculate how much money Peter has left to spend on the plastic action figures:
* $70 total - $20 spent on wooden figures = $50 remaining

Since the plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can divide the remaining $50 by $2 to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy:
* $50 / $2 per figure = 25 plastic action figures

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
* 4 wooden action

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has $70 to spend.
- He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
- From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
- For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter can spend each day.
Total amount: $70
Number of days in a week: 7
Amount per day = $70 / 7 = $10

Step 2: Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday through Wednesday.
Number of days: 4
Amount spent per day: $5
Total amount spent on wooden action figures = 4 × $5 = $20

Step 3: Calculate how much money Peter has left for the rest of the week.
Total amount: $70
Amount spent on wooden action figures: $20
Amount left = $70 - $20 = $50

Step 4: Calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy for the rest of the week.
