To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds Mack saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days to get the average number of birds seen per day.

Given information:
- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three, he saw none.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week.
Birds seen on days 1 and 2 = 50
Birds seen on day 3 = 0
Birds seen on days 4 and 5 = 120
Birds seen on day 6 = 20
Birds seen on day 7 = 90
Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Mack observed the birds.
Number of days = 7

Step 3: Calculate the

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On days 1 and 2, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day 3, Mack saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, Mack saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, Mack saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, Mack saw 90 birds.

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
2. Divide the total number of birds by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We need to find the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
   * Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
   * Day 3: 0 birds
   * Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
   * Day 6: 20 birds
   * Day 7: 90 birds
   * Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

2. To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days.
   * Number of days = 7
   * Average birds per day = 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40 birds.
