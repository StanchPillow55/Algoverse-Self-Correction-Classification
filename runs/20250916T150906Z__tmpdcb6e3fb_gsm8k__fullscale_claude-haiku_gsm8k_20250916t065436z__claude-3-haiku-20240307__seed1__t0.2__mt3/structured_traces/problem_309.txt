To solve this problem, we need to find the number of new arms and legs a person will grow after drinking the Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days.

Given information:
- The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days.
- The serum will make the drinker grow an extra leg every five days.
- The time period is 15 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new arms the person will grow.
Number of days / Days per new arm = Number of new arms
15 days / 3 days per new arm = 5 new arms

Step 2: Calculate the number of new legs the person will grow.
Number of days / Days per new leg = Number of new legs
15 days / 5 days per new leg = 3 new legs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of new limbs the person will grow.
Total new limbs = New arms + New legs
Total new limbs = 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

Therefore, after 15 days, Helena's Lots-

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* The Lots-of-Limbs Serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days
* The serum also causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days
* We need to find out how many new limbs will be grown after 15 days

First, let's look at the arms:
* After 3 days, the drinker will have grown 1 extra arm
* After 6 days, the drinker will have grown 2 extra arms 
* After 9 days, the drinker will have grown 3 extra arms
* After 12 days, the drinker will have grown 4 extra arms
* After 15 days, the drinker will have grown 5 extra arms

Now let's look at the legs:
* After 5 days, the drinker will have grown 1 extra leg
* After 10 days, the drinker will have grown 2 extra legs
* After 15 days, the drinker

  - An extra arm every 3 days
  - An extra leg every 5 days
* We need to find out how many new limbs will be grown after 15 days

First, let's look at the arms:
* In 15 days, the drinker will grow a new arm every 3 days
* That means they will grow 5 new arms (15 days / 3 days per arm = 5 arms)

Now let's look at the legs:
* In 15 days, the drinker will grow a new leg every 5 days 
* That means they will grow 3 new legs (15 days / 5 days per leg = 3 legs)

To get the total number of new limbs, we add the new arms and new legs:
* 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

Therefore, after 15 days, Helena's Lots-of-
