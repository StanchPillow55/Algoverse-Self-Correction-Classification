To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
3. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
* At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.
* By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
* To calculate the number of people who had voted by midday, we multiply the total number of people by 2/5:
* 5000 × 2/5 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
* By midday (12:00), 2000 people had voted.
* By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.
* To calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday, we subtract the

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station.
- By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
- By 16:00 (4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2/5 of 5000 people = 2/5 × 5000 = 2000 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday (12:00).
Number of people who had not voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00 (4:00 PM).
2/3 of the remaining 3000 people = 2/3 × 3000 = 2000 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At 8:00, 5000 people lined up to vote.

2. By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the 5000 people had voted.
   * 2/5 of 5000 = 2000 people had voted by 12:00.
   * That means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were still waiting to vote.

3. By 16:00 (4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted.
   * 2/3 of 3000 = 2000 people had voted between 12:00 and 16:00.
   * That means 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people were still waiting to vote.

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.
