To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left to find the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.

Given information:
- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
- Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house.
- Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 1: Find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had after selling at the orange house.
Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house, so the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is twice the number of vacuum cleaners she has left, which is 5.
Number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house = 5 Ã— 2 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had after selling at the red house.
Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is 10 + 2 =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
- Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house.
- Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Let's represent the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as "x".

Step 1: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house.
Vacuum cleaners sold at the green house = 1/3 of x

Step 2: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the red house.
Vacuum cleaners sold at the red house = 2

Step 3: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners left after the green and red house sales.
Vacuum cleaners left after green and red house sales = x - (1/3 of x) - 2 = (2/3)x - 2

Step 4: Calculate the number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   * Let's call the original number of vacuum cleaners 'x'.
   * At the green house, she sold 1/3 of x.

2. She then sold 2 more to the red house.
   * After the green house, she had x - (1/3)x = 2/3 x vacuum cleaners left.
   * She then sold 2 more, so she had 2/3 x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   * After the red house, she had 2/3 x - 2 vacuum cleaners left.
   * She sold half of that, which is (1/2)(2/3 x - 2) = 1/3 x - 1 vacuum cleaners.

4. Finally, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
   * After the orange house, she had (2/3 x -
