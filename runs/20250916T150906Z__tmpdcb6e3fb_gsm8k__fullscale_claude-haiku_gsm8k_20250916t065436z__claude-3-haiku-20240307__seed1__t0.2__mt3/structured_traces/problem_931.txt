Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let's say:
- Peter's age = x
- Paul's age = y
- Jean's age = z

Step 2: We know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can express Paul's age in terms of Jean's age.
Paul's age (y) = Jean's age (z) + 10

Step 3: We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.
Peter's age (x) = Paul's age (y) + Jean's age (z)
x = y + z

Step 4: We can substitute the expression for Paul's age (y) into the equation for Peter's age (x).
x = (z + 10) + z
x = 2z + 10

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let Jean's age be x.
Then, Paul's age is x + 10, and Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the combined age of the three people.
Combined age = Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age
100 = (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x
100 = 4x + 20

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
4x + 20 = 100
4x = 80
x = 20

Step 4: Find the ages of the three people.
Jean's age = x = 20 years
Paul's age = x + 10 = 20

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's define the variables:
- Let Peter's age be x.
- Let Paul's age be x + 10, since he is 10 years older than Jean.
- Let Jean's age be x - 10, since Paul is 10 years older than her.

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean.
Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 100

Step 2: Simplify the equation and solve for x.
3x = 100
x = 100 / 3
x = 33.33 years

Step 3: Find Peter's age.
Peter's age = x = 33.33 years

Step 4: Find Paul's age.
