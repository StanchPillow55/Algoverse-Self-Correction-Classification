To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total expenses and the total income, and then find the difference between them to determine the weekly profit.

Given information:
- Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.
- Bottles of bleach cost $2 each, and packs of cloths cost $5 each.
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clients.
Total number of clients = 3 existing clients + 5 potential clients = 8 clients

Step 2: Calculate the total expenses per week.
Expenses for bleach:
Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles × $2 per bottle = $32

Expenses for cloths:
Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients × 1 pack per client = 8 packs
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs × $5

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients.
2. Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
3. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is $2 x 2 = $4 per client.
4. The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5 per client.
5. The total expense per client is $4 + $5 = $9.
6. With 8 clients, the total weekly expenses are 8 x $9 = $72.
7. Kim's total weekly income is $92.
8. The profit is the difference between the total income and total expenses.
9. Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
10. Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit that Kim will make each week is $20.
