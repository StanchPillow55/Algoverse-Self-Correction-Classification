Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.
- A pack of gum has 15 pieces of chewing gum per pack.
- We need to find how many packs of gum he will need to last him 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.
Total pieces of gum needed = Number of pieces per day × Number of days
Total pieces of gum needed = 4 pieces/day × 30 days = 120 pieces of gum

Step 2: Calculate the number of packs of gum needed to last 30 days.
Number of packs needed = Total pieces of gum needed / Pieces of gum per pack
Number of packs needed = 120 pieces / 15 pieces per pack = 8 packs

Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Final answer: 8 packs of gum
