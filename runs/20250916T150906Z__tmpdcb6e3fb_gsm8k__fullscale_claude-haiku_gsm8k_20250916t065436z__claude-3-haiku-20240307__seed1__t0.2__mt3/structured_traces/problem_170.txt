To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each component of the uniform and then add them up to get the total cost of the uniform.

Given information:
- The hat costs $25.
- The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
- The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.

Step 1: Find the cost of the jacket.
Cost of the jacket = 3 × Cost of the hat
Cost of the jacket = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Find the cost of the pants.
Cost of the pants = (Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket) / 2
Cost of the pants = ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50

Step 3: Find the total cost of the uniform.
Total cost of the uniform = Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket + Cost of the pants
Total cost of the uniform = $25 + $75 + $50 = $150

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $150.
