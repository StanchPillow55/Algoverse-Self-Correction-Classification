To solve this problem, we need to find Jerry's current age and then calculate his age in 3 years.

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Step 1: Find Jerry's current age.
Let Jerry's age 5 years ago be x.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x
Jerry's current age = 2x (since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago)

Step 2: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 2x + 3

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jerry will be 2x + 3 years old in 3 years.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Let's represent Jerry's current age as x.

Step 1: Find Jerry's age 5 years ago.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x - 5

Step 2: Find Jerry's current age in terms of his age 5 years ago.
Jerry's current age = 2 × (x - 5)
Jerry's current age = 2x - 10

Step 3: Find how old Jerry will be in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = (2x - 10) + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 2x - 7

Therefore, Jerry will be 2x - 7 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: Jerry will be 2x - 7 years old in 3 years.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Let's represent Jerry's current age as x.

Step 1: Find Jerry's age 5 years ago.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x - 5

Step 2: Find Jerry's current age in terms of his age 5 years ago.
Jerry's current age = 2 × (Jerry's age 5 years ago)
x = 2 × (x - 5)

Step 3: Solve for Jerry's current age (x).
x = 2x - 10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10 years old.

Step 4: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13 years old

Final answer:
Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.
