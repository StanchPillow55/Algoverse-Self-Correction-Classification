Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cost of the color is $40.
- The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
- May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the haircut.
Cost of the haircut = $30 per inch × (10 inches - 8 inches) = $30 × 2 inches = $60

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cut and color.
Total cost = Cost of the color + Cost of the haircut
Total cost = $40 + $60 = $100

Therefore, the total cost of May's hair cut and color is $100.

Final answer: The total cost of May's hair cut and color is $100.
