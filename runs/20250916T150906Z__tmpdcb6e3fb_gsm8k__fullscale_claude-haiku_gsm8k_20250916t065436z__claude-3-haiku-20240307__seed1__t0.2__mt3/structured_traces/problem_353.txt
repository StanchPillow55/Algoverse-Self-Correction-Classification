Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John spent 6 hours boating.
- He spent half the time boating on swimming.
- He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
- The time spent watching shows was 30% of the total time.
- He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent swimming.
Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on boating and swimming.
Total time spent on boating and swimming = 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time spent watching shows.
Time spent watching shows = 3 × 2 hours = 6 hours
This time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time.
Let's call the total time "x".
6 hours = 0.3x
x = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent watching shows.
Time spent watching each show = 2 hours
Total time spent watching shows = 3 × 2 hours = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent.
Total time spent = Time spent on boating and swimming + Time spent watching shows
Total time spent = 9 hours + 6 hours =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Time spent boating:
   * John spent 6 hours boating.

2. Time spent swimming:
   * He spent half the time boating, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. Time spent watching shows:
   * He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
   * Total time watching shows = 3 shows x 2 hours = 6 hours.
   * This was 30% of the total time.

4. Calculating the total time:
   * Let's call the total time "x".
   * We know that 6 hours (boating) + 3 hours (swimming) + 6 hours (shows) = 0.3x (30% of total time).
   * So, 15 hours = 0.3x
   * Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

5. Time spent sightseeing:
   * We know that sightseeing
