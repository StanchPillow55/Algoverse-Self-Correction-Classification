To solve this problem, we need to find the total time available for the performances and then calculate the number of groups that can perform within that time.

Given information:
- The concert duration is 2 hours (120 minutes).
- Each group is allowed 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage.
- There is a 10-minute intermission.

Step 1: Calculate the total time available for performances.
Total concert duration = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert duration - Time for intermission
Time available for performances = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time required for each group's performance.
Time for each group = Time to get on stage + Time to perform + Time to exit the stage
Time for each group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can perform in the concert.
Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The concert will be 2 hours long.
- Each group is allowed 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage.
- There will be a 10-minute intermission.

To find the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total time available for the performances and then divide it by the time required for each group.

Step 1: Calculate the total time available for the performances.
Total concert duration = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Total time available for performances = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time required for each group.
Time for each group = Time to get on stage + Time to perform + Time to exit the stage
Time for each group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can perform in the concert.
Number of groups = Total time available for performances
