Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The customer's loyalty card gives them $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend.
- On their last shopping trip, they spent $80.
- On this shopping trip, they spent $43, used their rewards, and applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

Step 1: Calculate the rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip.
Rewards earned = $80 / $20 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the amount the customer paid on this shopping trip after using the rewards.
Amount spent = $43
Rewards used = $4
Amount paid = $43 - $4 = $39

Step 3: Calculate the amount the coupon took off the price.
Coupon discount = 2 Ã— $4 = $8

Step 4: Calculate the final amount the customer paid on this shopping trip.
Final amount paid = $39 - $8 = $31

Therefore, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.
