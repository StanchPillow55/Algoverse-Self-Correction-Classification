Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dean has 30 marbles.
- He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie.
- He gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Step 1: Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie.
1/5 of 30 marbles = 30 รท 5 = 6 marbles

Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving 6 to Jamie.
Dean's remaining marbles = 30 - 6 = 24 marbles

Step 3: Calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving 10 to Donald.
Dean's remaining marbles = 24 - 10 = 14 marbles

Therefore, the number of marbles left for Dean is 14.

Final answer: Dean has 14 marbles left.
