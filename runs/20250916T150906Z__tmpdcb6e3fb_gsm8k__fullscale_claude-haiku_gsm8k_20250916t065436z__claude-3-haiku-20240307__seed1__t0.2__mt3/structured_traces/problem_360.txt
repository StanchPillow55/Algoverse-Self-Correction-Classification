To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for the age of Carver's son.

Given information:
- Carver just turned 45 years old.
- Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

Let's represent the age of Carver's son as x.

Step 1: Set up the equation.
Carver's age = 2 Ã— (Carver's son's age) - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
45 + 5 = 2x
50 = 2x
x = 25

Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.

Final answer: Carver's son is 25 years old.
