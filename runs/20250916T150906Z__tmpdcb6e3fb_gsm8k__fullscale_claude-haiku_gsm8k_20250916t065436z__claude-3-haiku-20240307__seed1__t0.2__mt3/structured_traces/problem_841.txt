To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the car and the phone, and then subtract the amount of money Gabriel has from working on weekends and the money his brother gave him.

Given information:
- The cost of the car is $10,000.
- The cost of the phone is $800.
- Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
- Gabriel's brother gave him $200 to help him.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.
Total cost = Cost of the car + Cost of the phone
Total cost = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has.
Total money = Money from working on weekends + Money from his brother
Total money = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Gabriel still needs.
Money still needed = Total cost - Total money
Money still needed = $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy the car and the phone.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000
- Gabriel wants to buy a phone for $800
- Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends
- Gabriel's brother gave him $200 to help him

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the car and phone.
Total cost = Cost of car + Cost of phone
Total cost = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has.
Money from working on weekends = $5,000
Money from brother = $200
Total money Gabriel has = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Gabriel still needs.
Money still needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money still needed = $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy the car and phone.

Final answer: Gabriel still needs $5,600.
