Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag.
- Comic books weigh 1/4 pound each.
- Toys weigh 1/2 pound each.
- Uriah removes 30 comic books.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the 30 comic books that Uriah removed.
Weight of 30 comic books = 30 × 1/4 pound = 7.5 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the remaining weight that Uriah needs to remove.
Total weight to be removed = 15 pounds
Weight of 30 comic books removed = 7.5 pounds
Remaining weight to be removed = 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys Uriah needs to remove.
Weight of each toy = 1/2 pound
Remaining weight to be removed = 7.5 pounds
Number of toys to be removed = Remaining weight to be removed / Weight of each toy
