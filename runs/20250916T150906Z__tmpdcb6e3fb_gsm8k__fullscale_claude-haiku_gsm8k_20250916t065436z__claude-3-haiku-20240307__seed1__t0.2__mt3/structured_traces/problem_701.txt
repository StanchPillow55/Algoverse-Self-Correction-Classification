To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people in the group, the total number of drinks and snacks they need to buy, and then calculate the total cost.

Given information:
- Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema.
- They meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema.
- Each seat can hold one person, two drinks, and three snacks.
- Drinks and snacks cost $2 each.

Step 1: Find the total number of people in the group.
Aiden and 12 of his friends + 7 more friends = 20 people

Step 2: Find the total number of drinks and snacks needed.
Each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks.
Total number of drinks = 20 people × 2 drinks per person = 40 drinks
Total number of snacks = 20 people × 3 snacks per person = 60 snacks

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.
Cost of drinks = 40 drinks × $2 per drink = $80
