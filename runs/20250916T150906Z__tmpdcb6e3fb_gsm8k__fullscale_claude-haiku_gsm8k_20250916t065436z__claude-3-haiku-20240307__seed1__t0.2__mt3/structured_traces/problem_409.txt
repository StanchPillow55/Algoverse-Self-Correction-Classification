To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June.

Given information:
- In May, the company hired 40 employees.
- Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May.
Number of employees in May = 40
Hourly rate = $15
Weekly hours = 40
Total pay per employee per week = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in May = $600 × 40 = $24,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in June.
Number of employees in June = 40 - (40 × 1/4) = 40 - 10 = 30
Hourly rate = $15
Weekly hours = 40
Total pay per employee per week = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in June = $600 × 30

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. In May, the company hired 40 employees, paying each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.
   * Total hours worked in May = 40 employees x 40 hours/week = 1,600 hours
   * Total pay in May = 1,600 hours x $15/hour = $24,000

2. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.
   * Number of employees whose contracts expired = 40 x 1/4 = 10 employees
   * Number of employees remaining = 40 - 10 = 30 employees
   * Total hours worked in June = 30 employees x 40 hours/week = 1,200 hours
   * Total pay in June = 1,200 hours x $15/hour = $18,000

3. Total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months:
   * Total pay in May + Total pay in June = $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,
