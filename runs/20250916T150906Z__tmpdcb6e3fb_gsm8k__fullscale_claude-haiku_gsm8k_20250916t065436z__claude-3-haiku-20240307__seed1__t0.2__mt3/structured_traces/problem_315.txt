Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each
- Martha invited 3 families with 4 people each
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness
- 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited to the party.
2 families with 6 people each = 2 × 6 = 12 people
3 families with 4 people each = 3 × 4 = 12 people
Total people invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who couldn't come due to illness.
Number of people who couldn't come due to illness = 8 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who had previous commitments.
1/4 of 8 people = 1/4 × 8 = 2 people

Step 4: Calculate the total number of people who didn't show up.
Number of people who didn't

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Martha invited:
   - 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people
   - 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people
   - Total invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
   - 24 people - 8 people = 16 people

3. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments.
   - 1/4 of 8 = 2 people
   - 16 people - 2 people = 14 people

Therefore, the final answer is that 14 people showed up for Martha's party.
