To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her friends and the additional random gifts.

Given information:
- Cherrie has 5 friends.
- 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
- 3 of her friends want 2 gifts each.
- Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.

Step 1: Calculate the number of gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each.
Number of gifts for 2 friends = 2 × 5 = 10 gifts

Step 2: Calculate the number of gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each.
Number of gifts for 3 friends = 3 × 2 = 6 gifts

Step 3: Calculate the total number of gifts for all 5 friends.
Total gifts for 5 friends = 10 gifts (for 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for 3 friends) = 16 gifts

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, including the additional 10

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
   * For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts.
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each.
   * For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts.
4. Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts to surprise her friends.

Now, let's add up the total number of gifts Cherrie bought:
* Gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each: 10 gifts
* Gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each: 6 gifts
* Additional 10 random gifts: 10 gifts

Total gifts bought = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26.
