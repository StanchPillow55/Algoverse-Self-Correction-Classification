Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first dog is an Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.
- The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
- The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
- The fourth dog is a Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the Dachshund.
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × Weight of Affenpinscher
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × 10 pounds = 20 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the Papillon.
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × Weight of Dachshund
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × 20 pounds = 5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the Mastiff.
Weight of Mastiff = 44

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first dog is an Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.

2. The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   * Dachshund's weight = 2 x 10 pounds = 20 pounds

3. The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   * Papillon's weight = 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds

4. The fourth dog is a Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   * Mastiff's weight = 44 x 5 pounds = 220 pounds

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.
