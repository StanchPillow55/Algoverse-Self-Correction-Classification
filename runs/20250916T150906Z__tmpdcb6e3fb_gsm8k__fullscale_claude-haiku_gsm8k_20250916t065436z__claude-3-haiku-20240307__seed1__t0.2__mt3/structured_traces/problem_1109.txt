To solve this problem, we need to find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party.

Given information:
- Three women are wearing 4-inch heels.
- Three women are wearing 2-inch heels.

Step 1: Calculate the total height of the heels.
Total height of heels = (3 × 4 inches) + (3 × 2 inches) = 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches

Step 2: Calculate the number of women at the party.
Number of women = 3 (wearing 4-inch heels) + 3 (wearing 2-inch heels) = 6 women

Step 3: Calculate the average height of the heels.
Average height of heels = Total height of heels / Number of women
Average height of heels = 18 inches / 6 women = 3 inches

Therefore, the average height of the heels at the cocktail party is 3 inches.
