Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grace weighs 125 pounds.
- Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs.

Step 1: Calculate how much Alex weighs.
Alex's weight = 4 × Grace's weight - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 4 × 125 pounds - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 500 pounds - 2 pounds
Alex's weight = 498 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of Grace and Alex.
Combined weight = Grace's weight + Alex's weight
Combined weight = 125 pounds + 498 pounds
Combined weight = 623 pounds

Therefore, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.
