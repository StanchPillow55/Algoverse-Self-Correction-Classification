To solve this problem, we need to keep track of Finley's position throughout the race and then determine the final place she finished in.

Given information:
- Finley started the race in first place.
- She fell back 5 spots.
- She then moved ahead 2 spots.
- She then fell behind 3 spots.
- Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.

Step 1: Determine Finley's position after falling back 5 spots.
Starting position: 1st place
Falling back 5 spots: 1st place - 5 = 6th place

Step 2: Determine Finley's position after moving ahead 2 spots.
Position after falling back: 6th place
Moving ahead 2 spots: 6th place - 2 = 4th place

Step 3: Determine Finley's position after falling behind 3 spots.
Position after moving ahead: 4th place
Falling behind 3 spots: 4th place + 3 = 7th place

Step 4: Determine Finley

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Finley started off in first place.

2. She then fell back 5 spots. 
   * If she started in 1st place and fell back 5 spots, that means she is now in 6th place.

3. She then moved ahead 2 spots.
   * If she was in 6th place and moved ahead 2 spots, that means she is now in 4th place.

4. She then fell behind 3 spots.
   * If she was in 4th place and fell behind 3 spots, that means she is now in 7th place.

5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.
   * If she was in 7th place and jumped ahead 1 spot, that means she finished the race in 6th place.

Therefore, the final place Finley finished the 100-meter race in is 6th place.
