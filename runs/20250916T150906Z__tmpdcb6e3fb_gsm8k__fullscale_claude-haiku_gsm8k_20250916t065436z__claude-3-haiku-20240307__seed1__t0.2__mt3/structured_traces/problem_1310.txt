To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

Given information:
- Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Step 1: Find the distance Aaron ran.
Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can divide Vanessa's distance by 2 to find Aaron's distance.
Aaron's distance = Vanessa's distance / 2
Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles

Step 2: Find the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile.
Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles.
Time to run 1 mile = Total time / Total distance
Time to run 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

Step 3: Find the time it took Vanessa to run 1

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Step 1: Find Aaron's speed.
Since Aaron can run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, we can say that Aaron's speed is 2 times Vanessa's speed.
Let's call Vanessa's speed "x" miles per minute.
Then, Aaron's speed = 2x miles per minute.

Step 2: Find the distance Aaron ran.
We know that Vanessa ran 4 miles, and she can run twice as far as Aaron.
Therefore, Aaron ran 2 miles.

Step 3: Find the time it took Aaron to run 2 miles.
We know that Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.
Therefore, Aaron's speed = 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.
