To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad, and then add them together to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

Given information:
- 16 people are invited to the birthday party.
- 10 people want the chicken salad, which costs $6.50 per person.
- 6 people want the pasta salad, which costs $6 per person.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chicken salad.
Total cost of chicken salad = Number of people ordering chicken salad × Cost per person
Total cost of chicken salad = 10 × $6.50 = $65

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pasta salad.
Total cost of pasta salad = Number of people ordering pasta salad × Cost per person
Total cost of pasta salad = 6 × $6 = $36

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.
Total amount Molly will pay = Total cost of chicken salad + Total cost of pasta salad
Total amount Molly will

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Molly invited 16 people to the birthday party.
- 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 per person.
- 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chicken salad.
Cost of chicken salad = Number of people x Price per person
Cost of chicken salad = 10 x $6.50 = $65

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pasta salad.
Cost of pasta salad = Number of people x Price per person
Cost of pasta salad = 6 x $6 = $36

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the catering.
Total cost = Cost of chicken salad + Cost of pasta salad
Total cost = $65 + $36 = $101

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.
