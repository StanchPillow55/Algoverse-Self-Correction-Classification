To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.

Given information:
- Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
- She collects one shell every month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of months between Martha's 5th birthday and her 10th birthday.
Number of years between 5th and 10th birthday = 10 - 5 = 5 years
Number of months between 5th and 10th birthday = 5 years Ã— 12 months/year = 60 months

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.
Total number of shells collected = Number of months between 5th and 10th birthday
Total number of shells collected = 60 shells

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

Final answer: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
2. She collects one shell every month.
3. We need to find how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

To calculate this, we need to find the number of months between when she started collecting (age 5) and her 10th birthday.

* Age 5 to age 10 is 5 years
* 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Final answer: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
2. Every month, she collects one shell.
3. We need to find out how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

To calculate this, we need to find the total number of months between when she started collecting (age 5) and her 10th birthday.

* From age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years.
* Each year has 12 months.
* So, the total number of months is 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is:

* 60 months x 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.
