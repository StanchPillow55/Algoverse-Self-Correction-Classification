Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
- James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu.

Step 1: Calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu.
Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, we can calculate this as:
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × 66 = 22 messages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of messages James delivers.
Total messages = Messages to Ms. Thompson + Messages to Mr. Yu
Total messages = 66 + 22 = 88 messages

Therefore, the total number of messages James delivers is 88.

Final answer: James delivers a total of 88 messages.
