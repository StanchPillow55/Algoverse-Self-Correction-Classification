Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
2. He likes to double that amount, so he uses 4 pounds of onions.
3. The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound.
4. So the cost of the onions is:
   * 4 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $8.00

5. The recipe also requires 2 boxes of beef stock.
6. The beef stock is on sale for $2.00 per box.
7. So the cost of the beef stock is:
   * 2 boxes x $2.00 per box = $4.00

8. The total cost of the ingredients is:
   * $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00

9. The recipe serves 6 people.
10. To calculate the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
    * $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00
