To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Each child plants one tree.
- Each teacher plants two trees.
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students and 3 teachers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Total number of students = Number of classes × Average number of students per class
Total number of students = 40 × 25 = 1,000 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the students.
Total number of trees planted by students = Total number of students
Total number of trees planted by students = 1,000 trees

Step 3: Calculate the total number of teachers.
Total number of teachers = Number of classes × Average number of teachers per class
Total number of teachers = 40 × 3 = 120 teachers

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
Total number of trees planted by teachers = Total number of teachers × 2 trees per teacher
Total number of trees plante

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The school has 40 classes.
2. Each class has an average of 25 students.
3. Each class has 3 teachers.

To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to find the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then add them together.

Trees planted by students:
* Each student plants 1 tree.
* There are 25 students per class.
* There are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of trees planted by students is:
   * 25 students per class x 40 classes = 1,000 trees

Trees planted by teachers:
* Each teacher plants 2 trees.
* There are 3 teachers per class.
* There are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:
   * 2 trees per teacher x 3 teachers per class x 40 classes = 240 trees

Total trees planted:
* Trees planted by students (1,000) + Trees planted by teachers (

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Each child plants 1 tree.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Each class has 3 teachers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Number of students per class × Number of classes = Total number of students
25 students × 40 classes = 1,000 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of teachers.
Number of teachers per class × Number of classes = Total number of teachers
3 teachers × 40 classes = 120 teachers

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the students.
Number of students × 1 tree per student = Total trees planted by students
1,000 students × 1 tree = 1,000 trees

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
Number of teachers × 2 trees per teacher = Total trees planted by teachers
120 teachers × 2 trees = 240
