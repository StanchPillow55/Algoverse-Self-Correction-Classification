To solve this problem, we need to find the number of teachers who were at school on that day.

Given information:
- There are 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School.
- 13 of the 82 teachers were sick.
- 9 substitute teachers were called in to help.

Step 1: Find the number of teachers who were not sick.
Total teachers - Sick teachers = Teachers not sick
82 - 13 = 69 teachers

Step 2: Find the total number of teachers at school that day.
Teachers not sick + Substitute teachers = Total teachers at school
69 + 9 = 78 teachers

Therefore, there were 78 teachers at school that day.

Final answer: 78 teachers were at school that day.
