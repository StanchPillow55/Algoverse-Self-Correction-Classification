To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the given information to find the original weight of the triceratops.

Given information:
- The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops.
- The pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
- The group of Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Let's represent the original weight of the triceratops as "x" kilograms.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the triceratops after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of it.
Weight of the triceratops after the T-Rex ate = x/2 kilograms

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the triceratops after the pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
Weight of the triceratops after the velociraptors scavenged = (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms

Step 3: The group of Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops.
   * Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops 'x' kilograms.
   * The T-Rex ate half of 'x', which is x/2 kilograms.

2) The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
   * After the T-Rex ate, there was x/2 kilograms left.
   * The velociraptors ate half of that, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms.

3) The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   * The amount of meat left after the velociraptors was x/2 - x/4 = x/4 kilograms.
   * Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we can say that x/4 = 270.

4) Solving for the original amount 'x':
   * x/4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops it had hunted.
   * This means the T-Rex ate 50% of the total meat on the triceratops.

2) After the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
   * This means the velociraptors ate 50% of the remaining 50% of the meat.
   * So the velociraptors ate 25% of the total meat.

3) A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   * This tells us that the remaining 25% of the meat was 270 kilograms.

Now let's work backwards to find the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate:

* The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, which was 25% of the total.
* To find the total, we divide 270 kg by 0.25 (25% expressed as a decimal):
