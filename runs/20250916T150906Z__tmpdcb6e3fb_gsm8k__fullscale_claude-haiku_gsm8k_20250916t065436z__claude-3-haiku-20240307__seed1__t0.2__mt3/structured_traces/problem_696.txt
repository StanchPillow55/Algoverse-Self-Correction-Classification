Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of points collected by Betty.
Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points
Betty's points = 50 + (0.3 × 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

Step 2: Calculate the number of points collected by Tom.
Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
Tom's points = 65 - 30 = 35 points

Step 3: Calculate the number of points collected by Martha.
Martha's points = 3 × Tom's points
Martha's points = 3 × 35 = 105 points

Step 4: Calculate the total points collected by the class.
Total points collected = Adam's points +

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Adam has collected 50 points.
2. Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so her points are:
   * 50 + (50 * 0.3) = 50 + 15 = 65 points

3. Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so her points are:
   * 3 * Tom's points

4. Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so his points are:
   * 65 - 30 = 35 points

5. Martha's points are:
   * 3 * 35 = 105 points

6. The total points collected by the class are:
   * Adam: 50 points
   * Betty: 65 points
   * Martha: 105 points
   * Tom: 35 points
   * Total: 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points

7. The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.
8. The class is missing:
