Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills.
- Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has.
- Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.
4 $10 bills = 4 × $10 = $40
6 $20 bills = 6 × $20 = $120
Total amount of money = $40 + $120 = $160

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister.
Amount of money given to his sister = 1/2 × $160 = $80

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving half to his sister.
Remaining amount of money = $160 - $80 = $80

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner.
Amount of money used to buy dinner = 3/5 × $80 = $48

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Ali
