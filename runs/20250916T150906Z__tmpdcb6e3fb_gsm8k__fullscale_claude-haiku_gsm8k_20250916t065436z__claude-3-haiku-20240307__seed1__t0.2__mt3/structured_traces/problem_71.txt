To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes.

Given information:
- The first recipe has 20 instructions.
- The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one.

Step 1: Find the number of instructions in the second recipe.
Number of instructions in the second recipe = 2 × Number of instructions in the first recipe
Number of instructions in the second recipe = 2 × 20 = 40 instructions

Step 2: Find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes.
Total number of instructions = Number of instructions in the first recipe + Number of instructions in the second recipe
Total number of instructions = 20 + 40 = 60 instructions

Therefore, Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

Final answer: Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.
