Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dax found half as many bugs as ants in the garden.
- There were 50 ants in the garden.

Step 1: Find the number of bugs in the garden.
Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
Number of bugs = 1/2 × Number of ants
Number of bugs = 1/2 × 50 = 25 bugs

Step 2: Find the total number of insects in the garden.
Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25 = 75 insects

Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.

Final answer: The total number of insects in the garden is 75.
