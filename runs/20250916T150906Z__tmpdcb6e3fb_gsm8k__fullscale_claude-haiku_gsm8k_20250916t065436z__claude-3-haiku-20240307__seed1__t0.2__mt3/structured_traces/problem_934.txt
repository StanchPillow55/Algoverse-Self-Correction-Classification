To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance spat by each person and then calculate the average of the total distances.

Given information:
- Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet.
- Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.
Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Zoey's total distance = 40 × 10 feet = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate the total distance spat by Sydney.
Sydney's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Sydney's total distance = 35 × 12 feet = 420 feet

Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.
Average total distance = (Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance) / 2
Average total distance = (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet

Therefore, the average total distance spat is

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet.
- Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet.

Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance spat.
Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Zoey's total distance = 40 × 10 feet = 400 feet

Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance spat.
Sydney's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Sydney's total distance = 35 × 12 feet = 420 feet

Step 3: Calculate the total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney.
Total distance spat = Zoey's total distance + Sydney's total distance
Total distance spat = 400 feet + 420 feet = 820 feet

Step 4: Calculate the average total distance spat.
Average total distance = Total distance spat / (Number of participants)
Average total distance = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet
