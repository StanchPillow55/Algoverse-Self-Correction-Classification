To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of slices of cheese used by Carl throughout the week.

Given information:
- Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
- Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
- Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Step 1: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the sandwiches.
Number of sandwiches per week = 7 (one per day)
Slices of cheese per sandwich = 2
Slices of cheese used for sandwiches = 7 × 2 = 14 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the omelets.
Number of omelets per week = 3 (3 days)
Slices of cheese per omelet = 2 + 1 = 3 (one more than per sandwich)
Slices of cheese used for ome

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cheese used for sandwiches:
   * Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, which is 7 days.
   * He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   * So, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     * 7 days x 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese

2. Cheese used for omelets:
   * Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   * He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 3 slices.
   * So, the total cheese used for omelets is:
     * 3 days x 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices of cheese

3. Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:
   * Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners for the week.
   * He used 8 slices of cheese in the dish.

4. Total cheese used:
