To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour to get the total cost.

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The cost of each session is $125 per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
Number of weeks × Number of sessions per week × Number of hours per session = Total number of hours
6 weeks × 2 sessions per week × 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy.
Total number of hours × Cost per hour = Total cost
24 hours × $125 per hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy was $3,000.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The sessions cost $125 per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
Number of sessions per week = 2 times
Number of hours per session = 2 hours
Number of weeks = 6 weeks
Total number of hours = 2 sessions/week × 2 hours/session × 6 weeks = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy sessions.
Cost per hour = $125
Total cost = Total number of hours × Cost per hour
Total cost = 24 hours × $125/hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy sessions was $3,000.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The sessions cost $125 per hour.

To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours of physical therapy.
Number of weeks = 6
Number of sessions per week = 2
Number of hours per session = 2
Total number of hours = 6 weeks × 2 sessions per week × 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy.
Cost per hour = $125
Total cost = Total number of hours × Cost per hour
Total cost = 24 hours × $125 per hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy for John was $3,000.
