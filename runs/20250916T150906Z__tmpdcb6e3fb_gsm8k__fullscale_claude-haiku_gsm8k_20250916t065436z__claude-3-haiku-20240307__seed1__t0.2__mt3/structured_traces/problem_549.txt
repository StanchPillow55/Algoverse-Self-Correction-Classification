To solve this problem, we need to find the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

Step 1: Find the number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set.
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × Size of James's play set
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Find the number of toys Jonathan needs to add to his current collection.
Number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set = 400 toys
Number of toys Jonathan currently has = x
Number of toys Jonathan needs to add = 400 - x + 2

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
Number of toys Jonathan needs to add = 2
400 - x + 2 = 2
400 - x = 0
x = 400

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 400 toys.

Final answer: Jonathan currently has 400

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

Step 1: Determine the size of the play set that Jonathan needs to create.
Since Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger than James's play set, we can calculate the size of Jonathan's play set as follows:
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs to have in order to create the play set.
Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so the total number of toys he needs is:
Total toys needed = 400 + 2 = 402 toys

Step 3: Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has.
Since Jonathan needs 402 toys in total, and he needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can calculate the number

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the size of the play set that Jonathan needs to make.
Size of James's play set = 80 toys
Size of Jonathan's play set needs to be 5 times larger than James's play set.
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs to have in total.
Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys for the play set.
Total toys Jonathan needs = 400 + 2 = 402 toys

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
Total toys Jonathan needs = 402 toys
We know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so:
Jonathan's current number of toys
