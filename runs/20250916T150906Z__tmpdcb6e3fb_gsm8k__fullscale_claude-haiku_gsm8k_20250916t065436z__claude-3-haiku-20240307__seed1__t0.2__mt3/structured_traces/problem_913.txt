Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of yellow balloons

We know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, so we can set up an equation:
2(20) + 3x = 58

Explanation:
- 2(20) represents the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the 20 red balloons (2 pieces per red balloon)
- 3x represents the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the x yellow balloons (3 pieces per yellow balloon)
- The sum of these two terms equals the total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown

Now, let's solve the equation for x:
2(20) + 3x

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons.
Number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per red balloon × 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons.
Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58 pieces
Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40 pieces
Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = Total pieces - Pieces at red balloons
Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = 58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons.
Pieces of bologna per yellow balloon = 3 pieces
Number of yellow balloons = Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow ball

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons
2. Subtract the total pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total 58 pieces
3. Divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon to get the number of yellow balloons

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons
Total pieces thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per red balloon × 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Subtract the total pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total 58 pieces
Remaining pieces = 58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Step 3: Divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces
