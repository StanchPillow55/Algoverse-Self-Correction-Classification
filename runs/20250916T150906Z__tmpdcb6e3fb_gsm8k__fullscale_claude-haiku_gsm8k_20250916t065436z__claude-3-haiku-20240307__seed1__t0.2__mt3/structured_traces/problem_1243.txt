Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each bag of beef jerky contains 30 sticks.
- The regular price of a bag is $18.00.
- Archie buys 1 bag while it's $3.00 off the regular price.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the bag.
Regular price of the bag = $18.00
Discount on the bag = $3.00
Discounted price of the bag = $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost per stick of jerky.
Number of sticks per bag = 30
Discounted price of the bag = $15.00
Cost per stick of jerky = Discounted price of the bag / Number of sticks per bag
Cost per stick of jerky = $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick to cents.
Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 Ã— 100 = 50 cents per stick

Therefore, the cost

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original price of the beef jerky bag is $18.00.
2. The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky.
3. Archie buys the bag while it's $3.00 off, so the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Now, to find the cost per stick of jerky:
* Cost per bag = $15.00
* Number of sticks per bag = 30
* Cost per stick = $15.00 / 30 = $0.50

To convert this to cents:
* $0.50 = 50 cents

Therefore, the cost of each stick of jerky is 50 cents.

Final answer: 50 cents per stick of beef jerky.
