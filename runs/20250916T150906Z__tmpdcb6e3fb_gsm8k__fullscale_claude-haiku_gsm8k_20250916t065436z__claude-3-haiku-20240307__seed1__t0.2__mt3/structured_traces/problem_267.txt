To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
- It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
- After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees.
Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees = 20 minutes + (20 minutes Ã— 0.4) = 28 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time to warm up the oil.
Total time to warm up the oil = 20 minutes + 28 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken.
Time to cook the chicken = 48 minutes - 5 minutes = 43 minutes

Therefore, the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is 48 minutes + 43 minutes =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.

2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
   * 40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   * So the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   * Warming the oil took 28 minutes.
   * So the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time:
* Heating the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
* Heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 8 minutes
* Cooking time: 23 minutes
* Total time: 20 + 8 + 23 =
