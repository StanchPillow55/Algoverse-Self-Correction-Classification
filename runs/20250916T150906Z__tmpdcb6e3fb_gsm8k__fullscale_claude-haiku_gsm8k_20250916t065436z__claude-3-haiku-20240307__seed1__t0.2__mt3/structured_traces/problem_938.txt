Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.
- He spent $50 on gas.
- He wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
- He wants to buy 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
- He wants to buy 25-dollar pens after buying the pencils.

Step 1: Calculate John's total earnings for the week.
Total earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked
Total earnings = $50 × 6 hours = $300

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money John has after buying gas and depositing $100 in the bank.
Amount of money left = Total earnings - Gas cost - Bank deposit
Amount of money left = $300 - $50 - $100 = $150

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the 5 pencils.
Cost of 5 pencils = 5 × $10 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money John has left after buying the pencils.
Amount of money left = Amount of

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.
   * Total earnings = $50 x 6 hours = $300

2. John spent $50 on gas.
   * Remaining money = $300 - $50 = $250

3. John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   * Remaining money after deposit = $250 - $100 = $150

4. John bought 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
   * Cost of pencils = 5 x $10 = $50
   * Remaining money = $150 - $50 = $100

5. Now, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens.
   * Remaining money = $100
   * Number of 25 dollar pens he can buy = $100 / $25 = 4 pens

Therefore, the final answer is that John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils.

   * Total earnings = $50 per hour x 6 hours = $300

2. John spent $50 on gas.
   * Remaining money = $300 - $50 = $250

3. John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   * Money left after deposit = $250 - $100 = $150

4. John bought 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
   * Cost of pencils = 5 x $10 = $50
   * Money left after buying pencils = $150 - $50 = $100

5. John wants to buy 25 dollar pens.
   * Money left after buying pencils = $100
   * Cost of each pen = $25
   * Number of pens he can buy = $100 / $25 = 4 pens
