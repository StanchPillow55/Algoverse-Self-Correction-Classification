To solve this problem, we need to find the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything.

Given information:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- There are 32 kids in the class.

Step 1: Find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts.
Kids allergic to dairy = 9
Kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts = 3
Total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12

Step 2: Find the number of kids who are not allergic to anything.
Total number of kids in the class = 32
Number of kids who are not allergic to anything = Total number of kids - Total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts
Number of kids who are not allergic to anything = 32 - 12 = 20
