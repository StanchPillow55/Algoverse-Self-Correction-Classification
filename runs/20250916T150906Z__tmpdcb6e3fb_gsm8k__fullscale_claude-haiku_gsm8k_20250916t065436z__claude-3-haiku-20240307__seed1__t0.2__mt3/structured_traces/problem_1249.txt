To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of candles and flashlights used by Brianna's family when the lights go out.

Given information:
- There are 8 rooms in the house.
- There are 4 people living in the house, including Brianna.
- There is a flashlight for every person to carry and two for each room.
- There are 4 small candles for each of the half the rooms and 5 medium candles for each of the other half of the rooms.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flashlights used.
Number of people × 1 flashlight per person = 4 × 1 = 4 flashlights
Number of rooms × 2 flashlights per room = 8 × 2 = 16 flashlights
Total number of flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights

Step 2: Calculate the total number of small candles used.
Number of rooms with small candles = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 rooms

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 8 rooms in the house
- There are 4 people living in the house, including Brianna
- There is a flashlight for every person to carry
- There are 2 flashlights for each room
- Half the rooms have 4 small candles each
- The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flashlights
Number of people × 1 flashlight per person = 4 flashlights
Number of rooms × 2 flashlights per room = 16 flashlights
Total number of flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights

Step 2: Calculate the total number of small candles
Number of rooms with small candles × 4 small candles per room = 4 × 4 = 16 small candles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of medium candles
Number of rooms with medium candles × 5 medium candles per room = 4 × 5
