To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of raspberries on the bush.

Given information:
- The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each.
- The raspberry bush has 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters.
Number of clusters × Number of fruit per cluster = Total number of fruit in clusters
6 × 20 = 120 raspberries

Step 2: Add the number of individual fruit scattered across the bush.
Total number of fruit in clusters + Number of individual fruit = Total number of raspberries
120 + 67 = 187 raspberries

Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is 187.

Final answer: There are 187 raspberries in total on the bush.
