Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
- Yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00.
- We need to find how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Number of yogurts per day = 2
Number of days = 30
Total number of yogurts in 30 days = 2 yogurts/day × 30 days = 60 yogurts

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 60 yogurts at the sale price.
Cost of 4 yogurts = $5.00
Cost of 1 yogurt = $5.00 / 4 = $1.25
Cost of 60 yogurts = 60 yogurts × $1.25/yogurt = $75.00

Therefore, Terry will spend $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Final answer: Terry will spend $75

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
2. The yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00.
3. We need to find how much he spends on yogurt over 30 days.

First, let's calculate how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
* 2 yogurts per day x 30 days = 60 yogurts

Now, let's calculate the cost of 60 yogurts at the sale price of 4 for $5.00:
* 60 yogurts / 4 yogurts per $5.00 = 15 sets of 4 yogurts
* 15 sets x $5.00 per set = $75.00

Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is $75.00.
