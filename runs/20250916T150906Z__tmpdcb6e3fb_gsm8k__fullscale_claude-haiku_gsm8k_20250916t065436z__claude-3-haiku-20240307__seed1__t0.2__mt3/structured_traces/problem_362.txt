Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds.
Stuffing needed for 1 chihuahua bed = 2 pounds
Stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 Ã— 2 pounds = 8 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed.
Average stuffing = (Rottweiler bed + chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the collie

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   * The average of 8 pounds (Rottweiler) and 2 pounds (chihuahua) is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.
4. Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.
   * For the 4 chihuahua beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
   * For the 3 collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.
5. The total amount of stuffing Mark needs is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is that Mark needs 23
