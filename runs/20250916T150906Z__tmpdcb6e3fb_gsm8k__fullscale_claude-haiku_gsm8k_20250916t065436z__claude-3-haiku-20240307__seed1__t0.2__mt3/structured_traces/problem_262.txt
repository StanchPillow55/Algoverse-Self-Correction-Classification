Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box.
- Maddison gets 20 marbles from her friend.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Maddison has in the 5 boxes.
Number of marbles in each box = 50
Number of boxes = 5
Total number of marbles in the 5 boxes = 50 Ã— 5 = 250 marbles

Step 2: Add the 20 marbles Maddison got from her friend.
Total number of marbles = Marbles in the 5 boxes + Marbles from friend
Total number of marbles = 250 + 20 = 270 marbles

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

Final answer: Maddison has 270 marbles.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box.
   * To find the total number of marbles in the 5 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:
   * 5 boxes x 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

2. Maddison then gets 20 marbles from her friend.
   * To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the 20 marbles from her friend to the 250 marbles she already had:
   * 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Therefore, the final answer is that Maddison now has 270 marbles.
