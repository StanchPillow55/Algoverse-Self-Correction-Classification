To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days.

Given information:
- Sunflower cost: $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers cost: $8
- Earnings from sunflowers per day: $26
- Earnings from bouquets per day: $56
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
Earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of each sunflower = Number of sunflowers sold per day
$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers sold per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
Earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of each bouquet = Number of bouquets sold per day
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets sold per day

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.
Number of bouquets sold per day × Number of sunflowers per bouquet = Number of sunflowers

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sunflower costs $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers costs $8
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
Sunflowers sold per day = Earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of each sunflower
Sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
Bouquets sold per day = Earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of each bouquet
Bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.
Total sunflowers sold = (Sunflowers sold per day × 3 days) + (Bouquets sold per day × 12

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sunflower costs $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers costs $8
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
Sunflower revenue per day = $26
Sunflower price per unit = $2
Number of sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
Bouquet revenue per day = $56
Bouquet price per unit = $8
Number of bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.
Sunflowers per bouquet = 12
Bouquets sold per day = 7
Sunflowers in bouquets sold per day =
