To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks.

Given information:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day.
- The duration is three weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cows after three weeks.
Initial number of cows = 50
Number of cows added per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 21 (3 weeks × 7 days per week)
Total number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows per day × 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows on the farm after three weeks = Initial number of cows + Total number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Step 2: Calculate the number of chickens after three weeks.
Initial number of chickens = 20
Number of chickens added per

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial number of animals on the farm:
   - 50 cows
   - 20 chickens
   - Total: 50 + 20 = 70 animals

2. Additions to the farm over 3 weeks:
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day
   - Over 3 weeks (21 days), the total additions are:
     - Cows: 20 cows/day x 21 days = 420 cows
     - Chickens: 10 chickens/day x 21 days = 210 chickens

3. Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks:
   - Initial animals: 70
   - Cows added: 420
   - Chickens added: 210
   - Total: 70 + 420 + 210 = 700 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.
