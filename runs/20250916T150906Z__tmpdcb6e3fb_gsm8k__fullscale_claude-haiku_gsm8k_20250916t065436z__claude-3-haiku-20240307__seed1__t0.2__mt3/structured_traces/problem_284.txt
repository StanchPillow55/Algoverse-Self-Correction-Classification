Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stories written in the second week.
Alani's stories in the second week = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
Braylen's stories in the second week = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
Margot's stories in the second week = 60 × 2 = 120 stories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stories written in both weeks.
Total stories written in the first week:
Alani: 20 stories
Braylen: 40 stories
Margot: 60 stories
Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

Total stories written in the second week:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stories written by each person in the second week.
Alani's stories in the second week = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
Braylen's stories in the second week = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
Margot's stories in the second week = 60 × 2 = 120 stories
