To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples Lucy picked over the three days.

Given information:
- Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and got $56.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday.
Since Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can divide the total amount by the price per apple to find the number of apples.
Number of apples picked on Monday = $56 / $4 per apple = 14 apples

Step 2: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Tuesday.
We know that Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

Step 3: Find the number of apples Lucy picked on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.
Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 × 12 = 24 apples

Step 4: Calculate the total

Given information:
- Lucy sells apples for $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and got $56.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples from the previous day.
