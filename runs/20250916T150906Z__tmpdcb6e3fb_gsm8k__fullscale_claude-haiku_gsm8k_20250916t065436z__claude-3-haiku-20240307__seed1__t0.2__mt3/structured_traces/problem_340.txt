Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Josh starts off practicing juggling 3 balls.
- He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week.
- After 4 weeks, the talent show begins.
- When Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls.
- 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd.
- 1 ball gets lost completely.

Step 1: Calculate the number of balls Josh is juggling after 4 weeks.
Starting with 3 balls, and adding 1 ball each week, the number of balls Josh is juggling after 4 weeks is:
3 balls + (1 ball Ã— 4 weeks) = 7 balls

Step 2: Calculate the number of balls Josh has left after dropping 3 balls on stage.
Josh started with 7 balls, and dropped 3 balls.
7 balls - 3 balls = 4 balls

Step 3: Calculate the number of balls Josh has left after 2 of the dropped balls are caught by the crowd.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josh starts off practicing juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
   * Week 1: 3 balls
   * Week 2: 4 balls
   * Week 3: 5 balls
   * Week 4: 6 balls

3. At the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins.
4. When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.
5. 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage.
6. 1 ball gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

So, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle on stage is:
* Total balls before dropping: 6
* Balls dropped: 3
* Balls caught by the crowd: 2
* Balls lost: 1

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has to juggle on stage is:
* 6 - 3 + 2 = 5
