To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day.

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the usual sleeping time.
Usual sleeping time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time she woke up earlier.
Time she woke up earlier = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Step 3: Calculate the time she was actually sleeping on her bed.
Time she was sleeping on her bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 4: Subtract the time she was sleepwalking.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kim usually sleeps.
Usual sleep time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time Kim actually slept on the bed that day.
Usual wake up time = 6 a.m.
Actual wake up time = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
Time spent sleeping on the bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the time Kim was sleepwalking from the total time

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- One day, she woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
- That day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.

To find the total minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

Step 1: Calculate the usual sleep duration.
Usual sleep duration = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours = 480 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time she was awake due to sleepwalking.
Time awake due to sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time she was awake due to waking up 5
