To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of water balloons the girls had after Maria's mom gave them additional balloons.

Given information:
- Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight.
- At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons.
- Maria had one water balloon for herself.
- Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of water balloons the girls had at the start of the game.
Number of balloons for Maria's friends = 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons
Number of balloons for Maria = 1 balloon
Total number of balloons at the start of the game = 8 + 1 = 9 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional balloons Maria's mom gave to each person.
Number of additional balloons for each person = 3 balloons
Total number of additional balloons = 5 people (4 friends + Maria) × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons each.
   * 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
   * 1 balloon for Maria

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.
   * 4 friends x 3 balloons each = 12 balloons
   * 1 balloon for Maria

4. To calculate the total number of balloons:
   * Balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 = 9
   * Balloons given by Maria's mom: 12
   * Total balloons: 9 + 12 = 21

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 21.

   * 1 balloon for Maria

4. To calculate the total number of balloons:
   * Balloons given by Maria initially: 8
   * Balloon for Maria initially: 1
   * Balloons given by Maria's mom: 12
   * Total balloons = 8 + 1 + 12 = 21

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 21.
