Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Skipping rope costs $6
- Board game costs $11
- Playground ball costs $2
- Dora has saved $2 from her allowance
- Dora's mother gave her $16

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.
Total cost = Cost of skipping rope + Cost of board game + Cost of playground ball
Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Dora has.
Total money = Money saved from allowance + Money given by mother
Total money = $2 + $16 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Dora still needs to buy the items.
Amount of money needed = Total cost - Total money
Amount of money needed = $19 - $18 = $1

Therefore, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball.

Final answer: Dora needs $1 more to buy the sk
