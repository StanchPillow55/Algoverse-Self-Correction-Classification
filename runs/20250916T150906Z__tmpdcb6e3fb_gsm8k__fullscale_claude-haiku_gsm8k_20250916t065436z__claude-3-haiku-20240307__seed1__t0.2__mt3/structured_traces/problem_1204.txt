To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team The finders' findings.
5. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
Total shells found = 700
Alphas found 40% of the shells
Shells found by Alphas = 700 × 0.40 = 280 shells

Step 2: Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
Shells remaining = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
Shells remaining = 700 - 280 = 420 shells

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
The finders found 60% of the remaining shells
Shells found by The finders = 420 × 0.60 = 252 shells

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Total number of shells found: 700

2. Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:
   * 40% of 700 = 0.40 x 700 = 280 shells

3. Remaining shells after Team Alphas:
   * 700 - 280 = 420 shells

4. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
   * 60% of 420 = 0.60 x 420 = 252 shells

5. Remaining shells after Team The finders:
   * 420 - 252 = 168 shells

6. Therefore, the number of shells found by Team Gogetters is:
   * 168 shells

Final answer: Team Gogetters found 168 shells.
