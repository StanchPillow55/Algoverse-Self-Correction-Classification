To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cars Josh services in 2 weeks and then calculate his total earnings.

Given information:
- Josh services 3 cars a day.
- He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
- He gets paid $4 per car.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
Number of days open in a week = 7 days - 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 days

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Josh services in a week.
Number of cars serviced per day = 3 cars
Number of cars serviced in a week = 3 cars × 5 days = 15 cars

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars Josh services in 2 weeks.
Number of cars serviced in 2 weeks = 15 cars × 2 weeks = 30 cars

Step 4: Calculate Josh's total earnings in 2 weeks.
Earnings per car = $4
Total earnings in 2 weeks = 30 cars × $4 per car =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josh services 3 cars per day.
2. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
   * That means he is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).
3. He gets paid $4 per car.

To calculate his earnings in 2 weeks, we need to:
* Calculate his daily earnings
* Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he is open in 2 weeks

Daily earnings:
* 3 cars per day x $4 per car = $12 per day

Days open in 2 weeks:
* 5 days per week x 2 weeks = 10 days

Total earnings in 2 weeks:
* $12 per day x 10 days = $120

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.
