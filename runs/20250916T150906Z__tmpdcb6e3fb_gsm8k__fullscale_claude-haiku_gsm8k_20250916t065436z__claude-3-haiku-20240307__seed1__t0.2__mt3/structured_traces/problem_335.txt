Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers.
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge.
- Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for the 8 batches of suckers.
Sugar needed for 1 batch of suckers = 30 ounces
Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers = 8 Ã— 30 ounces = 240 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for the 1 batch of fudge.
Sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge = 70 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sugar needed for all the batches.
Total sugar needed = Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers + Sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge
Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make 1 batch of suckers.
2. He needs to make 8 batches of suckers.
3. To calculate the total sugar needed for the 8 batches of suckers, we multiply 30 ounces by 8:
   * 30 ounces x 8 = 240 ounces of sugar

4. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make 1 batch of fudge.
5. He needs to make 1 batch of fudge.
6. So the sugar needed for the 1 batch of fudge is 70 ounces.

7. To find the total sugar needed, we add the sugar for the suckers and the fudge:
   * 240 ounces + 70 ounces = 310 ounces of sugar

Therefore, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is 310 oun
