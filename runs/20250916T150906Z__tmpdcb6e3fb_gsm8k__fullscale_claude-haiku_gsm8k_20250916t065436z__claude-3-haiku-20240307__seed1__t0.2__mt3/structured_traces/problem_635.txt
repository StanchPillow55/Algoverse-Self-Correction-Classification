To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per class.
Cost per class = Total cost / Total number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10 = $6 per class

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.
Since the cost per class is $6, and the maximum cost per class is $10, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Explanation:
If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $6.
If Manny misses 1 class, the cost per class would be $60 / 9 = $6.67, which is still less than $10.
If Manny misses 2 classes,

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum total cost of the classes that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum total cost = $10 per class × 10 classes = $100

Step 2: Calculate the cost per class that Manny's parents will allow.
Cost per class = $100 / 10 classes = $10 per class

Step 3: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.
If Manny misses x classes, the total cost will be $60 for the remaining (10 - x) classes.
Total cost = $60
Cost per class = $60 / (10 - x)

We know the cost per class must be less than or equal to $10, so:
$60 / (10 - x) ≤ $10

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum cost per class that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum cost per class = $10

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the 10 classes.
Total cost of 10 classes = $60

Step 3: Calculate the maximum total cost that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum total cost = Maximum cost per class × Number of classes
Maximum total cost = $10 × 10 = $100

Step 4: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.
Since the total cost of the 10 classes is $60, and the maximum total cost that Manny's parents will allow is $100, the difference is $40.
Number of classes Manny can miss = Difference in total cost / Maximum cost per class
Number of classes
