To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature inside the house during the night and then determine how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature above 32 degrees.

Given information:
- The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
- Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees.
- It was 45 degrees during the day.
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature inside the house during the night.
Temperature during the day = 45 degrees
Temperature difference between day and night = 33 degrees
Temperature during the night = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the minimum temperature needed to prevent the pipes from freezing.
Minimum temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing = 32 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature increase needed to raise the temperature above 32 degrees.
Temperature increase needed = Minimum temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing - Temperature during the night
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
- Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees.
- It was 45 degrees during the day.
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature during the night.
Temperature during the night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature during the night = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the minimum temperature needed to prevent the pipes from freezing.
Minimum temperature needed = 32 degrees (to prevent the pipes from freezing)

Step 3: Calculate the temperature increase needed to reach the minimum temperature.
Temperature increase needed = Minimum temperature needed - Temperature during the night
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Step 4: Calculate the number of logs needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees.
Temperature increase per log = 5 degrees

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
2. During the day, the temperature was 45 degrees.
3. At night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day.
   * So the nighttime temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.
4. We need to raise the nighttime temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.
   * The difference in temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.
5. Each log of wood burned raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
   * So we need to burn enough logs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees.
   * 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

Therefore, the final answer is that Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.
