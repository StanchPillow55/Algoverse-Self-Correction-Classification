To solve this problem, we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day, given the information provided.

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each.
- The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.
- All the containers contain 5 vehicles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day.
Number of vehicles on the first day = 2 containers Ã— 5 vehicles per container = 10 vehicles

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional vehicles brought in on the second day.
Total number of vehicles - Number of vehicles on the first day = Number of additional vehicles on the second day
30 - 10 = 20 vehicles

Step 3: Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day.
Number of additional vehicles on the second day / Number of vehicles per container = Number of containers imported on the second day
20 vehicles / 5 vehicles per container = 4 containers

Therefore, the number of containers imported on the second day is 4 containers.

Final answer: 4 containers
