Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13.
- The discounted price of a tub of ice cream is $11.
- The original price of a packet of milk is unknown, but it is sold at a discount of $0.5.
- You want to buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

Step 1: Calculate the savings on the 2 tubs of ice cream.
Original price of 2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $13 = $26
Discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $11 = $22
Savings on 2 tubs of ice cream = $26 - $22 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the savings on the 4 packets of milk.
Original price of 4 packets of milk = 4 × (unknown price)
Discounted price of 4 packets of milk = 4 × ($unknown price - $0.5)
Savings on 4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ice cream tub:
   - Original price: $13
   - Discounted price: $11
   - Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2

2. Milk packet:
   - Original price: unknown
   - Discounted price: $0.5 less than original price

3. Calculating the total savings:
   - 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 × $2 = $4 saved
   - 4 packets of milk: 4 × $0.5 = $2 saved
   - Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

Therefore, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6.
