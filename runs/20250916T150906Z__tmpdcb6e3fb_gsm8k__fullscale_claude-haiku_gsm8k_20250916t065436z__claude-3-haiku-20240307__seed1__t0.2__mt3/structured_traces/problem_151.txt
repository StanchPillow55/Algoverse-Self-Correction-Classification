To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made by inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

Given information:
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated.
- 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
- 1 person came by on a unicycle.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the bicycles.
Number of bicycles × Number of tires per bicycle = Total number of tires inflated for bicycles
5 × 2 = 10 tires

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the tricycles.
Number of tricycles × Number of tires per tricycle = Total number of tires inflated for tricycles
3 × 3 = 9 tires

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the unicycle.
Number of unicycles × Number of tires per unicycle = Total number of tires inflate

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each.
   * 5 people with bicycles came by
   * Each bicycle has 2 tires
   * So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is: 5 people x 2 tires = 10 tires

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each.
   * 3 people with tricycles came by
   * Each tricycle has 3 tires
   * So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is: 3 people x 3 tires = 9 tires 

3. Unicycles have 1 tire each.
   * 1 person with a unicycle came by
   * The unicycle has 1 tire
   * So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is: 1 person x 1 tire = 1 tire

4. Calculating the total revenue:
   * Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate
   * Total tires inflated = 10

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated.
- 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
- 1 person came by on a unicycle.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated.
Bicycles: 5 people x 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
Tricycles: 3 people x 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
Unicycle: 1 person x 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire
Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from inflating the tires.
Cost per tire = $0.25
Total revenue = 20 tires x $0.25 per tire = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day from her bike inflation service
