Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
- Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.
- Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each.
- Kelly has 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
- Kelly's budget is $65.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the bacon.
Cost of 5 packs of bacon = $10
Cost of 1 pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the chicken.
Cost of 1 packet of chicken = 2 × $2 = $4
Cost of 6 packets of chicken = 6 × $4 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the strawberries.
Cost of 1 pack of strawberries = $4
Cost of 3 packs of strawber

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost $10 in total.
   * Cost of 1 pack of bacon = $10 / 5 = $2

2. Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   * Cost of 1 packet of chicken = 2 x $2 = $4
   * Total cost of 6 packets of chicken = 6 x $4 = $24

3. Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each costing $4.
   * Total cost of 3 packs of strawberries = 3 x $4 = $12

4. Kelly has 7 packs of apples, each costing half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   * Cost of 1 pack of apples = $4 / 2 = $2
   * Total cost of 7 packs of apples = 7 x $2 = $14

5. Now, let's calculate
