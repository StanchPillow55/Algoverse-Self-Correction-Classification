Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour
- Each widget sells for $6
- The machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days

Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets made per day by each machine.
Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1,440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1,080 widgets/day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of widgets made by each machine in 30 days.
Widgeteer 3000: 1,440 widgets/day x 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 1,080 widgets/day x 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in 30 days.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Widgeteer 3000 production:
   * Produces 60 widgets per hour
   * Runs for 24 hours per day
   * Runs for 30 days in a month
   * Total widgets produced = 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. WidgetMaster 9000 production:
   * Produces 45 widgets per hour
   * Runs for 24 hours per day
   * Runs for 30 days in a month
   * Total widgets produced = 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days = 32,400 widgets

3. Revenue calculation:
   * Each widget sells for $6
   * Widgeteer 3000 revenue = 43,200 widgets x $6/widget = $259,200
   * WidgetMaster 9000 revenue = 32,400 widgets x $6/widget = $194,400

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour
- Each widget sells for $6
- The machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days

Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets made by each machine in a month.
Widgeteer 3000:
Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days per month = Total widgets
60 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day × 30 days = 43,200 widgets

WidgetMaster 9000: 
Widgets per hour × Hours per day × Days per month = Total widgets
45 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day × 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated by each machine.
Total widgets × Price per widget = Total revenue
Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets × $6/widget = $259,200
