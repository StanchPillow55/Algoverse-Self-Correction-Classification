To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break.
3. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
Initial number of cars in the parking lot = 50
Number of additional cars during the first break = 20
Total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break = 50 + 20 = 70

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars that left the parking lot during the lunch break.
Number of cars that left the parking lot = 1/2 of the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break
Number of cars that left the parking lot = 1/2 Ã— 70 = 35

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.
Total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break = Total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break - Number of cars that
