To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit by adding up the individual charges.

Given information:
- Cost of the cast: $200
- Cost of the 30-minute visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes
- Cost of 30 painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
- Cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit.
Cost of the 30-minute visit = $300/hour × 0.5 hours = $150

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the 30 painkillers.
Cost of 30 painkillers = $4/pill × 30 pills = $120

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the parking.
Cost of parking = $6/hour × 2 hours = $12

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit.
Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the 30-minute visit + Cost of 30 painkillers + Cost of parking
Total cost = $200

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cost of the cast:
   * The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

2. Cost of the visit:
   * The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   * The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   * So the cost of the visit is $300 x 0.5 = $150.

3. Cost of the painkillers:
   * The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers.
   * Each painkiller costs $4.
   * So the cost of the painkillers is $4 x 30 = $120.

4. Cost of parking:
   * The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking.
   * So the cost of parking is $6 x 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
* Cost of cast: $200
* Cost of visit: $150
* Cost of painkillers: $120
* Cost of parking: $12
* Total

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
- The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit.
- The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers at $4/pill.
- The doctor requires a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking at $6/hour.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit.
Cost of the 30-minute visit = $300/hour × 0.5 hours = $150

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the painkillers.
Cost of 30 painkillers = $4/pill × 30 pills = $120

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mandatory parking.
Cost of 2 hours of parking = $6/hour × 2 hours = $12

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit.
Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the 30-minute visit + Cost of the painkillers + Cost of the parking
Total cost = $200 + $150
