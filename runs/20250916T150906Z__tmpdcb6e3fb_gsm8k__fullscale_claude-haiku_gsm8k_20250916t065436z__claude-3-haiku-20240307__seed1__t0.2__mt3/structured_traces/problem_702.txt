Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
- Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
- When all three trucks (Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's) are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Step 1: Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 5,000 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.
Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 pounds + 5,000 pounds = 9,000 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the capacity of Gary's truck.
Total capacity of all three trucks = 11,600 pounds

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. When all three trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:
* Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
* Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds
* Total: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Total capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 pounds

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from

Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 pounds + 5,000 pounds = 9,000 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the remaining capacity needed to reach the total of 11,600 pounds.
Remaining capacity needed = 11,600 pounds -
