To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Given information:
- It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.
- The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the city.
City width = 42 miles
Number of 3-mile segments = 42 miles ÷ 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city.
Time to cover each 3-mile segment = 10 minutes
Total time to cover the city = 14 segments × 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

Final answer: It will take 140 minutes (2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 10 minutes for the fog bank to cover every 3 miles of the city.
- The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to determine how many 3-mile segments the city is composed of, and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each 3-mile segment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city.
Number of 3-mile segments = 42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to cover the city.
Time to cover each 3-mile segment = 10 minutes
Total time to cover the city = 14 segments × 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the entire 42-mile city.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.
- The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city, and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each 3-mile segment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city.
Number of 3-mile segments = 42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to cover the whole city.
Time to cover each 3-mile segment = 10 minutes
Total time to cover the city = 14 segments × 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole 42-mile city.
