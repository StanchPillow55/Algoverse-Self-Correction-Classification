Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs.
- The Smith twins each found 30 eggs.
- All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins.
Eggs found by the Smith twins = 30 + 30 = 60 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs found by their friends.
Total eggs hidden - Eggs found by the Smith twins - Eggs not found = Eggs found by their friends
100 - 60 - 10 = 30 eggs

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

Final answer: The friends found 30 eggs.
