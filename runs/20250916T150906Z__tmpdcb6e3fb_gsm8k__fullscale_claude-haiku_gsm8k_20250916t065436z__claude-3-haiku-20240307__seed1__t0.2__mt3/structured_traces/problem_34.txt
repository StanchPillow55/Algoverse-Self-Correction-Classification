turn 1
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
- Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
- Raymond has 40 jewels.

Step 1: Find how many jewels Aaron has.
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so:
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Step 2: Find how many jewels Siobhan has.
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so:
Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   * Let's call the number of jewels Siobhan has as "x".
   * Then, the number of jewels Aaron has is "x + 2".

2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   * Raymond has 40 jewels.
   * Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20.
   * Aaron has 5 more than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

3. Putting it all together:
   * Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has x = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, the final answer is that Siobhan has 23 jewels.
