To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of cars Joe has initially.
2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has remaining.

Step 1: Find the number of cars Joe has initially.
Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has initially:
Joe's initial number of cars = 2 × Robert's number of cars = 2 × 20 = 40 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
Joe sold 20% of his cars, so we can calculate the number of cars he sold:
Number of cars sold = 20% of 40 cars = 0.20 × 40 = 8 cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
Joe gave away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, so we can calculate the number of cars he gave away:
Number of cars given away = 2 ×

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.
- Joe sells 20% of his cars.
- Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother.
- Robert has 20 cars.

Step 1: Find the number of cars Joe has initially.
Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, we can calculate Joe's initial number of cars as:
Joe's initial number of cars = 2 × Robert's number of cars
Joe's initial number of cars = 2 × 20 = 40 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
Joe sold 20% of his cars, so the number of cars he sold is:
Number of cars sold = 20% of 40 cars
Number of cars sold = 0.20 × 40 = 8 cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
Joe gave away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so the number of cars he gave away is:
Number of cars given away = 2

Joe sold 20% of his cars, so the number of cars he sold is:
Number of cars sold = 20% of 40 cars
Number of cars sold = 0.20 × 40 = 8 cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
Joe gave away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so the number of cars he gave away is:
