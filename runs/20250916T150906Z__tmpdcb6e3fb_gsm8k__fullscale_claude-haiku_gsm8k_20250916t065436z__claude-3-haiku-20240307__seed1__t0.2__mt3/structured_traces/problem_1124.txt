To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final result to find the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning.

Given information:
- Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
- Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.
- Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

Step 1: Find the number of stickers Kris received from Luis.
Kris received the remaining stickers from Luis, which is half of the stickers Luis had.
Kris received = 9 + 7 = 16 stickers

Step 2: Find the number of stickers Luis had.
Luis had twice the number of stickers Kris received, as he used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.
Luis had = 16 Ã— 2 = 32 stickers

Step 3: Find the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis.
Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis is equal to the number of stickers Luis had.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   * Let's say Seth had 'x' stickers to begin with.
   * Seth gave half of 'x' stickers to Luis, which is 'x/2' stickers.

2. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth.
   * Luis received 'x/2' stickers from Seth.
   * Luis used half of those, which is '(x/2)/2 = x/4' stickers.
   * Luis had the remaining '(x/2) - (x/4) = x/4' stickers left.

3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris.
   * Luis had 'x/4' stickers left.
   * Luis gave all of those stickers to Kris.

4. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 to Rob.
   * Kris received 'x/4' stickers from Luis.
   * Kris kept 9 stickers
