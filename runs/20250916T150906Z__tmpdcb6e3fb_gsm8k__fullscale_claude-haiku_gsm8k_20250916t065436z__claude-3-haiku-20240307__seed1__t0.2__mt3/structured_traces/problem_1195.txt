To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant at different times.

Given information:
- In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
- At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant and ordered the same amount of food as the first people.
- After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch.
- By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00.
Number of people who entered at 10:00 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant after the 10:00 group.
Number of people who entered after the 10:00 group = 2 × 40 = 80

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who entered the restaurant by evening.
Number of people who entered by evening = 3 × 50 = 150

Step 4: Calculate the total number
