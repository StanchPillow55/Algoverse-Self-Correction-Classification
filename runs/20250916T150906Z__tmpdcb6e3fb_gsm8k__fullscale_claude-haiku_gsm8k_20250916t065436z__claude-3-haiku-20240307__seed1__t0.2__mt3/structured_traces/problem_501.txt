Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
- Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
- There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah.
Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
Amount of yarn used by Mariah = 1/4 × 364 yards = 91 yards

Step 2: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandma.
Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
Amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandma = 1/2 × 364 yards = 182 yards

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma.
Total amount of yarn used = Amount of yarn used by Mariah + Amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandma
Total amount of yarn used = 91 yards +
