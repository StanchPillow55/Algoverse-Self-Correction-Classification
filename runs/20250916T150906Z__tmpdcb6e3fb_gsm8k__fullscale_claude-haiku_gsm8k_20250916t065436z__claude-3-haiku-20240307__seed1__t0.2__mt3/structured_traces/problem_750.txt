To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends, and then add them together to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

Given information:
- During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During the weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.
- The problem is asking for the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays.
Number of weekdays in a 4-week month = 4 weeks × 5 days per week = 20 days
Number of chairs rented during the weekdays in one 4-week month = 60 chairs per day × 20 days = 1,200 chairs
Number of chairs rented during the weekdays in two 4-week months = 1,200 chairs × 2 = 2,400 chairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekends.
Number of weekend days in a 4-week month = 4

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During the weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs per day.
2. During the weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs per day.
3. We need to find the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out during the weekdays:
* 4 weeks x 5 weekdays per week = 20 weekdays
* 20 weekdays x 60 chairs per day = 1,200 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out during the weekends:
* 4 weeks x 2 weekend days per week = 8 weekend days
* 8 weekend days x 100 chairs per day = 800 chairs

Now, we can add the weekday and weekend totals together to get the grand total:
* 1,200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2,000 chairs

Since the question asks for the total in two 4-week months, we need to double the grand total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

2. During the weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs per day.
3. We need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out in one 4-week month:
* 4 weeks x 5 weekdays per week = 20 weekdays
* 20 weekdays x 60 chairs per day = 1,200 chairs rented out on weekdays
* 4 weekends x 2 days per weekend = 8 weekend days
* 8 weekend days x 100 chairs per day = 800 chairs rented out on weekends
* Total chairs rented out in one 4-week month = 1,200 + 800 = 2,000 chairs

Now, to find the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months, we simply double the amount:
* 2 x 2
