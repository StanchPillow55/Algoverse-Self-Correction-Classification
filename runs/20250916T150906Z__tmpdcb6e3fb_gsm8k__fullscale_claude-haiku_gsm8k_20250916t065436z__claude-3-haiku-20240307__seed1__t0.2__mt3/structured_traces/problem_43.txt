Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
- A 300g bag has 5 servings.
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips.
Total calories in the bag = Calories per serving × Number of servings
Total calories in the bag = 250 calories × 5 servings = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume for the day.
Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.
Maximum grams of chips = (Remaining calories / Calories per serving) × Grams per bag
Maximum grams of chips = (200 calories / 250 calories per serving) × 300 grams
Maximum grams of

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
2. The bag is 300g and has 5 servings.
3. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
4. To find how many grams you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories in the bag of chips.
5. Total calories in the bag = 250 calories per serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.
6. Now, we need to find out how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
7. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 200 calories left.
8. To find how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to divide the remaining 200 calories by the calorie density of the chips, which is 250 calories per serving.
9. 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.
Maximum grams of chips = (Remaining calories / Calories per serving) × Grams per bag
Maximum grams of chips = (200 calories / 250 calories per serving) × 300 grams
Maximum grams of chips = 0.8 × 300 grams = 240
