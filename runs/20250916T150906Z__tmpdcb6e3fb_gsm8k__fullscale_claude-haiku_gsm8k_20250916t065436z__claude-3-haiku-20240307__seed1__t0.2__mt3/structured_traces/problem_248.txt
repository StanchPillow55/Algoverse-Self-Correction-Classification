Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The chef bought 4 bags of onions.
- Each bag weighs 50 pounds.
- The cost of 1 pound of onions is $1.50.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the onions.
Total weight of onions = Number of bags × Weight per bag
Total weight of onions = 4 × 50 pounds = 200 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the onions.
Total cost = Total weight of onions × Cost per pound
Total cost = 200 pounds × $1.50 per pound = $300

Therefore, the chef spent $300 on the 4 bags of onions.

Final answer: The chef spent $300 on the 4 bags of onions.
