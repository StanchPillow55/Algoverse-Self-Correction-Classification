To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance covered by each train in the two-day journey.

Given information:
- Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time and travel westward for 80 miles.
- The next day, they travel northwards for 150 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the distance covered by each train on the first day.
Distance covered on the first day = 80 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance covered by each train on the second day.
Distance covered on the second day = 150 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered by each train in the two-day journey.
Total distance covered = Distance covered on the first day + Distance covered on the second day
Total distance covered = 80 miles + 150 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, the distance covered by each train in the two-day journey is 230 miles.

Final answer: The distance covered by each train in the two-day journey is 230 miles.
