Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jana has 27 puppies.
- Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
- One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.

Two-thirds of 27 puppies = (2/3) × 27 = 18 Pomeranians

Step 2: Find the number of girl Pomeranians.
One-third of 18 Pomeranians = (1/3) × 18 = 6 girl Pomeranians

Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.
