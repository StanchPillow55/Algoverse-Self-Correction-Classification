Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam's target is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.
- He was closed on Monday and Friday.
- Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.
- On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
- On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
- On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crates sold during the week.
Crates sold on the weekend: 20
Crates sold on Tuesday: 15
Crates sold on Wednesday: 12
Crates sold on Thursday: 18
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Step 2: Calculate the target number of crates to be sold during the week.
Since Sam was closed on Monday and Friday, he had 5 days to sell the 120 crates.
Target crates per day = 120 crates / 5 days = 24 crates per day

Weekend sales: 20 crates
Tuesday sales: 15 crates
Wednesday sales: 12 crates
Thursday sales: 18 crates
Total crates sold = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates

Step 2: Calculate the target number of crates to be sold during the week.
Target crates per week = 120 crates

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the target and the actual number of crates sold.
Difference = Target crates - Actual crates sold
Difference = 120 - 65 =
