Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

Step 1: Calculate Susan's weight.
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

Step 2: Calculate Bob's weight.
Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds = 260 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the three friends.
Total weight = Mark's weight + Susan's weight + Bob's weight
Total weight = 150 pounds + 130 pounds + 260 pounds = 540 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the average weight of the three friends.
Average weight = Total weight / Number of friends
Average weight = 540 pounds / 3 = 180 pounds

Therefore, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.
