Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.
- Jonathan has two dozen (24) measuring cups.
- Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has.
Since Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, we can use the following equation:
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 × Number of measuring cups
Number of measuring spoons = 2/3 × 24 = 16 measuring spoons

Step 2: Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has remaining after gifting 6 to Pedro.
Number of measuring spoons remaining = Number of measuring spoons - Number of spoons gifted
Number of measuring spoons remaining = 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons

Step 3: Calculate the total number of utensils (cups and spoons) Jonathan has remaining.
Total number of utensils remaining = Number of measuring cups + Number of measuring spoons remaining
Total number of

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.
   * If he has two dozen (24) cups, then he has 24 * 2/3 = 16 measuring spoons.

2. Jonathan gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons for his birthday.
   * So, he now has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons remaining.

3. To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining, we add the number of measuring cups and the number of measuring spoons.
   * Total utensils = 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils

Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 34.
