Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A basket of green food costs $25.
- A basket of red food costs $18.
- You buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 3 baskets of green food.
Cost of 3 baskets of green food = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the 3 baskets of red food without the discount.
Cost of 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $18 = $54

Step 3: Calculate the discount for the 3 baskets of red food.
Discount for 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $2 = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
Total cost = Cost of 3 baskets of green food + Cost of 3 baskets of red food - Discount
Total cost = $75 + $54

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A basket of green food costs $25.
- A basket of red food costs $18.
- You buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food.
- You get $2 off for each basket of red food.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the green food.
Cost of 3 baskets of green food = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the red food before the discount.
Cost of 3 baskets of red food = 3 × $18 = $54

Step 3: Calculate the discount for the red food.
Discount per basket of red food = $2
Total discount = 3 × $2 = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total cost after the discount.
Total cost = Cost of green food + Cost of red food - Discount
Total cost = $75 + $54 - $6 = $123

Therefore, the total amount you will have to pay is $123.
