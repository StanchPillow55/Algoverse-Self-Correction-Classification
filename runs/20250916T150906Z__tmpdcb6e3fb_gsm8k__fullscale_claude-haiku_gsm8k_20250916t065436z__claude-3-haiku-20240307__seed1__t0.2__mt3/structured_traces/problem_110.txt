To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, and then calculate the average.

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice ate.
Beatrice's fruit roll-ups = 2 roll-ups wide × 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell ate.
Marcell's fruit roll-ups = 3 roll-ups wide × 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate.
Total fruit roll-ups eaten = Beatrice's fruit roll-ups + Marcell's fruit roll-ups
Total fruit roll-ups eaten = 48

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person.
2. Add the total number of fruit roll-ups for both people.
3. Divide the total by 2 to find the average.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person.
Beatrice's total: 2 roll-ups wide x 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups
Marcell's total: 3 roll-ups wide x 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups

Step 2: Add the total number of fruit roll-ups for both people.
Total fruit roll-ups = Beatrice's total + Marcell's total

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for Beatrice.
Beatrice's roll-up dimensions: 2 roll-ups wide x 24 roll-ups long
Total roll-ups for Beatrice = 2 x 24 = 48 roll-ups

Step 2: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for Marcell.
Marcell's roll-up dimensions: 3 roll-ups wide x 14 roll-ups long
Total roll-ups for Marcell = 3 x 14 = 42 roll-ups

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice.
Total roll-ups eaten = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
