Certainly! Let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Wilson needs to have a math grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend.
- His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.
- The test scores he received are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores.

Step 1: Add up the 5 test scores.
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Step 2: Divide the sum by the number of test scores to find the average.
Average = 400 รท 5 = 80

Therefore, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

Final answer: Wilson's current math grade is 80.
