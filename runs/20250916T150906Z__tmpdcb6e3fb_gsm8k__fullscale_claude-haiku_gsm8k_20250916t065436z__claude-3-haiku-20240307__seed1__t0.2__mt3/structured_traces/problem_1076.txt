To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each.
- Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.
- Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling milkshakes.
Total revenue from milkshakes = Number of milkshakes × Price per milkshake
Total revenue from milkshakes = 6 × $5.50 = $33.00

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling burger platters.
Total revenue from burger platters = Number of burger platters × Price per burger platter
Total revenue from burger platters = 9 × $11 = $99.00

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling sodas.
Total revenue from sodas = Number of sodas × Price per soda
Total revenue from sodas = 20 × $1.50 = $30.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each:
   * 6 milkshakes x $5.50 each = $33.00

2. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each:
   * 9 burger platters x $11 each = $99.00

3. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each:
   * 20 sodas x $1.50 each = $30.00

4. To calculate the total money Terry makes, we add up the amounts from each item:
   * $33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162.00.
