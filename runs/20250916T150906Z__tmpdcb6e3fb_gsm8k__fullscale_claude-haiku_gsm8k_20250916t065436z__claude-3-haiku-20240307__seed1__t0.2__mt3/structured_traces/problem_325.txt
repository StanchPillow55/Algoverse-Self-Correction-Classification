To solve this problem, we need to find the number of senior programmers, the number of junior programmers, and the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Given information:
- The company has 100 employees.
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
- The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.

Step 1: Find the number of junior programmers.
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 × 100 = 40 junior programmers

Step 2: Find the number of senior programmers.
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary of the senior programmers.
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = Monthly salary of a junior programmer + $400
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company has a total of 100 employees.
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
- The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of junior programmers.
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 × 100 = 40 junior programmers

Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers.
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary of the junior programmers.
Monthly salary of junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000

Step 4: Calculate the monthly salary of the senior programmers.
Monthly salary of senior programmers = 60 × ($2000 + $
