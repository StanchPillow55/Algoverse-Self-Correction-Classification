Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium.
- The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the same number of fish.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of fish in each aquarium.

Step 1: Find the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.
Difference in snails = 32 - 4 = 28 snails

Step 2: The difference in snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums.
Difference in snails = 2 × (total fish in both aquariums)
28 = 2 × (2x)
28 = 4x

Step 3: Solve for the number of fish in each aquarium.
4x = 28
x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

Final answer: There are 7
