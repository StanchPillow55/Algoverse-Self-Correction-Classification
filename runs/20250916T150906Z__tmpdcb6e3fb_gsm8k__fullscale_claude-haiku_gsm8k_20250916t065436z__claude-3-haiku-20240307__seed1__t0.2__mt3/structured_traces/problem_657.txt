To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.

Given information:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar.
- James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hangar.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
Cost of renting the hangar per month = $5,000
Cost of renting the hangar for the first year = $5,000 × 12 months = $60,000

Step 2: Calculate the cost of fuel for the first year.
Cost of fuel per month = 2 × $5,000 = $10,000
Cost of fuel for the first year = $10,000 × 12 months = $120,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.
Total cost = Cost of the plane + Cost of renting the hangar for the first year + Cost of fuel for the first year
Total cost = $150,000 + $60

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar.
- James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hangar.

To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the following:
1. The cost of the plane
2. The cost of renting the hangar for the first year
3. The cost of fuel for the first year

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane.
Cost of the plane = $150,000

Step 2: Calculate the cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
Cost of renting the hangar per month = $5,000
Cost of renting the hangar for the first year = $5,000 × 12 months = $60,000

Step 3: Calculate the cost of fuel for the first year.
Cost of fuel per month = 2 × $5,000 = $10,000
Cost of fuel for the first year = $10,

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar.
- James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hangar.

To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the following:
1. The total cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
2. The total cost of fuel for the first year.
3. Add the cost of the plane to the total cost of the hangar and fuel.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
Cost of renting the hangar per month = $5,000
Total cost of renting the hangar for the first year = $5,000 × 12 months = $60,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of fuel for the first year.
Cost of fuel per month = 2 × $5,000 = $10,000
Total cost of fuel for the first year = $10,000
