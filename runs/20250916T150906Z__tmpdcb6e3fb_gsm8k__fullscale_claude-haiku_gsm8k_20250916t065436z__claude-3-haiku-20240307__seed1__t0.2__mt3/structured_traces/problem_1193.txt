Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jason can earn $3.00 for doing his laundry
- Jason can earn $1.50 for cleaning his room
- Jason can earn $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb each week
- Jason can earn $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher

In a two-week period:
- Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times
- Jason did his laundry once
- Jason took the trash out twice
- Jason cleaned his room once

To calculate the total amount of money Jason earned, we need to multiply the rate for each task by the number of times he completed that task, then add them all together.

Emptying the dishwasher:
- 6 times x $0.50 per time = $3.00

Doing laundry:
- 1 time x $3.00 per time = $3.00 

Taking out the trash:
- 2 times x $0.75 per time = $1.50
