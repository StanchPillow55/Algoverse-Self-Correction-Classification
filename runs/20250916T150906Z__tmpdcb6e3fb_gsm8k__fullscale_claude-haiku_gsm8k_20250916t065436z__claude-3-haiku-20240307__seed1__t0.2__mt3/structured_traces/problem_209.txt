Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
- Each plate is sold at $6000.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
Total cost of half a dozen plates = 6 × $6000 = $36,000

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 20 dozen cups.
Total cost of 20 dozen cups = Total cost of half a dozen plates - $1200
Total cost of 20 dozen cups = $36,000 - $1200 = $34,800

Step 3: Calculate the cost of one cup.
Number of cups in 20 dozen = 20 × 12 = 240 cups
Cost of one cup = Total cost of 20 dozen cups / 240 cups
Cost of one cup = $34,800 / 240 = $145

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $145.
