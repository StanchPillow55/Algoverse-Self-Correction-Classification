To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and keep track of the number of bees leaving and returning to the hive throughout the day.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before but hadn't returned yet, return to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that return to the hive in the second 6 hours.
Number of bees that return in the second 6 hours = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that leave the hive in the third 6 hours.
Number of bees that leave in the third 6 hours = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of that number (30) return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive (30) fly from the hive and leave.
- In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned, returns to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that returned to the hive in the second 6-hour period.
Number of bees that returned = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the third 6-hour period.
Number of bees that left = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Step 3: Calculate the number of bees that had not yet returned to the hive.
