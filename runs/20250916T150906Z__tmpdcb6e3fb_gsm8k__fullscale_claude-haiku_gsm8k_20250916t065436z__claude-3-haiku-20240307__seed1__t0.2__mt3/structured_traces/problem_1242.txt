Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Skyler has 100 hats in total
- Half of the hats are red
- 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue
- The rest are white

Step 1: Calculate the number of red hats.
Half of 100 hats = 100 / 2 = 50 red hats

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining hats (non-red hats).
Total hats - Red hats = Remaining hats
100 - 50 = 50 remaining hats

Step 3: Calculate the number of blue hats.
3/5 of the remaining 50 hats = 3/5 Ã— 50 = 30 blue hats

Step 4: Calculate the number of white hats.
Total remaining hats - Blue hats = White hats
50 - 30 = 20 white hats

Therefore, Skyler has 20 white hats.
