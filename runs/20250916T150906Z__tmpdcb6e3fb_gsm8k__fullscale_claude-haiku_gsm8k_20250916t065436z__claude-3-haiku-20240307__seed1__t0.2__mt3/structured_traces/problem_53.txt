To solve this problem, we need to calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the higher revenue day and the lower revenue day.

Given information:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired and $40 for each car tire repaired.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.
Revenue from truck tires = 6 × $60 = $360
Revenue from car tires = 4 × $40 = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.
Revenue from truck tires = 0 × $60 = $0
Revenue from car tires = 12 × $40 = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Step 3: Determine the day with the higher revenue.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire repaired.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.
Revenue from truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.
Revenue from truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
Revenue from car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Step 3: Determine which day had the higher revenue.
