To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's time for the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Calculate the difference in time between Lee and Gerald's original times.
3. Calculate Gerald's new time after the 10% improvement in speed.

Step 1: Determine Lee's time for the 400-meter hurdles.
Lee's time for the 400-meter hurdles = 38 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the difference in time between Lee and Gerald's original times.
Since Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, we can calculate Gerald's original time as follows:
Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 3: Calculate Gerald's new time after the 10% improvement in speed.
To calculate Gerald's new time, we need to find the 10% improvement in his original time.
10% of 40 seconds = 0.1 Ã— 40 = 4 seconds
Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
- Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change.
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

Step 1: Find Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles.
Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can add 2 seconds to Lee's time to get Gerald's original time.
Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate Gerald's new time after his 10% speed improvement.
Percent improvement = 10%
Improvement factor = 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time / Improvement factor
Gerald's new time = 40 seconds / 1.10 = 36.36 seconds

Step 3: Round the final answer to the nearest whole second.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles 2 seconds faster than Gerald.
- Gerald's speed improved by 10% due to his diet change.
- Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.

Step 1: Find how fast Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles.
Since Lee runs 2 seconds faster than Gerald, we can add 2 seconds to Lee's time to find Gerald's original time.
Gerald's original time = Lee's time + 2 seconds
Gerald's original time = 38 seconds + 2 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate Gerald's new time after his 10% speed improvement.
Percent improvement = 10%
Improvement factor = 1 + 0.10 = 1.10
Gerald's new time = Gerald's original time / Improvement factor
Gerald's new time = 40 seconds / 1.10 = 36.36 seconds

Step 3: Round the final answer to the nearest whole second.
