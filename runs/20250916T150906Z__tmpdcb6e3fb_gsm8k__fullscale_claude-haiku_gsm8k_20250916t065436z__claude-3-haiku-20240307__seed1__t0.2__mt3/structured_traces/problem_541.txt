To solve this problem, we need to find the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April to hit his monthly saving target.

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.

Step 1: Determine the number of days in April.
April has 30 days.

Step 2: Determine the number of days in the first half and second half of April.
First half of April: 15 days
Second half of April: 15 days

Step 3: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the first half of April.
Total saving target for the month: $1125
Amount to be saved in the first half: $1125 / 2 = $562.50
Amount to be saved each day in the first half: $562.50 / 15 days = $37.50

Step 4: Calculate the amount Elvis needs to save each day in the second half of April.
Amount to be saved in the second half: $1125 - $562.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half, in order to hit his target.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in April.
Total savings target = $1125

Step 2: Divide the total savings target by the number of days in April to get the average daily savings.
Number of days in April = 30 days
Average daily savings = $1125 / 30 days = $37.50 per day

Step 3: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month.
First half of the month = 15 days
Amount to save in the first half = 15 days × $37.50 per day = $562.50

Step 4: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month.
Second half of the month = 15 days
Total savings target - Amount saved in first half = Amount to save in second half
