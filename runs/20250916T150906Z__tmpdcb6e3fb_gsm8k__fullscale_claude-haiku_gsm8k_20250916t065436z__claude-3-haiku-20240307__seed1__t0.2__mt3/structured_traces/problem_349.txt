Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of food per month.
Cost of food per week = $25
Cost of food per month = $25 × 4 weeks = $100

Step 2: Calculate the total cost per month.
Cost of food per month = $100
Cost of treats per month = $20
Cost of medicine per month = $100
Total cost per month = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per year.
Total cost per year = Total cost per month × 12 months
Total cost per year = $220 × 12 = $2,640

Therefore, Madeline spends $2,640 on her dog per year.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of food.
Food cost per week = $25
Food cost per month = $25 × 4 weeks = $100

Step 2: Calculate the yearly cost of food.
Yearly food cost = $100 per month × 12 months = $1,200

Step 3: Calculate the yearly cost of treats.
Treats cost per month = $20
Yearly treats cost = $20 per month × 12 months = $240

Step 4: Calculate the yearly cost of medicine.
Medicine cost per month = $100
Yearly medicine cost = $100 per month × 12 months = $1,200

Step 5: Calculate the total yearly cost for Madeline's dog.
Total yearly cost = Yearly food cost + Yearly treats cost + Yearly medicine cost
Total yearly cost = $1,200
