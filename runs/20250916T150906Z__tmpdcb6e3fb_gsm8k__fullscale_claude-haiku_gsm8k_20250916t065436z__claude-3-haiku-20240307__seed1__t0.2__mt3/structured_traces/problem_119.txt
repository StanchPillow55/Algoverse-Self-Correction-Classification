To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later to get the total salary.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
Let's represent Lylah's salary as x.
Adrien's salary = 1.3x (30% higher than Lylah's)
We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
Therefore, 1.3x = $40,000
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769.23

Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% compared to four years ago

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
- Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago.
- Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously.
- Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

Step 1: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000

Step 2: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can use the following equation:
Adrien's salary = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23

Step 3: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
