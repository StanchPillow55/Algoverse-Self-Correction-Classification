Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 4 friends ordered 4 pizzas for a total of $64
- 2 of the pizzas cost $30 each

To find the cost of the other 2 pizzas, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 pizzas that cost $30 each
2. Subtract that total from the overall $64 to get the cost of the other 2 pizzas
3. Divide the remaining cost by 2 to get the cost of each of the other 2 pizzas

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 pizzas that cost $30 each.
Cost of 2 pizzas at $30 each = 2 Ã— $30 = $60

Step 2: Subtract the total cost of the 2 pizzas at $30 each from the overall $64.
Total cost of all 4 pizzas - Total cost of 2 pizzas at $30 each = Cost of the other 2 pizzas
$64 - $60

2 pizzas x $30 per pizza = $60

Step 2: Subtract the $60 from the overall $64 to get the cost of the other 2 pizzas
$64 - $60 = $4

Step 3: Divide the remaining $4 by 2 to get the cost of each of the other 2 pizzas
$4 / 2 = $2
