Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 12 team members
- There are 3 coaches
- Each team member brings 2 guests
- A pizza will serve 3 people
- Each pizza costs $15

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to feed.
Total number of people = Number of team members + Number of coaches + Number of guests
Total number of people = 12 + 3 + (12 × 2) = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas Maddy needs to buy.
Number of pizzas needed = Total number of people / Number of people per pizza
Number of pizzas needed = 39 / 3 = 13 pizzas

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.
Total cost = Number of pizzas × Cost per pizza
Total cost = 13 × $15 = $195

Therefore, Maddy will spend $195 on the pizzas for her cousin's soccer game.
