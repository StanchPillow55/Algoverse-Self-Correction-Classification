Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.
- On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.

Step 1: Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
Since Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, and Robert collected 20 shells, we can calculate Kylie's Monday collection as:
Kylie's Monday collection = Robert's Monday collection + 5
Kylie's Monday collection = 20 + 5 = 25 shells

Step 2: Calculate how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 × Kylie's Monday collection
Kylie's Tuesday collection = 2 × 25 = 50 shells

Therefore, the final answer is:
Kylie collected 50 shells on Tuesday.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.
