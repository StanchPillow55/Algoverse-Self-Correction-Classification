Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.
- The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct.
- The second test has 40 questions.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test.
60% of 70 questions = 0.60 × 70 = 42 questions correct

Step 2: Calculate the total number of questions on both tests.
Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Step 3: Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct to move on to the 7th grade.
70% of 110 questions = 0.70 × 110 = 77 questions correct

Step 4: Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test.
Number of questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions correct on the first test

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.
2. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct.
   * 60% of 70 questions = 0.6 x 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.

3. The second test has 40 questions.
4. To calculate the total number of questions, we add the questions from both tests:
   * Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

5. To calculate 70% of the total questions:
   * 70% of 110 questions = 0.7 x 110 = 77 questions

6. Now we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test.
   * Total questions she needs to get right = 77
   * Questions she got right on the first test = 42
   * Questions she needs to get right on the second test = 77 - 42 =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.

2. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct.
   * 60% of 70 questions = 0.6 x 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.

3. The second test has 40 questions.
   * We need to find how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the 70% threshold.

4. To calculate the total number of questions:
   * First test: 70 questions
   * Second test: 40 questions
   * Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

5. 70% of 110 questions = 0.7 x 110 = 77 questions needed to be answered correctly.

6. Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test.
   * So, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
