To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool.
2. Multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons of water needed.
3. Multiply the number of gallons by the cost per gallon to find the total cost.

Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool.
The formula for the volume of a rectangular pool is:
Volume = Length × Width × Depth

Given information:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Calculating the volume:
Volume = 25 feet × 14 feet × 4 feet
Volume = 1,400 cubic feet

Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.
The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons of water needed.
Number of gallons = Volume × 5.9
Number of gallons = 1,400 cubic feet × 5.9
Number of gallons = 8,260 gallons

Step 3:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   * The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.
   * Volume = length x width x depth
   * Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet
   * Volume = 1,400 cubic feet

2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons:
   * The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   * Gallons = Volume x 5.9
   * Gallons = 1,400 cubic feet x 5.9
   * Gallons = 8,260 gallons

3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   * The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
   * Total cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = 8,260 gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = $826.00

Therefore, the total
