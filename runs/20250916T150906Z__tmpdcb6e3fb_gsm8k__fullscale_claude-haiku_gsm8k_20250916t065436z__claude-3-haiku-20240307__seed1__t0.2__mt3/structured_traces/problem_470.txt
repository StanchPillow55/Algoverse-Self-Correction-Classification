Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Theo bought a pen for $2.
- The piece of paper cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
- Theo gave the cashier $10.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the piece of paper.
Cost of the piece of paper = 3 Ã— $2 - $1 = $5

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items Theo bought.
Total cost = Cost of the pen + Cost of the piece of paper
Total cost = $2 + $5 = $7

Step 3: Calculate the amount of change Theo received.
Amount of change = Amount given to the cashier - Total cost
Amount of change = $10 - $7 = $3

Therefore, the amount of change Theo received is $3.
