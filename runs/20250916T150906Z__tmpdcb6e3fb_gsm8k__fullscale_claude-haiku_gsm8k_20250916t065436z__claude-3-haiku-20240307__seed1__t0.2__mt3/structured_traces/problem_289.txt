To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane and then calculate the time it took to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

Given information:
- The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
- The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.
- The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles.

Step 1: Find the speed of the car in the slow lane.
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 1/2 × Speed of the car in the fast lane
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 1/2 × 60 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance of 480 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
- The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.
- The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane.
Speed of the car in the slow lane = 1/2 × 60 miles/hour = 30 miles/hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it took the car in the fast lane to travel 480 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it took the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance of 480 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.
