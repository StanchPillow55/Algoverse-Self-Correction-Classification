Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write.
- On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
- On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday.
Number of articles on Tuesday = Number of articles on Monday + 2/5 × Number of articles on Monday
Number of articles on Tuesday = 5 + 2/5 × 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 articles

Step 2: Calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday.
Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 × Number of articles on Tuesday
Number of articles on Wednesday = 2 × 7 = 14 articles

Step 3: Calculate the total number of articles Meredith wrote in the three days.
Total number of articles = Number of articles on Monday + Number of articles on Tuesday + Number of articles
