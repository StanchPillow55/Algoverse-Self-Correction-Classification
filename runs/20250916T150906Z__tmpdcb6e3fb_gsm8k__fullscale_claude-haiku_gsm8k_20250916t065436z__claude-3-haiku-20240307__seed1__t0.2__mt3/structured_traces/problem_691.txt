Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each.
- The dog also needs a heartworm check.
- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
- John brought $125 with him.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 2 vaccines.
Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
Let's call the total bill "x".
Heartworm check = 0.6x

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total bill.
Total bill = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
x = $40 + 0.6x

Step 4: Solve the equation for the total bill.
x = $40 + 0.6x
0.4x = $40
x = $100

Step 5: Calculate the amount John leaves with.
John brought $125

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each.
   * Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 x $20 = $40

2. The dog also needs a heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill.
   * Let's call the total bill 'x'.
   * Heartworm check = 0.6x

3. The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   * Total bill = $40 + 0.6x

4. John brought $125 with him.
   * We want to find how much he leaves with, which is the amount he brought minus the total bill.
   * Amount left = $125 - ($40 + 0.6x)

5. To find the value of 'x', we can set the amount left equal to 0 and solve for x.
   * $125 - ($40 + 0.6x) = 0
   * $125 - $40 - 0.6x

- John brought $125 with him.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 2 vaccines.
Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.
Let the total bill be x.
Heartworm check = 60% of x = 0.6x

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total bill.
Total bill = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
x = $40 + 0.6x

Step 4: Solve the equation to find the total bill.
x - 0.6x = $40
0.4x = $40
x = $100

Step 5: Calculate the amount John leaves with.
Amount John brought = $125
Total bill = $100
