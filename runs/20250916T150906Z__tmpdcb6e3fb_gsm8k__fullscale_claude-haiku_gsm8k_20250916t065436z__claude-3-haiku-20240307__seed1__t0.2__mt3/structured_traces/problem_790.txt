turn 1
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group:
   * Number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10 groups

4. Now, we are told that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each.
5. To find the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
   * Number of groups with 2 seashells each = 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups

6. Finally, to find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups with 2 seashells each by the number of seashells each member brought back:
   * Total number of seashells = 6 groups * 2 seashells

turn 2
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There were 90 people total who needed to be split into groups.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9):
   * 90 รท 9 = 10 groups

4. Now, we need to find how many of those 10 groups had 3/5 of the members bring back 2 seashells each.
   * 3/5 of 10 groups = 6 groups

5. Each of those 6 groups had 2 seashells brought back by 3/5 of the 9 members.
   * 3/5 of 9 = 5.4 (rounded to 5 members per group)
   * 5 members x 2 seashells each = 10 seashells per group
   * 10 seashells per group x 6 groups = 60 se

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group:
   * Number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10 groups

4. We are told that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each.
5. To find the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
   * Number of groups with 2 seashells each = 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups

6. Now, we need to find the total number of seashells brought back. Since each member in those 6 groups brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells per group:
   * Total number of seashells = 6
