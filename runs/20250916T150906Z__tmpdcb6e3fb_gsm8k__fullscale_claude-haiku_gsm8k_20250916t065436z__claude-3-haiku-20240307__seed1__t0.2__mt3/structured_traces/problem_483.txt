Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs.
- Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his player.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel on his player.

Step 1: Find out how many songs Luri has on his player.
Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs

Step 2: Find out how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player.
Gabriel's player capacity - Gabriel's current songs = Songs Gabriel can add
100 - 20 = 80 songs

Step 3: Find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player.
Luri's player capacity - Luri's current songs = Songs Luri can add
100 - 60 = 40 songs

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add.
Songs Gabriel can add - Songs Luri can add =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs.
- Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his player.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel on his player.

Step 1: Calculate how many songs Luri has on his player.
Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining space on each player.
Gabriel's remaining space = 100 - 20 = 80 songs
Luri's remaining space = 100 - 60 = 40 songs

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the remaining space on each player.
Difference in remaining space = Gabriel's remaining space - Luri's remaining space
Difference in remaining space = 80 - 40 = 40 songs

Therefore, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

Final answer: Luri can add 40 fewer
