Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
- 1 cookie has 200 calories.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday.
Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4 × 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday.
Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2 × 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.
   * Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
   * So, Sue ate 4 x 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

3. Total cookies eaten by Sue:
   * Monday: 20 cookies
   * Tuesday: 26 cookies
   * Total: 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

4. Total cookies eaten by her sister:
   * Monday: 5 cookies
   * Tuesday: 13 cookies
   * Total: 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

5. Calories per cookie: 200 calories

6. Calories consumed by Sue:
