Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of cats on the rock:
   * 50 cats

2. Cats carried away by the boats:
   * 4 boats, each carrying 5 cats
   * 4 x 5 = 20 cats carried away

3. Remaining cats on the rock after the boats left:
   * 50 - 20 = 30 cats

4. Cats that ran after the mouse:
   * 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats
   * 3/5 x 30 = 18 cats

5. Cats left on the rock:
   * 30 - 18 = 12 cats

Therefore, the final answer is:
12 cats were left on the rock.
