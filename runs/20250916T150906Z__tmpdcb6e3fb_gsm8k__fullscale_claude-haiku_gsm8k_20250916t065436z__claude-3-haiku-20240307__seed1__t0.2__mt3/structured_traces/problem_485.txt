Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost.
- Jillian's shoes cost $80.

Step 1: Find the cost of the handbag.
Cost of the handbag = 3 × Cost of the shoes - $20
Cost of the handbag = 3 × $80 - $20
Cost of the handbag = $240 - $20
Cost of the handbag = $220

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question states that the handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of the shoes.
2. We know that the shoes cost $80.
3. To find the cost of the handbag, we first need to calculate 3 times the cost of the shoes, which is 3 × $80 = $240.
4. Then, we subtract $20 from $240 to get the cost of the handbag, which is $240 - $20 = $220.
