Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
- She sold the rest.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.
Total number of oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges she gave away to her mom and sister.
Oranges given to mom = 2 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges
Oranges given to sister = 2 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges
Total oranges given away = 40 + 40 = 80 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges remaining after giving away the 4 boxes.
Remaining oranges = Total oranges - Oranges

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
   * Each box contains 20 oranges.
   * So the total number of oranges she bought is:
     * 12 boxes x 20 oranges/box = 240 oranges

2. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
   * 2 boxes + 2 boxes = 4 boxes
   * 4 boxes x 20 oranges/box = 80 oranges given away

3. She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
   * Total oranges bought - oranges given away = 240 - 80 = 160 oranges remaining
   * 1/4 of 160 oranges = 40 oranges kept

4. She sold the rest of the oranges.
   * Total oranges bought - oranges given away - oranges kept = 160 - 40 = 120 oranges sold

Therefore, the number of oranges Mrs.
