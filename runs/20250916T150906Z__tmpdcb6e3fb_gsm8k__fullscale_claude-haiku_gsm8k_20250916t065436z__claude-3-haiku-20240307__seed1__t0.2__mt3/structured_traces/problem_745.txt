To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Mark generated from selling the cards and then subtract the cost of the packs he bought.

Given information:
- Mark bought 3 packs of old magic cards for $1800 each.
- He got 1 card worth $4000 and another card worth $1000.
- There are 30 more cards worth an average of $50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cards.
Revenue from the $4000 card = $4000
Revenue from the $1000 card = $1000
Revenue from the 30 cards worth an average of $50 each = 30 × $50 = $1500
Total revenue = $4000 + $1000 + $1500 = $6500

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the packs.
Cost of 3 packs = 3 × $1800 = $5400

Step 3: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $6500 - $5400 = $1100

Therefore,
