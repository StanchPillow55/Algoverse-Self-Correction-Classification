To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Scarlett purchased.

Given information:
- Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.
- She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each.
- She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.
- She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
- She bought fish food that cost $2.00.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the rocks.
Cost of 2 bags of rocks = 2 × $2.50 = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the coral.
Cost of 3 pieces of coral = 3 × $2.00 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fish.
Cost of 20 fish = 20 × $0.50 = $10.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
Total cost =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Aquarium cost: $10.00
2. Rocks:
   - 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - Total cost for rocks: 2 x $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral:
   - 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - Total cost for coral: 3 x $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish:
   - 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - Total cost for fish: 20 x $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Aquarium: $10.00
Rocks: $5.00
Coral: $6.00
Fish: $10.00
Fish food: $2.00

Total amount spent: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

Therefore, the total
