Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Hannah's house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
Total fireworks set off by the city = 15 boxes × 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Step 2: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display.
Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks = 0.40 × 300 = 120 fireworks

Step 3: Calculate the number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard.
Fireworks set off in Hannah's backyard = 3 boxes × 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see.
Total fireworks Hannah will see = Fireworks from city

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:
   * 15 boxes x 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks set off by the city

2. Hannah's house can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
   * 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.4 x 300 = 120 fireworks

3. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard:
   * 3 boxes x 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

4. To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:
   * Fireworks from the city: 120
   * Fireworks from her backyard: 15
   * Total fireworks: 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135.
