Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
- They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.
- The restaurant is open 2 days a week.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue per night.
Revenue per night = (2 meals × $5 per meal) + $5 bottle of wine
Revenue per night = ($10 + $5) = $15

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue per week.
Total revenue per week = Revenue per night × Number of days open per week
Total revenue per week = $15 × 2 days = $30
