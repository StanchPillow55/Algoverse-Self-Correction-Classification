Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.
- Carol spends half that much time recording the song.
- Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent recording the song.
Time spent recording = 1/2 × 4 hours = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total work time.
Total work time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total work time = 4 hours + 2 hours + 1.5 hours = 7.5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of total work time spent editing.
Time spent editing = 1.5 hours
Percentage of total work time spent editing = (Time spent editing / Total work time) × 100%
Percentage of total work time spent editing = (1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) × 100%
Percentage of total work time spent editing = 0.2 × 100% = 20%

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total
