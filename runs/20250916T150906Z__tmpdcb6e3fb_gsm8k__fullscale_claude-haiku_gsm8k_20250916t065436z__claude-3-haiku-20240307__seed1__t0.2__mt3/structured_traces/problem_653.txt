To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between Sally's expected weekly wage and the actual amount that was deposited into her bank account.

Given information:
- Sally's bank account held $200 at the start of the week.
- Sally's bank account now holds $420.
- Sally's weekly wage should be $300.
- Sally has received no other money into her bank account this week.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount that was deposited into Sally's bank account this week.
Total amount deposited = Ending balance - Starting balance
Total amount deposited = $420 - $200 = $220

Step 2: Calculate the difference between Sally's expected weekly wage and the actual amount deposited.
Amount withheld from Sally's wage = Expected weekly wage - Total amount deposited
Amount withheld from Sally's wage = $300 - $220 = $80

Therefore, $80 were withheld from Sally's wage this week.

Final answer: $80 were withheld from Sally's wage.
