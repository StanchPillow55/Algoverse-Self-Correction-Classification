Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes was 37 centimeters.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
- Then the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the length of the red rope.

The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:
6x + 7 = 37
6x = 30
x = 5

Therefore, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

Now, we can calculate the length of the red rope:
Length of the red rope = 4 ×

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes was 37 centimeters.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
- Then the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.

Step 1: Write an equation for the combined length of the 3 ropes.
Combined length = Length of red rope + Length of blue rope + Length of yellow rope
37 = 4x + x + (x + 7)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
37 = 6x + 7

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
37 - 7 = 6x
30 = 6x
x = 5 centimeters

Step 4: Calculate the length of the red rope

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes was 37 centimeters.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
- Then the length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.
- The length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.

Step 1: Find the combined length of the 3 ropes.
Combined length = Length of blue rope + Length of yellow rope + Length of red rope
37 = x + (x + 7) + 4x
37 = 6x + 7

Step 2: Solve for the length of the blue rope (x).
6x + 7 = 37
6x = 30
x = 5

Step 3: Find the length of the red rope.
Length of red rope = 4x = 4 ×
