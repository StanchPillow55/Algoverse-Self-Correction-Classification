To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has after receiving the gifts from her friend, the baby shower, and her mom.

Given information:
- Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
- Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits at her baby shower.
- Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new baby outfits Laurel received at her baby shower.
Number of new baby outfits from the baby shower = 2 Ã— 24 = 48 outfits

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baby outfits Laurel has.
Total number of baby outfits = Baby outfits from friend + New baby outfits from baby shower + Baby outfits from mom
Total number of baby outfits = 24 + 48 + 15 = 87 outfits

Therefore, Laurel has a total of 87 baby outfits.

Final answer: Laurel has 87 baby out
