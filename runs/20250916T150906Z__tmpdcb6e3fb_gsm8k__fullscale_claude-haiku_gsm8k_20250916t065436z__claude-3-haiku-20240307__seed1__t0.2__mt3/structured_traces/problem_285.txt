Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ann is 9 years old.
- Ann's brother is twice her age.

Step 1: Find the current age of Ann's brother.
Ann's age = 9 years
Ann's brother's age = 2 × Ann's age
Ann's brother's age = 2 × 9 = 18 years

Step 2: Find the age of Ann's brother in 3 years.
Ann's brother's age in 3 years = Ann's brother's current age + 3 years
Ann's brother's age in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years

Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.
