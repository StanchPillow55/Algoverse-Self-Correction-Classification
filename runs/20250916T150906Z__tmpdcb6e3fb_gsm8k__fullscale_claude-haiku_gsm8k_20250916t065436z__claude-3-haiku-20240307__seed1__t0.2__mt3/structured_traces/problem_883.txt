To solve this problem, we need to find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts.

Given information:
- Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
- The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
- The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the duration of the final concert without the encore.
Total runtime of the final concert - Duration of the encore = Duration of the final concert without the encore
65 minutes - 15 minutes = 50 minutes

Step 2: Find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts.
Since the final concert is twice as long as the usual concerts, we can divide the duration of the final concert without the encore by 2 to find the duration of the usual concerts.
50 minutes รท 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Final answer: Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.
