To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.
- After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing fairies.
- 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fairies that joined the existing ones.
Half of the initial number of fairies seen by Katelyn = 50 รท 2 = 25 fairies
Total number of fairies after the additional 25 joined = 50 + 25 = 75 fairies

Step 2: Calculate the number of fairies that flew away 10 minutes later.
Number of fairies that flew away = 30

Step 3: Calculate the number of fairies remaining.
Number of fairies remaining = Total number of fairies after the additional 25 joined - Number of fairies that flew away
Number of fairies remaining = 75 - 30 =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.

2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing fairies.
   * Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially.
   * Half of 50 is 25.
   * So, 25 more fairies joined the existing 50 fairies.
   * The total number of fairies is now 50 + 25 = 75.

3. 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   * The total number of fairies was 75.
   * 30 fairies flew away.
   * The remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the final answer is 45 fairies remaining.
