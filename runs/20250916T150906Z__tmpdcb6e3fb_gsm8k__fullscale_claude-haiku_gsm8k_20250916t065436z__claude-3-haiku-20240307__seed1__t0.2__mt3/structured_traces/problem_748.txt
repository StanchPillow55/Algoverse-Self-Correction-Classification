Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
- Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 1: Find how many marbles Cal has.
Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can use the following equation:
Sean's marbles = 1/2 × Cal's marbles

Therefore, Carl an
