Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- There are half as many robots as helmets.
- There are half as many helmets as footballs.
- There are 20 helmets.

Step 1: Find the number of robots.
Since there are half as many robots as helmets, we can use the following equation:
Number of robots = 1/2 × Number of helmets
Number of robots = 1/2 × 20 = 10 robots

Step 2: Find the number of footballs.
Since there are half as many helmets as footballs, we can use the following equation:
Number of footballs = 2 × Number of helmets
Number of footballs = 2 × 20 = 40 footballs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.
Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70 items

Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw in the changing room is
