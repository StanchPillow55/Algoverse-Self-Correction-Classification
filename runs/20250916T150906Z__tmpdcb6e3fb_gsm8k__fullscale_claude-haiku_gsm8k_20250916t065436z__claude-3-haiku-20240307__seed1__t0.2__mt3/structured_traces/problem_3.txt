To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of meters James runs in a week.

Given information:
- James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week.
- Each sprint is 60 meters.

Step 1: Find the total number of meters James runs per sprint.
Meters per sprint = 60 meters

Step 2: Find the total number of meters James runs per session (3 sprints).
Meters per session = 3 sprints × 60 meters per sprint = 180 meters

Step 3: Find the total number of meters James runs per week (3 sessions per week).
Meters per week = 3 sessions per week × 180 meters per session = 540 meters

Therefore, James runs a total of 540 meters per week.

Final answer: James runs a total of 540 meters per week.
