Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.
- This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate the increase in enrollment and add it to the original number of students.

Step 1: Calculate the increase in enrollment.
Increase in enrollment = 20% of 50 students
Increase in enrollment = 0.20 Ã— 50 = 10 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students enrolled this year.
Total students enrolled this year = Original number of students + Increase in enrollment
Total students enrolled this year = 50 + 10 = 60 students

Therefore, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.

Final answer: 60 students
