Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janeth borrowed $2000.
- She promised to return the $2000 with an additional 10% of the amount.
- She will pay $165 a month for 12 months.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back.
Original amount borrowed: $2000
Additional 10% of the amount: 0.10 × $2000 = $200
Total amount to be paid back: $2000 + $200 = $2200

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over the 12 months.
Monthly payment: $165
Total payments over 12 months: $165 × 12 = $1980

Step 3: Calculate Janeth's remaining balance.
Total amount to be paid back: $2200
Total payments made: $1980
Remaining balance: $2200 - $1980 = $220

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months of paying $165 per month will be $220.
