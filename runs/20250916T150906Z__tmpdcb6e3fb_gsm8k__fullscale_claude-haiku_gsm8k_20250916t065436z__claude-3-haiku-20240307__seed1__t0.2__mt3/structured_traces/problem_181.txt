To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red roses that Fred must deliver to keep Sandra's business.

Given information:
- Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
- Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of white carnations.
- Then, the number of red roses is 4x.
- The number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up an equation:
5x = 200
x = 40

Now, we can find the number of red roses:
Number of red roses = 4x = 4 Ã— 40 = 160

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. We define the variables: x is the number of white carnations, 4x is the number of red roses, and 5x is the number of pink calla lilies.
2.
