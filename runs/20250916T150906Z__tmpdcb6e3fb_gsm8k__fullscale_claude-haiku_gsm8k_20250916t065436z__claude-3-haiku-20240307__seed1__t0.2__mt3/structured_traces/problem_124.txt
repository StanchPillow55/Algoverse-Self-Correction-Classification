Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
- Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
- After Jennie puts stamps on some of the letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Step 1: Calculate how many letters Jennie stamped.

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie added the 20 letters.
Number of letters in the already-stamped pile after Jennie added 20 = 30 letters

Step 3: Calculate the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie added the 20 letters.
Number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie added 20 = 30 - 20 = 10 letters

Therefore, the number of letters in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began was
