To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Given information:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin.
Anakin's catch:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Step 2: Calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin.
Locsin's catch:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 +

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Anakin caught:
  - 10 starfish
  - 6 sea horses
  - 3 clownfish
- Locsin caught:
  - 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
  - 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
  - 2 more clownfish than Anakin

Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer.
Locsin's starfish = 10 - 5 = 5 starfish

Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer.
Locsin's sea horses = 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses 

Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more.

- Locsin caught:
  - 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
  - 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
  - 2 more clownfish than Anakin

Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.

Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more, so Locsin caught 3
