To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
2. Determine the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes.
3. Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes.
4. Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the added cream.
5. Add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening of the iced coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
* Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
* To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Step 2: Determine the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes.
* Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
* With 5 ice cubes, the total volume of the coffee is reduced by 5 × 12 = 60 milliliters.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
- Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
- Any added liquid also weakens the coffee.
- Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees.
- Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
Number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Step 2: Calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes.
Weakening due to ice cubes = 5 ice cubes × 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

Step 3: Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the added cream.
Weakening due to cream = 15 milliliters

Step 4: Calculate the total weakening of the coffee.
Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
