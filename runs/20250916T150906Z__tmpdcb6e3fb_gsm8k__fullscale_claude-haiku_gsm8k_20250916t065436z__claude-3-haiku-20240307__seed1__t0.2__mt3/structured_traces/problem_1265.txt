To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lemons Tim will need to make the lemonade for the party, including the extra gallon with twice the tartness.

Given information:
- For 1 gallon of lemonade, the recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
- 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
- Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
- Tim's best friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart as the other gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons needed for the 4 gallons of lemonade.
Number of cups of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons = 4 gallons × 1 cup/gallon = 4 cups

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tim's recipe for 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
2. 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
3. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   * For 4 gallons, he will need 4 cups of lemon juice.
   * Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 4 x 6 = 24 lemons for the 4 gallons.
4. Tim's best friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart.
   * This means the extra gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   * Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the extra gallon will require 2 x 6 = 12 lemons.

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
* 24 lemons for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the party
*
