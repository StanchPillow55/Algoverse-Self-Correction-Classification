Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 30 students in the class.
- Each lollipop costs $0.8 to sell.
- On average, each student sold 10 lollipops.
- The class bought the lollipops for $0.5 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops sold.
Total number of lollipops sold = Number of students × Average number of lollipops sold per student
Total number of lollipops sold = 30 × 10 = 300 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.
Total revenue = Total number of lollipops sold × Selling price per lollipop
Total revenue = 300 × $0.8 = $240

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of buying the lollipops.
Total cost = Total number of lollipops sold × Cost price per lollipop
Total cost = 300 × $0.5 = $150
