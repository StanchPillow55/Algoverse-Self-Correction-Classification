Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the cost of each item:
   * 5 croissants at $3.00 each = $15.00
   * 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = $10.00
   * 3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = $12.00
   * 13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = $13.00

2. Add up the total cost of all the items:
   * $15.00 + $10.00 + $12.00 + $13.00 = $50.00

3. Apply the 10% discount:
   * 10% of $50.00 = $5.00
   * $50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00

Therefore, Marcus' total bill after the 10% discount is $45.00.
