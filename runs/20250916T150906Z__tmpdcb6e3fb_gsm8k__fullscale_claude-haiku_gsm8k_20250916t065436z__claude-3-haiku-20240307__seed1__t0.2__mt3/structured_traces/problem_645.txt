Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each.

To find the total amount of flour in three bags, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the total amount of flour in one bag.
Total flour in one bag = Number of portions × Weight of each portion
Total flour in one bag = 8 × 2 kg = 16 kg

Step 2: Find the total amount of flour in three bags.
Total flour in three bags = Total flour in one bag × Number of bags
Total flour in three bags = 16 kg × 3 = 48 kg

Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags, before it was divided into portions, is 48 kilograms.

Final answer: 48 kilograms
