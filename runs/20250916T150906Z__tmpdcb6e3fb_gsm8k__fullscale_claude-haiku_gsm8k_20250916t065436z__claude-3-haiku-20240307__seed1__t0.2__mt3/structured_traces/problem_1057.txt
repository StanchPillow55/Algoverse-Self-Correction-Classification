Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.
- They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday.
- They watch movies every weekend.

Step 1: Calculate the number of movies watched on Sunday.
Movies watched on Saturday = 4
Movies watched on Sunday = 4 รท 2 = 2

Step 2: Calculate the total number of movies watched in a weekend.
Movies watched on Saturday + Movies watched on Sunday = 4 + 2 = 6 movies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weeks.
Movies watched in a weekend = 6
Number of weekends in 4 weeks = 4
Total movies watched in 4 weeks = 6 movies ร 4 weekends = 24 movies

Therefore, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

Final answer: 24 movies
