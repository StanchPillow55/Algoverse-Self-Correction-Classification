Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jigsaw puzzle has 1000 pieces.
- Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
- Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate how many pieces Poppy placed on the board.
A quarter of 1000 pieces = 1000 รท 4 = 250 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces are left after Poppy places her pieces.
Total pieces - Pieces placed by Poppy = Remaining pieces
1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

Step 3: Calculate how many pieces Poppy's mom placed on the board.
A third of 750 pieces = 750 รท 3 = 250 pieces

Step 4: Calculate how many pieces are left to be placed.
Remaining pieces - Pieces placed by Poppy's mom = Pieces left to be placed
750 - 250 = 500 pieces

Therefore, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left
