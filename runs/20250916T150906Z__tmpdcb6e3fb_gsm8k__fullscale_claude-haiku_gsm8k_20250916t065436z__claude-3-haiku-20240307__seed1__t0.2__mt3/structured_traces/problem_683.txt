To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Chris to mow the lawn by using both the "turtle" mode and the "rabbit" mode.

Given information:
- In "turtle" mode, it takes Chris 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn.
- In "rabbit" mode, it takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- Today, Chris mowed half the lawn in "turtle" mode and the other half in "rabbit" mode.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode = 1/2 × 60 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode = 1/2 × 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
Total time = Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode + Time to mow half the

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chris has a two-speed lawn mower
- In "turtle" mode, it takes him 1 hour to mow the entire lawn
- In "rabbit" mode, it takes him 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn
- Today, he mowed half the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in turtle mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in turtle mode = 1 hour / 2 = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to mow the entire lawn by adding the time for each mode.
Total time = Time in turtle mode + Time in rabbit mode
Total time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes

Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the entire lawn by mowing half in
