To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tomatoes Steve needs per week and then calculate the number of vines required to meet his weekly demand.

Given information:
- Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve needs per week.
Steve's daily tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes
Steve's weekly tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes × 7 days = 42 tomatoes

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve's girlfriend needs per week.
Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend's daily tomato consumption = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 tomatoes
His girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption = 3 tomatoes × 7 days = 21 tomatoes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend need per week.
Total weekly tomato consumption = Steve's weekly tomato consumption + His girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption
Total weekly tomato consumption =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 1: Calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats per week.
Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
Number of days in a week = 7
Total tomatoes eaten per week = 6 tomatoes/day × 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Step 2: Calculate how many tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week.
Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as him.
Girlfriend's tomatoes per week = 42 tomatoes/week ÷ 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes needed per week.
Total tomatoes needed per week = Steve's tomatoes per week + Girlfriend's tomatoes per week
Total tomatoes needed per week = 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat per week.
Total weekly tomato consumption = Steve's weekly tomato consumption + Girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption
Total weekly tomato consumption = 42 tomatoes + 21 tomatoes = 63 tomatoes

Step 4: Calculate the number of vines needed to produce the required number of tomatoes per week.
