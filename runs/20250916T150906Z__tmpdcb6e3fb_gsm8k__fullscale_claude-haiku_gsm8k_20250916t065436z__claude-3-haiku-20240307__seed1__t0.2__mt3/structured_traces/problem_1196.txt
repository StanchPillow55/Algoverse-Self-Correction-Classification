Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
- Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
- Each pack has 5 pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red pens.
Number of red pens = Number of packs × Number of pens per pack
Number of red pens = 5 × 5 = 25 red pens

Step 2: Calculate the number of black pens.
Number of black pens = 2 × Number of red pens
Number of black pens = 2 × 25 = 50 black pens

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens Alain has.
Total number of pens = Number of red pens + Number of black pens
Total number of pens = 25 + 50 = 75 pens

Therefore, Alain has a total of 75 pens.

Final answer: Alain has 75 pens.
