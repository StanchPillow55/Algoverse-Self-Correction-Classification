To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, considering the given information.

Given information:
- Josh spent 4 hours working out every week, except on some occasions.
- At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
- Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the weeks where he spent 4 hours.
Number of weeks where he spent 4 hours = 8 weeks - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks
Total hours spent working out in the 5 weeks = 5 weeks × 4 hours = 20 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours.
Total hours spent working out in the two consecutive weeks = 2 weeks × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the one week where he spent 6 hours.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Josh worked out for 8 weeks.
- Typically, he spent 4 hours working out every week.
- At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
- Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours for the typical 4 hours per week.
Typical hours per week: 4 hours
Total weeks: 8 weeks
Total typical hours = 4 hours × 8 weeks = 32 hours

Step 2: Calculate the hours for the two consecutive weeks of 5 hours each.
Hours for those two weeks = 5 hours × 2 weeks = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the hours for the one week of 6 hours.
Hours for that week = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total hours by adding up the hours from the three different scenarios.
Total hours = Typical hours + Hours for two 5-hour weeks + Hours for one 6-hour week
Total hours = 32

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Josh tracked his workout routine for 8 weeks.
- He spent 4 hours working out every week, except on some occasions.
- At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
- Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to calculate the hours for each week and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours working out.
Number of weeks with 4 hours = 8 weeks - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks
Total hours for 5 weeks = 5 weeks × 4 hours = 20 hours

Step 2: Calculate the hours for the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours.
Total hours for 2 weeks = 2 weeks × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the hours for the
