To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.

Given information:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.
- There are 16 weeks of school in one semester.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Number of classes per day × Number of hours per class × Number of days per week = Total hours per week
3 × 1 hour × 3 days = 9 hours per week

Total hours for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in one semester = 9 hours per week × 16 weeks = 144 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Number of classes per day × Number of hours per class × Number of days per

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes that are each 1 hour long.
   * So on those days, he spends 3 hours in class.
   * There are 3 days per week like this, so that's 3 hours x 3 days = 9 hours per week.

2. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes that are each 2 hours long.
   * So on those days, he spends 4 hours in class.
   * There are 2 days per week like this, so that's 4 hours x 2 days = 8 hours per week.

3. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.
   * For the Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes, that's 9 hours per week x 16 weeks = 144 hours.
   * For the Tuesday/Thursday classes, that's 8 hours per week x 16 weeks = 128

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.
- There are 16 weeks in one semester.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Number of classes per day = 3
Duration of each class = 1 hour
Number of days per week = 3 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
Total hours per week = 3 classes × 1 hour × 3 days = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Number of classes per day = 2
Duration of each class = 2 hours
Number of days per week = 2 (Tuesday, Thursday)
Total hours per week = 2 classes × 2 hours
