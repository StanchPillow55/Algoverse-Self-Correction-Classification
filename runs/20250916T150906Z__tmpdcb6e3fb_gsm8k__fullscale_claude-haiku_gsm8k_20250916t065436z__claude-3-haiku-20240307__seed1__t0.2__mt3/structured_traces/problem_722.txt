To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and compare it to the cost of the damage to Ron's car if he doesn't fix it.

Given information:
- The damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.
- The city council will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself.
- Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole.
Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt = 3 Ã— $25 = $75
Fine for unauthorized road maintenance = $120
Total cost of fixing the pothole = $75 + $120 = $195

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Ron saves by fixing the pothole.
Amount of money saved = Cost of damage to car - Total cost of fixing the pothole
Amount of money saved = $450 - $195 = $255

Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.

Final answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.
