To solve this problem, we need to find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought at the market.

Given information:
- Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
- Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.

Step 1: Find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
Since Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can divide the number of onions and potatoes Rose bought by 4 to find the number Sophia bought.

Number of onions Sophia bought = 12 รท 4 = 3 onions
Number of potatoes Sophia bought = 4 รท 4 = 1 potato

Step 2: Find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought.
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = Number of onions Sophia bought + Number of potatoes Sophia bought
Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought = 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes
