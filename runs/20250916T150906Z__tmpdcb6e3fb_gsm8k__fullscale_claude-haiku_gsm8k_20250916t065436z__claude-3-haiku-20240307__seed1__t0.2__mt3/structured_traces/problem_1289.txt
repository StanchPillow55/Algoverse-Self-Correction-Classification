Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Small t-shirt = 3 square feet of fabric
- Medium t-shirt = 4 square feet of fabric
- Large t-shirt = 6 square feet of fabric
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts

To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the area contributed by the small t-shirts.
Area of small t-shirts = 11 shirts × 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area contributed by the medium t-shirts.
Area of medium t-shirts = 8 shirts × 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the area contributed by the large t-shirts.
Area of large t-shirts = 6 shirts × 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the total area of the quilt.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts, each of which is 3 square feet of fabric.
   * 11 small t-shirts x 3 square feet per t-shirt = 33 square feet

2. Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts, each of which is 4 square feet of fabric.
   * 8 medium t-shirts x 4 square feet per t-shirt = 32 square feet

3. Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts, each of which is 6 square feet of fabric.
   * 6 large t-shirts x 6 square feet per t-shirt = 36 square feet

4. To calculate the total square feet of the quilt, we add up the areas of the small, medium, and large t-shirts:
   * 33 square feet + 32 square feet + 36 square feet = 101 square feet

Therefore, the total square feet of the quilt is 101 square feet.
