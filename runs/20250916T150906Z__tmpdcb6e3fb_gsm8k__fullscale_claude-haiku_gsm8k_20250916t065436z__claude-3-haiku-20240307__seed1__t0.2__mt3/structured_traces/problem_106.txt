Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- John has 3 boxes.
- Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches.
- The walls of each box are 1 inch thick.

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Height = 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length = 5 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 3 inches
- Width = 6 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 4 inches
- Height = 4 inches - 1 inch (wall thickness) - 1 inch (wall thickness) = 2 inches

Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of each box.
Inner volume of each box = Length × Width × Height

To find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes, we need to:
1. Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
2. Calculate the inner volume of each box.
3. Multiply the inner volume of each box by 3 to get the total inner volume of all 3 boxes.

Step 1: Calculate the inner dimensions of each box.
Outer dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches
- Width: 6 inches
- Height: 4 inches

Inner dimensions of each box:
- Length: 5 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 3 inches
- Width: 6 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 4 inches
- Height: 4 inches - (1 inch × 2) = 2 inches
