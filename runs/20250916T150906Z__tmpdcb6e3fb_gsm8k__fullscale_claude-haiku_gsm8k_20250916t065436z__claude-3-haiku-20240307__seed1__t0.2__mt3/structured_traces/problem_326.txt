To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

Given information:
- At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.
- There were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

Let's call the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as "x".

Step 1: Find the number of people on the bus after the first bus stop.
Number of people on the bus after the first bus stop = x + 5

Step 2: Find the number of people on the bus after the second bus stop.
Number of people on the bus after the second bus stop = (x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the value of "x".
Total number of people heading to the third stop = x + 6
20 = x + 6
x = 14

Therefore, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.

Final answer: 14 people
