To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cards Miss Maria has and then divide it by the number of cards each student received to find the number of students.

Given information:
- Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with 25 cards in each deck.
- Miss Maria has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with 40 cards in each box.
- Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself.
- Each student receives 10 cards.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards.
Number of basketball cards = 6 decks × 25 cards per deck = 150 basketball cards

Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards.
Number of baseball cards = 5 boxes × 40 cards per box = 200 baseball cards

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has.
Total number of cards = Number of basketball cards + Number of baseball cards
Total number of cards = 150 + 200 = 350 cards

Step 4: Subtract the 50 cards Miss Maria keeps for herself.
Number of cards to be given to students =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Miss Maria has 6 decks of 25 basketball cards each:
   * 6 decks x 25 cards per deck = 150 basketball cards

2. Miss Maria has 5 boxes of 40 baseball cards each:
   * 5 boxes x 40 cards per box = 200 baseball cards

3. The total number of cards Miss Maria has is:
   * 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are:
   * 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

5. Each student gets 10 cards, so to find the number of students:
   * 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students

Therefore, the final answer is that Miss Maria has 30 students.
