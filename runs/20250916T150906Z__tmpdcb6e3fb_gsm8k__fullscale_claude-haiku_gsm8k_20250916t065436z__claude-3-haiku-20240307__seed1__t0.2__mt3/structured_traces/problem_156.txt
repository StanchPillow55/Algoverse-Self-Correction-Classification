Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.
- The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total monthly requirement and then multiply it by 2.

Step 1: Calculate the total monthly requirement.
Monkeys' monthly requirement = 200 bananas
Gorillas' monthly requirement = 400 bananas
Baboons' monthly requirement = 100 bananas
Total monthly requirement = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Step 2: Calculate the total requirement for 2 months.
Total requirement for 2 months = Total monthly requirement × 2
Total requirement for 2 months = 700 bananas × 2 = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know the following:
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month
   - The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months

2. To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to add up the monthly requirements for each type of ape and multiply by 2 months.

   Monkeys: 200 bananas/month x 2 months = 400 bananas
   Gorillas: 400 bananas/month x 2 months = 800 bananas
   Baboons: 100 bananas/month x 2 months = 200 bananas

3. Now we add up the total bananas needed for all the apes:
   400 + 800 + 200 = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for 2 months.
