Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elijah has two dogs.
- One of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
- The other of Elijah's dogs is half the weight of Kory's dog.
- Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog.
Elijah's first dog = 1/4 of Kory's dog
Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog weighs = 1/4 × 60 pounds = 15 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog.
Elijah's second dog = 1/2 of Kory's dog
Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds
Elijah's second dog weighs = 1/2 × 60 pounds = 30 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of Elijah's two dogs.
Total weight of Elijah's dogs = Weight

- The other of Elijah's dogs is half the weight of Kory's dog.
- Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the first dog that Elijah has.
Weight of Elijah's first dog = 1/4 × Weight of Kory's dog
Weight of Elijah's first dog = 1/4 × 60 pounds = 15 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the second dog that Elijah has.
Weight of Elijah's second dog = 1/2 × Weight of Kory's dog
Weight of Elijah's second dog = 1/2 × 60 pounds = 30 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs.
Total weight of Elijah's dogs = Weight of first dog + Weight of second dog
