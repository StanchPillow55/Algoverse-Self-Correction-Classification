To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of bolts of fiber required to make the robe.

Given information:
- The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe takes half the amount of white fiber compared to blue fiber.

Step 1: Find the amount of white fiber required.
Amount of white fiber = 1/2 × Amount of blue fiber
Amount of white fiber = 1/2 × 2 bolts = 1 bolt

Step 2: Find the total number of bolts required.
Total number of bolts = Amount of blue fiber + Amount of white fiber
Total number of bolts = 2 bolts + 1 bolt = 3 bolts

Therefore, it takes a total of 3 bolts of fiber to make the robe.

Final answer: 3 bolts
