Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nani is 8 years old.
- Nani's brother is twice his age.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than him.

Step 1: Find the age of Nani's brother.
Nani's brother's age = 2 × Nani's age
Nani's brother's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Nani's sister.
Nani's sister's age = Nani's age - (Nani's age × 25%)
Nani's sister's age = 8 - (8 × 0.25) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total age of all three family members.
Total age = Nani's age + Nani's brother's age + Nani's sister's age
Total age = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old

Therefore, the total age of all
