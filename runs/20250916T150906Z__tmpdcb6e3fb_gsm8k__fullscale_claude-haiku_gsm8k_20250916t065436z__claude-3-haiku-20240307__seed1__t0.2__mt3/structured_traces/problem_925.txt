Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool.
- Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
- The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the tank.
Amount of water in the tank = 1/2 × 10,000 gallons = 5,000 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.
Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount of water - (Rate of water usage × Number of days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - (500 gallons/day × 6 days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

Final answer: 2,

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * To find the amount of water in the tank, we divide the total water in the pool by 2:
   * 10,000 gallons ÷ 2 = 5,000 gallons

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.
4. We need to find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.

To calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water used each day from the initial amount of water in the tank.

* Initial amount of water in the tank: 5,000 gallons
* Amount of water used per day: 500 gallons
* Number of days: 6

Calculation:
* Amount of water used in 6 days = 500 gallons/day × 6 days = 3,000 gallons

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * Half of 10,000 gallons is 5,000 gallons.
   * So the tank is filled with 5,000 gallons of water.

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
4. We need to find how many gallons will be remaining in the tank after 6 days.
   * After 1 day, 500 gallons will be used, leaving 5,000 - 500 = 4,500 gallons.
   * After 2 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,500 - 500 = 4,000 gallons.
   * After 3 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,000 - 500 = 3,500 gallons.
   * After 4 days, another
