To solve this problem, we need to find the total annual electricity cost and then divide it equally among the 5 roommates (Jenna and her 4 roommates).

Given information:
- The monthly electricity bill is $100.
- Jenna has 4 roommates.

Step 1: Calculate the total annual electricity cost.
Total annual electricity cost = Monthly electricity bill × 12 months
Total annual electricity cost = $100 × 12 = $1,200

Step 2: Calculate the share of the electricity cost for each roommate.
Total number of roommates = Jenna + 4 roommates = 5 people
Share of electricity cost per roommate = Total annual electricity cost / Total number of roommates
Share of electricity cost per roommate = $1,200 / 5 = $240

Therefore, each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity if they divide the share equally.

Final answer:
Each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.
