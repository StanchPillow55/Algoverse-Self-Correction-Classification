To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of brownies Greta had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten during the day.

Given information:
- Greta made a batch of one dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
- At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.
- At her surprise party, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had.
Total brownies = Brownies made + Brownies from office party + Brownies from surprise party
Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Step 2: Calculate the number of brownies eaten during the day.
Brownies eaten = 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies left over.
Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greta made a batch of 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
- At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.
- At her surprise party at home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day.
Brownies from her own batch + Brownies from office party + Brownies from home party
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66 brownies

Step 2: Calculate the number of brownies eaten during the day.
Brownies eaten during the party = 18

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies Greta had left over.
Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48 brownies

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.

2. At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.

3. At the surprise party at home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day:
* Brownies made for herself: 12
* Brownies from office party: 6
* Brownies at home party: 48

Total brownies: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Now, let's calculate how many brownies were eaten:
* Brownies eaten at party: 18

Finally, we can calculate the number of brownies Greta had left over:
* Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
* Brownies left over = 66
