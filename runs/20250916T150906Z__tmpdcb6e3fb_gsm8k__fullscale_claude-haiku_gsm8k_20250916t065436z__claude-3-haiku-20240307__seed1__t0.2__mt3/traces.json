Now they make silos:\n   * They sell 5 silos per day\n   * They make $220 per silo\n   * Daily revenue = 5 silos x $220 per silo = $1,100 per day\n\n3. To calculate the percentage increase:\n   * Increase in daily revenue = $1,100 - $1,000 = $100\n   * Percentage increase = (Increase in daily revenue) / (Original daily revenue) x 100\n   * = ($100) / ($1,000) x 100\n   * = 0.10 x 100\n   * = 10%\n\nTherefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that they are making silos instead of tractors."

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.\n4. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how much Peter spent on the wooden action figures:\n* 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) x $5 per figure = $20 spent on wooden figures\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money Peter has left to spend on the plastic action figures:\n* $70 total - $20 spent on wooden figures = $50 remaining\n\nSince the plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can divide the remaining $50 by $2 to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy:\n* $50 / $2 per figure = 25 plastic action figures\n\nTherefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:\n* 4 wooden action"

James gets 80 emails a day.\n2. 20% of those emails don't require any response.\n   * To find 20% of 80 emails:\n   * 20% of 80 = 0.20 x 80 = 16 emails\n   * So, 16 emails per day don't require a response.\n3. He responds to the rest of the emails.\n   * Total emails per day = 80\n   * Emails that don't require a response = 16\n   * Emails he responds to = 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.\n4. He works a 5 day work week.\n   * Emails responded to in 5 days = 64 emails/day x 5 days = 320 emails.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nJames responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week."

The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.\n   Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so the number of lines he has to memorize from the second scene is 60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.\n\n4.

This means the tree has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section).\n4. So the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of the wood would be:\n   * 20 sections x 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds\n\n5. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.\n6. To calculate the weight lost due to the termites, we take 30% of the total weight:\n   * 8,000 pounds x 0.30 = 2,400 pounds\n\n7. To get the final weight of the redwood tree, we subtract the weight lost from the original weight:\n   * 8,000 pounds - 2,400 pounds = 5,600 pounds\n\nTherefore, the final weight of the 200-foot tall redwood tree is 5,600 pounds."

Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts to surprise her friends.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of gifts Cherrie bought:\n* Gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each: 10 gifts\n* Gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each: 6 gifts\n* Additional 10 random gifts: 10 gifts\n\nTotal gifts bought = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts\n\nTherefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26."

We know that the prices are proportional, which means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all three packages.\n\n3. To find the cost per sandwich, we can use the information from the first two packages:\n   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3, so the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50\n   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6, so the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50\n\n4.

He pays an additional $1,000 for registration on each car.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of the 12 cars before tax and registration:\n* 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000\n\nNext, let's calculate the 10% tax on the $240,000:\n* 10% of $240,000 = $24,000\n\nNow, let's calculate the total registration fees for the 12 cars:\n* 12 cars x $1,000 per car = $12,000\n\nFinally, we can add up the total cost:\n* Cost of cars: $240,000\n* Tax: $24,000\n* Registration fees: $12,000\n* Total: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000\n\nTherefore, the total amount Mark pays for"
