Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 175 diamonds in the treasure chest.
- There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
- There are twice the number of emeralds than the number of rubies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rubies.
Number of rubies = Number of diamonds - 35
Number of rubies = 175 - 35 = 140 rubies

Step 2: Calculate the number of emeralds.
Number of emeralds = 2 × Number of rubies
Number of emeralds = 2 × 140 = 280 emeralds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of gems in the treasure chest.
Total number of gems = Number of diamonds + Number of rubies + Number of emeralds
Total number of gems = 175 + 140 + 280 = 595 gems

Therefore, the total number of gems in the treasure chest is 595.

Final answer: There are 595 gems in the treasure chest.
