Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
2. She collects one shell every month.
3. We need to find how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

To calculate this, we need to find the number of months between when she started collecting (age 5) and her 10th birthday.

* Age 5 to age 10 is 5 years
* 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.

Final answer: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.
