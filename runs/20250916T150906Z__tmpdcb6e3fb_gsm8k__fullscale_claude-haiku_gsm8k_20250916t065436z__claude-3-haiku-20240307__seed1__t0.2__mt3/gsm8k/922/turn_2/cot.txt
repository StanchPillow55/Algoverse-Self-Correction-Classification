Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
2. Every month, she collects one shell.
3. We need to find out how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

To calculate this, we need to find the total number of months between when she started collecting (age 5) and her 10th birthday.

* From age 5 to age 10, there are 5 years.
* Each year has 12 months.
* So, the total number of months is 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell per month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is:

* 60 months x 1 shell/month = 60 shells

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.
