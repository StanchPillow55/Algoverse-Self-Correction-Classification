To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.

Given information:
- Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
- She collects one shell every month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of months between Martha's 5th birthday and her 10th birthday.
Number of years between 5th and 10th birthday = 10 - 5 = 5 years
Number of months between 5th and 10th birthday = 5 years Ã— 12 months/year = 60 months

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.
Total number of shells collected = Number of months between 5th and 10th birthday
Total number of shells collected = 60 shells

Therefore, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected 60 shells.

Final answer: Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.
