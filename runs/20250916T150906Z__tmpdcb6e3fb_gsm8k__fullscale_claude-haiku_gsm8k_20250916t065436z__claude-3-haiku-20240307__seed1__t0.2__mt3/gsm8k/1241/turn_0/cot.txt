Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rose bought 5 dozens of eggs for $2.40 per dozen.
- Rose will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs.
Total cost of the eggs = 5 dozens × $2.40 per dozen = $12.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Rose bought.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
5 dozens = 5 × 12 = 60 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue Rose will make from selling the eggs.
Number of eggs sold = 60 eggs
Price per 3 eggs = $1
Total revenue = (60 eggs ÷ 3 eggs per sale) × $1 per sale = 20 sales × $1 per sale = $20.00

Step 4: Calculate Rose's profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Rose's profit will be $8
