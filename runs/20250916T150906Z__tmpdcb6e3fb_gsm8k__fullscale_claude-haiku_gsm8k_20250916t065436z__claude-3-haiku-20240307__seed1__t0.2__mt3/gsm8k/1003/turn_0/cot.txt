To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the dance studio in a month.

Given information:
- Cost per session to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Number of days the studio is rented per week: 3
- Number of weeks in a month: 4 (assuming a standard month)

Step 1: Calculate the cost of renting the studio per week.
Cost of renting the studio per week = $25 per session × 3 days per week = $75 per week

Step 2: Calculate the cost per student per week.
Cost per student per week = $1.50 per student per session × 3 days per week = $4.50 per student per week

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per student per month.
Total cost per student per month = $4.50 per student per week × 4 weeks per month = $18 per student per month

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for all students per month.
Total cost for all students per month = $18 per student per month
