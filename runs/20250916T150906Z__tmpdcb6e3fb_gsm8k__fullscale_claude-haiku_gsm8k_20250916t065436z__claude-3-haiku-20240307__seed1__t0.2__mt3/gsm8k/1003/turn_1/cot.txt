Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cost per session to rent the studio: $25
- Cost per student per session: $1.50
- Number of students: 10
- Number of days the studio is rented per week: 3

To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to find the total revenue for the month.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue per session.
Total revenue per session = Studio rental cost + (Number of students × Cost per student)
Total revenue per session = $25 + (10 × $1.50) = $40

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue per week.
Total revenue per week = Total revenue per session × Number of days rented per week
Total revenue per week = $40 × 3 = $120

Step 3: Calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month.
Assuming a month has 4 weeks, the expected earnings in a month would be:
Expected earnings in a month = Total revenue per week × 4 weeks
Expected earnings in a month = $120 × 4
