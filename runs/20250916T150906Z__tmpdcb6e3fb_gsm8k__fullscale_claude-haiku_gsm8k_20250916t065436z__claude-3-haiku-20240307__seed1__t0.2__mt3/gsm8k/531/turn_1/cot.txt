Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of passengers on the bus: 48

2. First stop:
   - 8 passengers get off the bus
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus
   - Number of people who got on = 5 × 8 = 40
   - Number of passengers on the bus after the first stop = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80

3. Second stop:
   - 21 passengers get off the bus
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to the number who got off
   - Number of people who got on = (21 / 3) = 7
   - Number of passengers on the bus after the second stop = 80 - 21 + 7 = 66

Therefore, the final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.
