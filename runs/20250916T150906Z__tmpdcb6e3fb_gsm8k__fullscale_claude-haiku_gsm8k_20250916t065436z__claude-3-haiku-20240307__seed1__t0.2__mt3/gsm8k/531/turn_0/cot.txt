To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

Step 1: Calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop.
Number of passengers who got off at the first stop = 8
Number of passengers who got on at the first stop = 5 ร 8 = 40
Number of passengers on the bus after the first stop = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80

Step 2: Calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.
Number of passengers who got off at the second stop = 21
Number of passengers who got on at the second stop = 40 รท 3 = 13.33 (rounded down to 13)
Number of passengers on
