Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- The original planned price for each computer was $700.
- The actual price of each computer was 10% higher than the planned price.

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
Original planned price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 × $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid for the 500 computers.
Total amount paid = Number of computers × New price per computer
Total amount paid = 500 × $770 = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.
