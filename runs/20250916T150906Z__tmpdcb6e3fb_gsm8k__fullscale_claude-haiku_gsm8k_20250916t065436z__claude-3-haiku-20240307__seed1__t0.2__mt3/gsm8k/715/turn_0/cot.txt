To solve this problem, we need to find the new price of each computer and then calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers.

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- The company had $700 for each computer.
- The price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for.

Step 1: Calculate the new price of each computer.
Original price per computer = $700
Increase in price = 10% of $700 = 0.10 × $700 = $70
New price per computer = Original price + Increase in price
New price per computer = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers.
Total amount paid = Number of computers × New price per computer
Total amount paid = 500 × $770 = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.
