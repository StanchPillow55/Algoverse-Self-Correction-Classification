Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company wanted to buy 500 computers.
- They had budgeted $700 for each computer.
- The actual price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for.

Step 1: Calculate the original planned cost for 500 computers.
Original planned cost per computer = $700
Total original planned cost = 500 computers × $700 per computer = $350,000

Step 2: Calculate the new price of each computer after the 10% increase.
New price per computer = $700 + (10% of $700) = $700 + $70 = $770

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid for 500 computers at the new price.
Total amount paid = 500 computers × $770 per computer = $385,000

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to buy the 500 computers at the new prices is $385,000.
