Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
- Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.
- Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
- Walter's friend gives him an additional $200.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.
Total amount collected = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Step 2: Determine the amount the lawyer will contribute.
The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
Total amount donated by everyone else = $2000
Amount the lawyer will contribute = 3 Ã— $2000 = $6000

Therefore, the lawyer will contribute $6000 to Walter's charity.

Final answer: The lawyer will contribute $6000 to Walter's charity.
