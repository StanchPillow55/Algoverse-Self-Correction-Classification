To solve this problem, we need to find the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School.

Given information:
- The school currently enrolls 3000 students.
- Half of the students are over 16 years old.
- One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.
- The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
- One-half of the students under 16 years old are male.

Step 1: Find the number of students over 16 years old.
Number of students over 16 years old = 3000 Ã— 1/2 = 1500 students

Step 2: Find the number of male students over 16 years old.
Number of male students over 16 years old = 1500 Ã— 1/4 = 375 students

Step 3: Find the number of female students over 16 years old.
Number of female students over 16 years old = 1500 - 375 = 1125 students

Step 4: Find the number of students under 16 years old.
Number of students
