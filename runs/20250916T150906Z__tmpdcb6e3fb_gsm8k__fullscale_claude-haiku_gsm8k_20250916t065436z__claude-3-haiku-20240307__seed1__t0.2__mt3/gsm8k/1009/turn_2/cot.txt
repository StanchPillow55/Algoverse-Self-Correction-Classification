Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Total number of students: 3000

2. Half of the students are over 16 years old:
   * 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old

3. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male:
   * 1500 * 1/4 = 375 male students over 16 years old

4. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old:
   * 3000 / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old

5. One-half of the students under 16 are male:
   * 1500 * 1/2 = 750 male students under 16 years old

6. Total number of male students:
   * 375 (over 16 years old) + 750 (under 16 years old) = 1125 male students

7. Total number of female students:
   * 3000 - 1125 = 1875 female
