Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brittany's comforter has 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.
2. The comforter has 14 red squares.
3. The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   * So, the number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.
4. The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   * So, the number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.
5. The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   * So, the number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, to calculate the total square feet of the comforter:
* Each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, so each square is 1 square foot.
* The total number of squares is:
   * Red squares: 14
   * Blue squares: 18
   * Green squares: 24
   * White squares: 12
* Total squares
