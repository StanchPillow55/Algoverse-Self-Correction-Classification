To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of squares in the comforter and then multiply it by the size of each square (1 square foot) to get the total area of the comforter.

Given information:
- The comforter has 14 red squares.
- The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
- The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
- The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.

Step 1: Find the number of blue squares.
Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Find the number of green squares.
Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

Step 3: Find the number of white squares.
Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Step 4: Find the total number of squares in the
