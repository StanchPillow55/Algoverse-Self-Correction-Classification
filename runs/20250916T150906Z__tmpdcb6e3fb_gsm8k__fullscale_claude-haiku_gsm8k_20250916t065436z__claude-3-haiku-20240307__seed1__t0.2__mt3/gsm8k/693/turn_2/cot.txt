Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brittany's comforter has 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.
2. The comforter has:
   - 14 red squares
   - 4 more blue squares than red squares
   - 6 more green squares than blue squares
   - 12 fewer white squares than green squares

To find the total number of square feet in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue squares.
Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Calculate the number of green squares.
Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

Step 3: Calculate the number of white squares.
Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Step 4: Calculate the total number of squares in the comforter.
Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Step 5: Calculate the total square feet
