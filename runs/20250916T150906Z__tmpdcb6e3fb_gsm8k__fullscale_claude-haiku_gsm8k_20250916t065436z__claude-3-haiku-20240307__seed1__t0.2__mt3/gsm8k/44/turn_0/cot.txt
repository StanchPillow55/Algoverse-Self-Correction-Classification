Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
- 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.
- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00.
- Charlie makes and sells 20 candles.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of supplies for 20 candles.
Since 1 pound of beeswax can make 10 candles, we need 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.
Total cost of supplies = 2 pounds of beeswax × $10.00 per pound = $20.00

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.
Total revenue = 20 candles × $2.00 per candle = $40.00

Step 3: Calculate the net profit.
Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore
