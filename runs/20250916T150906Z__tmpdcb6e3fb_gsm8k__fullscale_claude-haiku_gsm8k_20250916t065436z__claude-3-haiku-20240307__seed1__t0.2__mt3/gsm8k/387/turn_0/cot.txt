Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cost of 1 eraser is $2.
- The cost of 1 pencil is $3.
- We need to find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 6 erasers.
Cost of 1 eraser = $2
Cost of 6 erasers = 6 × $2 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 pencils.
Cost of 1 pencil = $3
Cost of 8 pencils = 8 × $3 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.
Total cost = Cost of 6 erasers + Cost of 8 pencils
Total cost = $12 + $24 = $36

Therefore, the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils is $36.
