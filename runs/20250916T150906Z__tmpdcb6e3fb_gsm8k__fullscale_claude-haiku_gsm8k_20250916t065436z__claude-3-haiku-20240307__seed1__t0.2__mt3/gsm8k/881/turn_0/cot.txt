To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between Melanie's present age and the number of years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.

Given information:
- In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.

Step 1: Find Melanie's present age.
Melanie's age in 10 years - 10 years = Melanie's present age
18 years - 10 years = 8 years

Therefore, Melanie's present age is 8 years.

Step 2: Find the age when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.
Melanie's present age × 3 = Melanie's age when it is thrice her present age
8 years × 3 = 24 years

Step 3: Find the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.
Melanie's age when it is thrice her present age - Melanie's present age = Number of years
24 years - 8 years = 16 years

Therefore, it will
