Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.
- Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony.
- Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby.
- Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than Kathy.

Step 1: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Bobby can pick per hour.
Bobby's quarts per hour = Tony's quarts per hour - 1
Bobby's quarts per hour = 6 - 1 = 5 quarts

Step 2: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Kathy can pick per hour.
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × Bobby's quarts per hour
Kathy's quarts per hour = 2 × 5 = 10 quarts

Step 3: Calculate how many quarts of strawberries Ricky can pick per hour.
Ricky's quarts per hour = Kathy's quarts per hour -
