To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year and then add them up to find the total number of fruits produced during its 10 years of life.

Given information:
- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year.
Year 5: 50 fruits
Year 6: 3 × 50 = 150 fruits
Year 7: 7 × 50 = 350 fruits
Year 8:
