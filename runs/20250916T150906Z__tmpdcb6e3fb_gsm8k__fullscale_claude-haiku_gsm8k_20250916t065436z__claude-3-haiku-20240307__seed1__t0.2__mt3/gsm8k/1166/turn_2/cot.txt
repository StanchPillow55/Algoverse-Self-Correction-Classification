Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits
2. 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits
6. 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's go back to the 8-year-old tree. We know it produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
* 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits
* 8-year-old tree
