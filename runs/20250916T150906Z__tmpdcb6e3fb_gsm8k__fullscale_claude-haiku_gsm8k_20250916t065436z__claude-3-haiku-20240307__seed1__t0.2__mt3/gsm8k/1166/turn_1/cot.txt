Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. During the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
7. Now we can calculate the 8-year-old tree's production: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up the total fruits produced over the 10 years:
