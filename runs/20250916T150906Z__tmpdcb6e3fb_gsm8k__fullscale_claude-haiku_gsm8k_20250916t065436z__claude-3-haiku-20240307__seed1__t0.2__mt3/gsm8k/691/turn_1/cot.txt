Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each.
   * Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 x $20 = $40

2. The dog also needs a heartworm check, which is 60% of the total bill.
   * Let's call the total bill 'x'.
   * Heartworm check = 0.6x

3. The total bill is the sum of the vaccines and the heartworm check.
   * Total bill = $40 + 0.6x

4. John brought $125 with him.
   * We want to find how much he leaves with, which is the amount he brought minus the total bill.
   * Amount left = $125 - ($40 + 0.6x)

5. To find the value of 'x', we can set the amount left equal to 0 and solve for x.
   * $125 - ($40 + 0.6x) = 0
   * $125 - $40 - 0.6x
