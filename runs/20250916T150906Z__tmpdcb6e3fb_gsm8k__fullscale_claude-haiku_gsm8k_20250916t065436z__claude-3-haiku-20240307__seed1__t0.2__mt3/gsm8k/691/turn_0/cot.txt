Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each.
- The dog also needs a heartworm check.
- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
- John brought $125 with him.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 2 vaccines.
Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 Ã— $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
Let's call the total bill "x".
Heartworm check = 0.6x

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total bill.
Total bill = Cost of vaccines + Cost of heartworm check
x = $40 + 0.6x

Step 4: Solve the equation for the total bill.
x = $40 + 0.6x
0.4x = $40
x = $100

Step 5: Calculate the amount John leaves with.
John brought $125
