Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carla has 8 identical octuplets (8 babies)
- 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple
- 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue
- All the blue-wearing babies and 1/3 of the purple-wearing babies also wear bows

Step 1: Calculate the number of babies wearing purple and the number wearing blue.
Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies wearing bows.
All 2 blue-wearing babies wear bows.
1/3 of the 6 purple-wearing babies wear bows, which is 2 babies.
Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of bow-wearing babies that are wearing purple.
Total number of babies wearing bows = 4
