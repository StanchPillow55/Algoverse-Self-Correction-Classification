Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2) She dresses 3/4 of them in purple and 1/4 in blue.
   * 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies in purple
   * 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies in blue

3) All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows.
   * 2 blue-wearers wear bows
   * 1/3 of 6 purple-wearers = 2 purple-wearers wear bows

4) To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple:
   * Total babies wearing bows = 4
   * Babies wearing purple bows = 2
   * Percentage = (2 purple bows / 4 total bows) x 100 = 50%

Therefore, the
