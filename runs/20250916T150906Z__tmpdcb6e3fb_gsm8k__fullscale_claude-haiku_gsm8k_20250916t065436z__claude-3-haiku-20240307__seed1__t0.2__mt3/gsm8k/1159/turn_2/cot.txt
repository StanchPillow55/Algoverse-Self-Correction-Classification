Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carla has identical octuplets (8 babies)
- 3/4 of the babies are dressed in purple
- 1/4 of the babies are dressed in blue
- All the blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple wearers also wear bows

Step 1: Calculate the number of babies wearing purple and blue.
Number of babies wearing purple = 3/4 of 8 = 6 babies
Number of babies wearing blue = 1/4 of 8 = 2 babies

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies wearing bows.
All the blue-wearers wear bows = 2 babies
1/3 of the purple wearers wear bows = 1/3 of 6 = 2 babies
Total number of babies wearing bows = 2 + 2 = 4 babies

Step 3: Calculate the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
Total number of babies wearing bows = 4
Number of babies
