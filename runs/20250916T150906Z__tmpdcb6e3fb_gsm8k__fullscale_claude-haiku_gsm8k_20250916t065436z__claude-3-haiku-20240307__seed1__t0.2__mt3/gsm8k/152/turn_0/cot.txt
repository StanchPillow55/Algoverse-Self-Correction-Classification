Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
- Each pack of cookies has 6 cookies inside.
- Each cookie costs $0.10.
- Carl pays with a $10 bill.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Carl bought.
Total number of cookies = Number of packs × Number of cookies per pack
Total number of cookies = 10 × 6 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.
Total cost of cookies = Total number of cookies × Cost per cookie
Total cost of cookies = 60 × $0.10 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the change Carl receives.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost of cookies
Change = $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00

Therefore, the change Carl receives is $4.00.
