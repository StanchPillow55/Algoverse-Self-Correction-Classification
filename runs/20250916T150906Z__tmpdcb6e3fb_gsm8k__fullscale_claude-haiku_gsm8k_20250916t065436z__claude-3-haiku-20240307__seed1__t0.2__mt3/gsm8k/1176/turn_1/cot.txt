Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- The teacher normally uses 20% of the chalk each day.
- The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
- On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday.
Since the teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday, we can calculate the amount of chalk used:
Amount of chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 Ã— 5 inches = 2.25 inches

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday.
Amount of chalk remaining = Total chalk - Amount of chalk used on Monday
Amount of chalk remaining = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk at the normal 20% usage rate.
Amount of chalk remaining / Chalk used per day = Number of days
2.75 inches / (0.
