To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Given information:
- The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.
- The teacher normally uses 20% of the chalk each day.
- The teacher recycles the chalk when it is smaller than 2 inches.
- On Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday.
Amount of chalk used on Monday = 45% of 5 inches = 0.45 × 5 inches = 2.25 inches

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chalk remaining after Monday.
Amount of chalk remaining after Monday = 5 inches - 2.25 inches = 2.75 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of days the teacher can use the remaining chalk at the normal rate of 20% per day.
Amount of chalk used per day at 20% = 0.20 × 5 inches = 1 inch
Number of days = Remaining chalk / Chalk used per day
Number of days = 2.75 inches / 1 inch
