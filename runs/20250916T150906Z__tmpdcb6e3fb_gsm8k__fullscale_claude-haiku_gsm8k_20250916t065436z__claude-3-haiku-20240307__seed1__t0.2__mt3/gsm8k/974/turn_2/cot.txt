Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dictionary costs $18
- Dinosaur book costs $13
- Children's cookbook costs $8
- Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance
- Tyler earns $5 per hour

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy.
Total cost of books = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Step 2: Calculate how much more money Tyler needs to afford the books.
Amount needed = Total cost of books - Amount saved
Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Step 3: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining $25.
Hours needed = Amount needed / Hourly rate
Hours needed = $25 / $5 per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books he wants to buy.

Final answer: Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.
