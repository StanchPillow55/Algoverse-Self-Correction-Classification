1. Determine the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy:
   * Dictionary: $18
   * Dinosaur book: $13
   * Children's cookbook: $8
   * Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

2. Determine how much money Tyler has saved:
   * Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance.

3. Determine how much more money Tyler needs to buy the books:
   * Total cost of books: $39
   * Money saved: $14
   * Additional money needed: $39 - $14 = $25

4. Determine how much Tyler earns per hour:
   * Tyler earns $5 per hour.

5. Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn the additional $25:
   * Additional money needed: $25
   * Hourly rate: $5 per hour
   * Hours needed to work: $25 / $5 = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books he wants to
