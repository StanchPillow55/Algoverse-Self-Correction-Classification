Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The dictionary costs $18
- The dinosaur book costs $13
- The children's cookbook costs $8
- Tyler has saved $14 from his allowance
- Tyler earns $5 per hour

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books.
Total cost of books = Cost of dictionary + Cost of dinosaur book + Cost of children's cookbook
Total cost of books = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Tyler still needs to buy the books.
Amount of money needed = Total cost of books - Amount saved
Amount of money needed = $39 - $14 = $25

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours Tyler needs to work to earn the remaining $25.
Number of hours needed = Amount of money needed / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $25 / $5 per hour = 5 hours

Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.

Final answer: Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford the books.
