Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's represent Brooke's current age as x.

Step 1: Express Seth's current age in terms of Brooke's age.
Seth's current age = 2x

Step 2: Express the sum of their ages in 2 years.
Sum of their ages in 2 years = (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4

Step 3: Set up the equation based on the given information.
Sum of their ages in 2 years = 28
3x + 4 = 28

Step 4: Solve the equation for x.
3x + 4 = 28
3x = 24
x = 8

Step 5: Find Seth's current age.
Seth's current age = 2x = 2 Ã— 8 = 16

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.
