Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's represent Brooke's current age as x.

Step 1: Express Seth's current age in terms of Brooke's age.
Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age = 2x.

Step 2: Express the sum of their ages in 2 years.
Brooke's age in 2 years = x + 2
Seth's age in 2 years = 2x + 2
Sum of their ages in 2 years = (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for Brooke's current age.
We know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.
3x + 4 = 28
3x = 24
x = 8

Step 4: Calculate Seth's current age.
Seth's current
