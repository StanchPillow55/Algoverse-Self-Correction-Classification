Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Candice started with 80 post-it notes in her purse.
- She purchased a package of post-it notes at the store.
- At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

Step 1: Calculate the number of post-it notes used at work.
Number of post-it notes used at work = 220

Step 2: Calculate the total number of post-it notes Candice had before using them at work.
Total post-it notes before work = 80 (in her purse) + Unknown number from the package purchased

Step 3: Calculate the number of post-it notes used from the original 80 in her purse.
Post-it notes used from the original 80 = 80 - 23 (remaining) = 57

Step 4: Calculate the number of post-it notes from the package purchased.
Post-it notes from the package purchased = Total post-it notes before work -
