Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John spent 6 hours boating.
- He spent half the time boating on swimming.
- He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
- The time spent watching shows was 30% of the total time.
- He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent swimming.
Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on boating and swimming.
Total time spent on boating and swimming = 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time spent watching shows.
Time spent watching shows = 3 × 2 hours = 6 hours
This time spent watching shows is 30% of the total time.
Let's call the total time "x".
6 hours = 0.3x
x = 6 / 0.3 = 20 hours
