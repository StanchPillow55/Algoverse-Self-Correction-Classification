Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John spent 6 hours boating.
- He spent half the time boating on swimming.
- He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
- The time spent watching shows was 30% of his total time.
- He spent 40% of his time sightseeing.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent swimming.
Time spent boating = 6 hours
Time spent swimming = 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on boating and swimming.
Total time spent on boating and swimming = 6 hours + 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent watching shows.
Time spent watching each show = 2 hours
Total time spent watching shows = 3 × 2 hours = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent.
Total time spent = Time spent on boating and swimming + Time spent watching shows
Total time spent = 9 hours + 6 hours =
