Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Time spent boating:
   * John spent 6 hours boating.

2. Time spent swimming:
   * He spent half the time boating, which is 6 hours / 2 = 3 hours.

3. Time spent watching shows:
   * He watched 3 different shows, each 2 hours long.
   * Total time watching shows = 3 shows x 2 hours = 6 hours.
   * This was 30% of the total time.

4. Calculating the total time:
   * Let's call the total time "x".

   * So, 15 hours = 0.3x
   * Solving for x, we get x = 15 / 0.3 = 50 hours.

5. Time spent sightseeing:
   * We know that sightseeing
