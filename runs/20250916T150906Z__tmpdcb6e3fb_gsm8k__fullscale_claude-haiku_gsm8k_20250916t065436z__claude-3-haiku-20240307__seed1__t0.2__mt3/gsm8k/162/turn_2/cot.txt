Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The initial cost of a bag of marbles is $20.
- The price increases by 20% of the original price every two months.
- We need to find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months.

Step 1: Calculate the price increase every two months.
Price increase = 20% of the original price
Price increase = 0.20 Ã— $20 = $4

Step 2: Calculate the new price after every two-month period.
Initial price = $20
After 2 months: $20 + $4 = $24
After 4 months: $24 + $4 = $28
After 6 months: $28 + $4 = $32
After 8 months: $32 + $4 = $36
After 10 months: $36 + $4 = $40
After 12 months: $40 + $4 = $44
After 14 months: $44 + $4 = $48
After 16
