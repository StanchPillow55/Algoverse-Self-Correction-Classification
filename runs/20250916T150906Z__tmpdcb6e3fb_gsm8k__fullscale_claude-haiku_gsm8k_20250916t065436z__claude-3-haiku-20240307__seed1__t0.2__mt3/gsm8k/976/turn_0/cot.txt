To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold over the two days, and then calculate the total earnings.

Given information:
- On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie.
- The gingerbread cost $6 per box, and the apple pie cost $15 per box.

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold on each day.
Saturday:
- Gingerbread: 10 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 - 4 = 11 boxes

Sunday:
- Gingerbread: 10 + 5 = 15 boxes
- Apple pie: 15 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of boxes of gingerbread and apple pie sold over the two days.
Total gingerbread boxes sold = 10 + 15 = 25
