Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- We need to find the cost of 8 pens.

Step 1: Find the cost of a pen.
Cost of a pen = Cost of a pencil + Cost of an eraser
Cost of a pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Step 2: Find the cost of 8 pens.
Cost of 8 pens = 8 × Cost of a pen
Cost of 8 pens = 8 × $1.50 = $12.00

Therefore, the cost of 8 pens is $12.00.
