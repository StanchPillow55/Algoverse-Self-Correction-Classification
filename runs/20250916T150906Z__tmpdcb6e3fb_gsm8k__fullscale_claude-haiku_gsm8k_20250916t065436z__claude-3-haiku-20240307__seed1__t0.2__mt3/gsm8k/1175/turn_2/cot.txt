Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. In the first half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 4 goals
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 2 goals

2. In the second half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 ร 2 = 8 goals

To find the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half:
   - Team B scored 8 goals in the second half
   - Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 รท 4 = 2 goals

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
   - In the first half:
     - Team A scored 4 goals
     - Team B scored 2 goals
   - In the second half:
     - Team A scored 2 goals
     -
