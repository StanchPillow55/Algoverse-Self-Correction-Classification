Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- In the first half of the soccer match, team A scores 4 goals.
- In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A.
- In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.
Team A's goals in the
