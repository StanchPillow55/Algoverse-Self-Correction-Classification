Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. In the first half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 4 goals
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so 4 - 2 = 2 goals

2. In the second half of the soccer match:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 × 2 = 8 goals
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B, which is 1/4 × 8 = 2 goals

3. To calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
   - First half:
     - Team A: 4 goals
     - Team B: 2 goals
   - Second half:
     - Team A: 2 goals
     - Team B: 8 goals
   - Total goals scored in the match:
     - Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
     - Team B: 2 + 8 =
