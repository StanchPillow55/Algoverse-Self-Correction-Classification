To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays and the number of glasses of water he drinks during the weekends, then add them together to find the total number of glasses of water he drinks in a week.

Given information:
- John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on weekdays.
- John drinks a glass of water before going to bed on weekdays.
- John drinks a soda with dinner on weekends instead of water.

Step 1: Calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays.
Number of glasses of water per weekday = 3 (breakfast, lunch, dinner) + 1 (before bed) = 4 glasses
Number of weekdays in a week = 5 (Monday to Friday)
Total number of glasses of water during the weekdays = 4 glasses Ã— 5 days = 20 glasses

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekends.
Number of glasses of water per weekend day = 0 (John drinks soda with dinner instead)
Number of weekend days in a week = 2
