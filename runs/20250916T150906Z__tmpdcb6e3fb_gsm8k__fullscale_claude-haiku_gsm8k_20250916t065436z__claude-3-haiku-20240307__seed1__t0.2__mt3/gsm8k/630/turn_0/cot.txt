Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
- Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
- There are 100 riders in total.

Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.
25% of 100 riders = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders can stay upright

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who can stay upright on the wave.
60% of 25 riders = 0.60 × 25 = 15 women can stay upright

Step 3: Calculate the number of men who can stay upright on the wave.
Total riders who can stay upright = 25
Number of women who can stay upright = 15
Number of men who can stay upright = Total riders who can stay upright - Number of women who can stay upright
Number of men who can stay upright = 25 - 15 = 10 men

Therefore,
