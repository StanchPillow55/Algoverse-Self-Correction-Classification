Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip:
   * Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
   * Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
   * Total distance from first city to third city: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
   * Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles
   * Total distance for one trip: 175 + 125 = 300 miles

2. Calculate the total distance the train travels in one day:
   * The train does this trip 3 times a day
   * Total distance per day: 3 x 300 miles = 900 miles

3. Calculate the number of days between services:
   * The train needs service every 18,000 miles
   * Number of days between services: 18,000 miles / 900 miles per day = 20 days

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.
