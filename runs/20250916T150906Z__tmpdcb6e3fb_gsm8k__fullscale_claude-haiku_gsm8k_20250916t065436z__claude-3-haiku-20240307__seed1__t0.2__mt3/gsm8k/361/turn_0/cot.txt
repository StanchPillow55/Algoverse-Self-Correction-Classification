Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The train travels between 3 different cities.
- The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles.
- The distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles.
- The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs.
- The train does this trip 3 times a day.
- The train needs service every 18,000 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip.
Distance from first city to second city: 75 miles
Distance from second city to third city: 100 miles
Total distance of the first two legs: 75 + 100 = 175 miles
Distance from third city to first city: 175 - 50 = 125 miles
Total distance of the trip: 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled by the train in a day.
The train does this trip 3 times a day
