To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought for her Art class.

Given information:
- Beatrice bought 10 packets of crayons.
- 6 packets had 8 pieces of colors each.
- 4 packets had 16 pieces of colors each.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons in the 6 packets with 8 pieces each.
Number of crayons in 6 packets with 8 pieces each = 6 × 8 = 48 crayons

Step 2: Calculate the total number of crayons in the 4 packets with 16 pieces each.
Number of crayons in 4 packets with 16 pieces each = 4 × 16 = 64 crayons

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crayons Beatrice bought.
Total number of crayons = Number of crayons in 6 packets with 8 pieces each + Number of crayons in 4 packets with 16 pieces each
Total number of crayons
