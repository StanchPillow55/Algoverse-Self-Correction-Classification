Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha is knitting for 3 grandchildren (triplets)
- She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them

To calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to find the number of skeins required for each item and then multiply it by the number of grandchildren.

1. Hat:
   - 2 skeins of wool per hat
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for hats = 2 x 3 = 6 skeins

2. Scarf:
   - 4 skeins of wool per scarf
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for scarves = 4 x 3 = 12 skeins

3. Sweater:
   - 12 skeins of wool per sweater
   - 3 grandchildren
   - Total skeins for sweaters = 12 x 3 = 36 ske
