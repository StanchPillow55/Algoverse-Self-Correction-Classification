- Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren, who are triplets.
- She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them.
- It takes:
  - 2 skeins of wool to make a hat
  - 4 skeins of wool to make a scarf
  - 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater
  - 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens
  - 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks

To calculate the total number of skeins of wool needed, we need to multiply the number of items by the number of skeins required for each item, and then add them all up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of skeins needed for each item.
- Hats: 3 grandchildren x 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
- Scarves: 3 grandchildren x 4 skeins per
