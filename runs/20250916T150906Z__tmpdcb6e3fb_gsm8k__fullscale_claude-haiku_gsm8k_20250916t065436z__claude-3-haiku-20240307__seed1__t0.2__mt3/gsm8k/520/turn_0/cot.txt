To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for all the items Martha wants to make for her three grandchildren.

Given information:
- Martha wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat.
- It takes 4 skeins of wool to make a scarf.
- It takes 12 skeins of wool to make a sweater.
- It takes 1 skein of wool to make a pair of mittens.
- It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a pair of socks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of skeins of wool required for each item.
Hats: 3 grandchildren × 2 skeins per hat = 6 skeins
Scarves: 3 grandchildren × 4 skeins per scarf = 12 skeins
Sweaters: 3 grandchildren × 12 skeins per sweater = 36
