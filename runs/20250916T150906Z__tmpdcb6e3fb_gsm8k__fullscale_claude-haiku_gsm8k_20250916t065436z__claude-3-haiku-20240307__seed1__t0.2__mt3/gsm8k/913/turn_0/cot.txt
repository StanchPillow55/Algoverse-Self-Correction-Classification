Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of yellow balloons

We know that the total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58, so we can set up an equation:
2(20) + 3x = 58

Explanation:
- 2(20) represents the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the 20 red balloons (2 pieces per red balloon)
- 3x represents the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the x yellow balloons (3 pieces per yellow balloon)
- The sum of these two terms equals the total of 58 pieces of bologna thrown

Now, let's solve the equation for x:
2(20) + 3x
