Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

To find the number of yellow balloons, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons
2. Subtract the total pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total 58 pieces
3. Divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon to get the number of yellow balloons

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons
Total pieces thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per red balloon Ã— 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Subtract the total pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total 58 pieces
Remaining pieces = 58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Step 3: Divide the remaining pieces by the number of pieces
