Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons.
Number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per red balloon Ã— 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons.
Total pieces of bologna thrown = 58 pieces
Pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 40 pieces
Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = Total pieces - Pieces at red balloons
Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons = 58 - 40 = 18 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of yellow balloons.
Pieces of bologna per yellow balloon = 3 pieces
Number of yellow balloons = Pieces of bologna thrown at yellow ball
