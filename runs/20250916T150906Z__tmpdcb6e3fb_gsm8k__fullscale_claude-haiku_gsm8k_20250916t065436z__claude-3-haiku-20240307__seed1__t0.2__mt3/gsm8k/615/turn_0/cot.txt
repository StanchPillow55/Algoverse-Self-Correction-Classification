To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items Scarlett purchased.

Given information:
- Scarlett found an aquarium for $10.00 at a yard sale.
- She bought 2 bags of rocks for $2.50 each.
- She bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.00 apiece.
- She bought 20 fish at $0.50 each.
- She bought fish food that cost $2.00.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the rocks.
Cost of 2 bags of rocks = 2 × $2.50 = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the coral.
Cost of 3 pieces of coral = 3 × $2.00 = $6.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fish.
Cost of 20 fish = 20 × $0.50 = $10.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
Total cost =
