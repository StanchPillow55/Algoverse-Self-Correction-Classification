Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Aquarium cost: $10.00
2. Rocks:
   - 2 bags at $2.50 each
   - Total cost for rocks: 2 x $2.50 = $5.00
3. Coral:
   - 3 pieces at $2.00 each
   - Total cost for coral: 3 x $2.00 = $6.00
4. Fish:
   - 20 fish at $0.50 each
   - Total cost for fish: 20 x $0.50 = $10.00
5. Fish food: $2.00

Now, let's add up all the costs:
Aquarium: $10.00
Rocks: $5.00
Coral: $6.00
Fish: $10.00
Fish food: $2.00

Total amount spent: $10.00 + $5.00 + $6.00 + $10.00 + $2.00 = $33.00

Therefore, the total
