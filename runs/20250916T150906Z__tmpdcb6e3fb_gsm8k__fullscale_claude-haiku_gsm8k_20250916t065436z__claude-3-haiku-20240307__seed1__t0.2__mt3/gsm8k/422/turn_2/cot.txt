Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill gets the introductory deal for the first 6 months at $8 per month.
   * 6 months x $8 per month = $48 for the introductory period.

2. After the introductory period, the normal price is $12 per month.
   * For the next 8 months, Bill pays $12 per month.
   * 8 months x $12 per month = $96 for the normal price period.

3. After 14 months (6 months introductory + 8 months normal), the price increases to $14 per month.
   * For the remaining 10 months (2 years - 14 months), Bill pays $14 per month.
   * 10 months x $14 per month = $140 for the increased price period.

4. To calculate the total cost for 2 years:
   * Introductory period: $48
   * Normal price period: $96
   * Increased price period: $140
   * Total cost
