Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first 6 months were $8 per month.
- After the first 6 months, the normal price was $12 per month.
- After 8 months at the normal price, the price increased to $14 per month.
- We need to find the total cost for 2 years (24 months) of the service.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for the first 6 months.
Cost for the first 6 months = 6 × $8 = $48

Step 2: Calculate the cost for the next 8 months at the normal price.
Cost for the next 8 months = 8 × $12 = $96

Step 3: Calculate the cost for the remaining 10 months at the increased price.
Cost for the remaining 10 months = 10 × $14 = $140

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 2 years (24 months) of the service.
Total cost = Cost for the first 6 months + Cost for the next 8
