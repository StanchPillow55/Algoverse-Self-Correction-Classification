Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill gets a special introductory deal for the first 6 months where the service costs $8 per month.
   * For the first 6 months, the total cost is:
     * 6 months x $8 per month = $48

2. After the introductory deal, the normal price is $12 per month.
   * For the next 8 months at the normal price, the total cost is:
     * 8 months x $12 per month = $96

3. After 14 months (6 months introductory + 8 months normal), the service increases the price to $14 per month.
   * For the remaining 10 months at the new price, the total cost is:
     * 10 months x $14 per month = $140

4. To calculate the total cost for 2 years (24 months):
   * Total cost = $48 (introductory) + $96 (normal) + $140 (new price)
   * Total cost = $48
