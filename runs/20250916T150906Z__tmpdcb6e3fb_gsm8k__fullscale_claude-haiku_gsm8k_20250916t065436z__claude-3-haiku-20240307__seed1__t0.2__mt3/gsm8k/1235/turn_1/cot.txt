Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr
- He travels for 3 days
- The distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Michael can cover in 3 days.
Distance covered per day = Average speed × Hours per day
Distance covered per day = 50 km/hr × 24 hrs/day = 1200 km/day
Total distance covered in 3 days = Distance covered per day × Number of days
Total distance covered in 3 days = 1200 km/day × 3 days = 3600 km

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered.
Percentage of distance covered = (Total distance covered / Total distance between Alaska and Texas) × 100
Percentage of distance covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
