Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jack had $100 initially.
- Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100.

Step 1: Calculate how much money Sophia gave to Jack.
Sophia's money = $100
1/5 of Sophia's money = $100 Ã— 1/5 = $20
Sophia gave Jack $20.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jack has now.
Jack's initial money = $100
Money received from Sophia = $20
Total money Jack has now = $100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, the final answer is that Jack now has $120.
