Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.
- 5 cars from the line took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to work backwards from the final number of cars.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cars that remained after the 20 cars drove through in the last 15 minutes.
Original number of cars - Cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes - Cars that took the exit = Number of cars remaining
30 - 20 - 5 = 5 cars remaining

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
Original number of cars - Cars that remained - Cars that drove through in the last 15 minutes - Cars that took the exit = Cars that drove through in the first 15
