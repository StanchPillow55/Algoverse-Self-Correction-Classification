Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.
- He sells his old bedroom set for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the new bedroom set.
- He has to pay 10% per month for the remaining balance of the bedroom set.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining balance that Tom has to pay for the bedroom set.
Total cost of the bedroom set = $3000
Amount paid from the sale of the old bedroom set = $1000
Remaining balance = $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment for the remaining balance.
Monthly payment = 10% of the remaining balance
Monthly payment = 0.10 Ã— $2000 = $200

Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.
