To solve this problem, we need to find the remaining amount Tom has to pay for the bedroom set after using the $1000 from the sale of his old bedroom set, and then calculate the monthly payment based on the 10% interest rate.

Given information:
- Tom buys a bedroom set for $3000.
- He sells his old bedroom set for $1000 and uses that to pay for part of the bedroom set.
- He has to pay 10% per month for the bedroom set.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining amount Tom has to pay for the bedroom set.
Remaining amount = Cost of the bedroom set - Amount paid from the sale of the old bedroom set
Remaining amount = $3000 - $1000 = $2000

Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment based on the 10% interest rate.
Monthly payment = Remaining amount × (Interest rate / 12)
Monthly payment = $2000 × (0.10 / 12)
Monthly payment = $2000 × 0.00833
Monthly payment = $16.67

Therefore, Tom has to pay $16.67 per month for the bedroom
