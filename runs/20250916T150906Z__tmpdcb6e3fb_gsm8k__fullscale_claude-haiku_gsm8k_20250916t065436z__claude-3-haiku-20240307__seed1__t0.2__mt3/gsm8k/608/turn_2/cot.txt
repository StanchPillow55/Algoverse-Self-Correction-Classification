Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Joe has $50 to spend on an outfit for his field trip.
- There is a 30% off sale at the clothing store.
- The shirt he picks out costs $25.
- The pair of shorts he picks out costs $35.
- Sales tax is included in the prices.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the shirt.
Original price of the shirt = $25
Discount percentage = 30%
Discounted price of the shirt = $25 - (30% of $25) = $25 - $7.50 = $17.50

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the outfit.
Cost of the shirt = $17.50
Cost of the shorts = $35
Total cost of the outfit = $17.50 + $35 = $52.50

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Joe has left after the purchase.
Joe's initial budget = $50
Total cost of the outfit = $52.50
Amount of money Joe has left = $50 - $52.50
