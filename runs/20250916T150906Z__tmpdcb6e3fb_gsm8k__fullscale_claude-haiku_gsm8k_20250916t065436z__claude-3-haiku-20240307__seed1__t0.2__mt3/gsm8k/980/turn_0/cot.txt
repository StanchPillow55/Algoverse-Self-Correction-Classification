Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beads Adrianne's sister gave her.
Beads from sister = Beads from mother + 10
Beads from sister = 20 + 10 = 30 beads

Step 2: Calculate the number of beads Adrianne's friend gave her.
Beads from friend = 2 × Beads from mother
Beads from friend = 2 × 20 = 40 beads

Step 3: Calculate the total number of beads Adrianne had altogether.
Total beads = Beads from mother + Beads from sister + Beads from friend
Total beads = 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads

Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.

Final
