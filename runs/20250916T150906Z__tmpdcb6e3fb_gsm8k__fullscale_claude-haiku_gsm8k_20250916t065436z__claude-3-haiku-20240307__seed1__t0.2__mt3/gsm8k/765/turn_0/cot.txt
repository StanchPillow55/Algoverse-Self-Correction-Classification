Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- George has 45% more pears than bananas.
- George has 200 bananas.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pears George has.
Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can use the following formula:
Number of pears = Number of bananas + 45% of number of bananas
Number of pears = 200 + (0.45 Ã— 200)
Number of pears = 200 + 90
Number of pears = 290

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruits George has.
Total number of fruits = Number of bananas + Number of pears
Total number of fruits = 200 + 290
Total number of fruits = 490

Therefore, George has a total of 490 fruits.

Final answer: George has a total of 490 fruits.
