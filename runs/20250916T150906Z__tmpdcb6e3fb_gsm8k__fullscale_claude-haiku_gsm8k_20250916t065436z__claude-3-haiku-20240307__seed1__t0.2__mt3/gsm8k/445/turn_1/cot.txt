Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- For every mile the horse runs, it eats 1/2 a bail of hay.
- A bail of hay costs $3.
- The horse runs for 30 minutes at 32 MPH.
- Michael has six $5 bills.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 32 MPH × (30 minutes / 60 minutes per hour)
Distance = 16 miles

Step 2: Calculate the amount of hay the horse eats.
Hay consumed = Distance × 1/2 bails per mile
Hay consumed = 16 miles × 1/2 bails per mile
Hay consumed = 8 bails of hay

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the hay.
Cost of hay = Hay consumed × $3 per bail
Cost of hay = 8 bails × $3 per bail
Cost of hay = $24

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Michael has.
