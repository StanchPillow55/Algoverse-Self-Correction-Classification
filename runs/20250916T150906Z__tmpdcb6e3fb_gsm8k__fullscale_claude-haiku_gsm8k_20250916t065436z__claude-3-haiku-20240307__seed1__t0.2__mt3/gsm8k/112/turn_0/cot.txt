To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

Given information:
- The classroom has 4 teachers.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- The whiteboard is used in each lesson.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 1: Find the total number of lessons in a day.
Total number of lessons per day = Number of teachers × Number of lessons per teacher
Total number of lessons per day = 4 × 2 = 8 lessons

Step 2: Find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.
Total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day = Total number of lessons × Number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson
Total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned per day = 8 lessons × 3 times per lesson = 24 times

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

Final answer: The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.
