Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   * This means she needs 0.5 yards of material per small mask (2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask).

2. Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   * This means she needs 0.75 yards of material per large mask (2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask).

3. We need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small and 8 large masks.
   * For the 20 small masks, we need 20 * 0.5 = 10 yards of material.
   * For the 8 large masks, we need 8 * 0.75 = 6 yards of material.
   * The total material required is 10 + 6 = 16 yards.

Therefore, the amount of material Jo would need to make 20 small and 8
