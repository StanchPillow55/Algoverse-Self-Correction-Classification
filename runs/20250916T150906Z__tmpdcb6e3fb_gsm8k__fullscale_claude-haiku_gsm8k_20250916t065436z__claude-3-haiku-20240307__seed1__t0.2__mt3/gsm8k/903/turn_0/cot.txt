To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Given information:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks.
Number of small masks needed = 20
Amount of material needed for 4 small masks = 2 yards
Amount of material needed for 20 small masks = (20 ÷ 4) × 2 = 10 yards

Step 2: Calculate the amount of material needed for the large masks.
Number of large masks needed = 8
Amount of material needed for 3 large masks = 2.25 yards
Amount of material needed for 8 large masks = (8 ÷ 3) × 2.25 = 6 yards

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of material needed.
Total amount of material neede
