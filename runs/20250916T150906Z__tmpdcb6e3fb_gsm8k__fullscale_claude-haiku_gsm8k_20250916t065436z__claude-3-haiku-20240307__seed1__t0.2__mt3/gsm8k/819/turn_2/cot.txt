Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 20 students working together to raise money for a charity.
- The total amount raised is $175,000.
- $50,000 comes from organizations, and the rest comes from the students.

To find how much each student raised, we need to:
1. Calculate the amount raised by the students.
2. Divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised by the students.
Total amount raised - Amount from organizations = Amount raised by students
$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Step 2: Divide the amount raised by the students by the number of students.
Amount raised by students / Number of students = Amount raised by each student
$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.
