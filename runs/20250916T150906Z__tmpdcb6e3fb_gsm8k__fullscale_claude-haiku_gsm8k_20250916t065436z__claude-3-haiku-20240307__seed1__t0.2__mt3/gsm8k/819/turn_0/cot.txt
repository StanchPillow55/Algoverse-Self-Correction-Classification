To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money raised by the students and then divide it by the number of students to determine the amount raised by each student.

Given information:
- The charity raised a total of $175,000.
- $50,000 came from organizations.
- There are 20 students working together.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money raised by the students.
Total amount raised - Amount from organizations = Amount raised by students
$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount raised by each student.
Amount raised by students / Number of students = Amount raised by each student
$125,000 / 20 = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.

Final answer: Each student raised $6,250.
