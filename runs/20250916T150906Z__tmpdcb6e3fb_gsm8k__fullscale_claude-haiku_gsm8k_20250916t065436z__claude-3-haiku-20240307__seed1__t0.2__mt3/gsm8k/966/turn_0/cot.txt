To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of brownies Greta had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten during the day.

Given information:
- Greta made a batch of one dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies.
- At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.
- At her surprise party, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had.
Total brownies = Brownies made + Brownies from office party + Brownies from surprise party
Total brownies = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Step 2: Calculate the number of brownies eaten during the day.
Brownies eaten = 1 1/2 dozen = 18 brownies

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies left over.
Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
