Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Greta made a batch of 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.

2. At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.

3. At the surprise party at home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.

4. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Now, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day:
* Brownies made for herself: 12
* Brownies from office party: 6
* Brownies at home party: 48

Total brownies: 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies

Now, let's calculate how many brownies were eaten:
* Brownies eaten at party: 18

Finally, we can calculate the number of brownies Greta had left over:
* Brownies left over = Total brownies - Brownies eaten
* Brownies left over = 66
