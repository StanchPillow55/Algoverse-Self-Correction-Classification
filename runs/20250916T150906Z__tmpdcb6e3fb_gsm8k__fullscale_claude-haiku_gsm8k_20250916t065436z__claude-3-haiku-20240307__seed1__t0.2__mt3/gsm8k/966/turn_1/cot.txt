Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greta made a batch of 1 dozen (12) cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.
- At her office party, she was sent home with 1/2 a dozen (6) brownies.
- At her surprise party at home, there were 4 dozen (48) brownies waiting.
- During the party, 1 1/2 dozen (18) brownies were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of brownies Greta had throughout the day.
Brownies from her own batch + Brownies from office party + Brownies from home party
= 12 + 6 + 48
= 66 brownies

Step 2: Calculate the number of brownies eaten during the day.
Brownies eaten during the party = 18

Step 3: Calculate the number of brownies Greta had left over.
Total brownies - Brownies eaten
= 66 - 18
= 48 brownies

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left
