Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle.
- The cat can run 15 feet/second.

To find how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to first find the turtle's speed.

Step 1: Find the turtle's speed.
Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to get the turtle's speed.
Turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
Turtle's speed = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
