Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.
- On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday.
- On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday.
- 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Friday.
Amount of crawfish caught on Friday = 4 ร 3 pounds = 12 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of crawfish Joe caught on Saturday.
Amount of crawfish caught on Saturday = 12 pounds รท 2 = 6 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days.
Total amount of crawfish caught = Amount on Thursday + Amount on Friday + Amount on Saturday
Total amount of crawfish caught = 3 pounds + 12 pounds + 6 pounds = 21 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the number of servings of crawfish Joe has.
Number of servings = Total amount of crawfish caught รท
