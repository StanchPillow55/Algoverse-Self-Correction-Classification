Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish.

2. On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday:
   * 4 x 3 pounds = 12 pounds

3. On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday:
   * 12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds

4. To find the total amount of crawfish Joe caught:
   * Thursday: 3 pounds
   * Friday: 12 pounds
   * Saturday: 6 pounds
   * Total: 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

5. We know that 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds.
   * To find the number of servings, we divide the total pounds by 3:
   * 21 pounds / 3 pounds per serving = 7 servings

Therefore, the final answer is that Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.
