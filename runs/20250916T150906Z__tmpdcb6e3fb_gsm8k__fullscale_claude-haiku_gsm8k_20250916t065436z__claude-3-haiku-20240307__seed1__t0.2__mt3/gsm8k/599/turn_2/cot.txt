Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pet store has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds.

To find the total number of legs, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of legs for the dogs.
Dogs have 4 legs each.
Number of legs for dogs = 5 dogs × 4 legs per dog = 20 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of legs for the cats.
Cats also have 4 legs each.
Number of legs for cats = 2 cats × 4 legs per cat = 8 legs

Step 3: Calculate the number of legs for the birds.
Birds have 2 legs each.
Number of legs for birds = 10 birds × 2 legs per bird = 20 legs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of legs.
Total number of legs = Number of legs for dogs + Number of legs for cats + Number of legs for birds
Total number of legs = 20 + 8 +
