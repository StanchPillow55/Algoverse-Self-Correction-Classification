Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Let's define the variables:
- Let Peter's age be x.
- Let Paul's age be x + 10, since he is 10 years older than Jean.
- Let Jean's age be x - 10, since Paul is 10 years older than her.

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean.
Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age = 100
x + (x + 10) + (x - 10) = 100

Step 2: Simplify the equation and solve for x.
3x = 100
x = 100 / 3
x = 33.33 years

Step 3: Find Peter's age.
Peter's age = x = 33.33 years

Step 4: Find Paul's age.
Paul's
