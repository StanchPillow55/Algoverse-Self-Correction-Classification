Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let's say:
- Peter's age = x
- Paul's age = y
- Jean's age = z

Step 2: We know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can express Paul's age in terms of Jean's age.
Paul's age (y) = Jean's age (z) + 10

Step 3: We also know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.
Peter's age (x) = Paul's age (y) + Jean's age (z)
x = y + z

Step 4: We can substitute the expression for Paul's age (y) into the equation for Peter's age (x).
x = (z + 10) + z
x = 2z + 10
