Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.

Step 1: Let's represent the ages of the three people as variables.
Let Jean's age be x.
Then, Paul's age is x + 10, and Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10.

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the combined age of the three people.
Combined age = Peter's age + Paul's age + Jean's age
100 = (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x
100 = 4x + 20

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
4x + 20 = 100
4x = 80
x = 20

Step 4: Find the ages of the three people.
Jean's age = x = 20 years
Paul's age = x + 10 = 20
