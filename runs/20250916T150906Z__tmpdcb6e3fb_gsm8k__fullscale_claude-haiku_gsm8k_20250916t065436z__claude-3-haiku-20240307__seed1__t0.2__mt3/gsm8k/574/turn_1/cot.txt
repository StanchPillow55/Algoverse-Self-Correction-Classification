Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.
- They spend $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.
- They sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of bread per sandwich.
Cost of bread per loaf = $3.00
Number of sandwiches per loaf = 10
Cost of bread per sandwich = $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

Step 2: Calculate the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich.
Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches = $30.00
Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich = $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost per sandwich.
Total cost per sandwich = Cost of bread per sandwich + Cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich
Total cost per sandwich = $0.30 + $3.00
