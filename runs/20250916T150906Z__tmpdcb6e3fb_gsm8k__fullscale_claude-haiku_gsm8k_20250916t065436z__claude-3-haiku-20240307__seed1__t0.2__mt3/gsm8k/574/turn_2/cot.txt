Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cost of Bread:
   * The food truck sources bread for $3.00 per loaf
   * Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches
   * So the cost of bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30

2. Cost of Cheese and Condiments:
   * The food truck spends $30.00 on cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches
   * So the cost of cheese and condiments per sandwich is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00

3. Total Cost per Sandwich:
   * Cost of Bread: $0.30
   * Cost of Cheese and Condiments: $3.00
   * Total Cost per Sandwich: $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30

4. Revenue per Sandwich:
   * The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each
   * Revenue per Sandwich: $7.00

5. Net Profit per Sandwich:
