Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
- The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
- Every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months the research took.
Initial research period: 5 months
Total research period: 10 times longer = 5 months x 10 = 50 months

Step 2: Calculate the funding for the first 5 months.
Funding for the first 5 months = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months).
Funding for each month after the first 5 months = $100,000 + (50% of $100,000) = $150,000
Total funding for the remaining 45 months = $150,000 x 45 = $6,750,000

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the
