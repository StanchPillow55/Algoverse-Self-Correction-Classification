Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John gets initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.
- The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months.
- Every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of months the research took.
Initial research period: 5 months
Total research period: 5 months x 10 = 50 months

Step 2: Calculate the funding for the first 5 months.
Funding for the first 5 months = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate the funding for the remaining 45 months (50 months - 5 months).
Funding for the first 5 months after the initial period = $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
Funding for the next 5 months = $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
Funding for the final 35 months = $225,000 x 1.
