Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- To make 1 jar of the mixture, it takes:
  - 2 pounds of passion fruit
  - 1.5 pounds of jackfruit
  - 2 pounds of special honey
- The costs of the ingredients are:
  - Passion fruit: $6 per pound
  - Jackfruit: $8 per pound
  - Honey: $10 per pound
- Tim sells each jar for $50
- Tim wants to sell 10 jars

Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for 1 jar.
Cost of passion fruit = 2 pounds × $6 per pound = $12
Cost of jackfruit = 1.5 pounds × $8 per pound = $12
Cost of honey = 2 pounds × $10 per pound = $20
Total cost of ingredients for 1 jar = $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling 1 jar.
Revenue from selling 1 jar = $
