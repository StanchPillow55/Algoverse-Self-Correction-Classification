Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops.
   * Let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops 'x' kilograms.
   * The T-Rex ate half of 'x', which is x/2 kilograms.

2) The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
   * After the T-Rex ate, there was x/2 kilograms left.
   * The velociraptors ate half of that, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms.

3) The Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   * The amount of meat left after the velociraptors was x/2 - x/4 = x/4 kilograms.
   * Since the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we can say that x/4 = 270.

4) Solving for the original amount 'x':
   * x/4
