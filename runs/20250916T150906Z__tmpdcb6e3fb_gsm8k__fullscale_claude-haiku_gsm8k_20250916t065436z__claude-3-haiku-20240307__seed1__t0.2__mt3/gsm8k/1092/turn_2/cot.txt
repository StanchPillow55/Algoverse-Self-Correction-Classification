Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops it had hunted.
   * This means the T-Rex ate 50% of the total meat on the triceratops.

2) After the T-Rex left, a pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
   * This means the velociraptors ate 50% of the remaining 50% of the meat.
   * So the velociraptors ate 25% of the total meat.

3) A group of lazy Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.
   * This tells us that the remaining 25% of the meat was 270 kilograms.

Now let's work backwards to find the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate:

* The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg, which was 25% of the total.
* To find the total, we divide 270 kg by 0.25 (25% expressed as a decimal):
