To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the given information to find the original weight of the triceratops.

Given information:
- The Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the small triceratops.
- The pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
- The group of Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.

Let's represent the original weight of the triceratops as "x" kilograms.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the triceratops after the Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of it.
Weight of the triceratops after the T-Rex ate = x/2 kilograms

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the triceratops after the pack of velociraptors scavenged half of what was left.
Weight of the triceratops after the velociraptors scavenged = (x/2)/2 = x/4 kilograms

Step 3: The group of Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kilograms of meat.
Weight of
