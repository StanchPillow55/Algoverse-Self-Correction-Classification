Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes him 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel each potato.
- It takes him 5 seconds to cut up each potato.

To find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and the time for cutting, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the time for peeling the potatoes.
Time to peel 1 potato = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
Time to peel all 60 potatoes = 60 × 90 seconds = 5,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the time for cutting the potatoes.
Time to cut 1 potato = 5 seconds
Time to cut all 60 potatoes = 60 × 5 seconds = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time by adding the time for peeling and cutting.
Total time = Time for peeling + Time for cutting
Total time
