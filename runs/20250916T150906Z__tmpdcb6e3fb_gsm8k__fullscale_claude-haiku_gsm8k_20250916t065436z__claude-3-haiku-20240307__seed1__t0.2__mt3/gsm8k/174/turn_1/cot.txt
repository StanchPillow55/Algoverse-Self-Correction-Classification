Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes him 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel each potato.
- It takes him 5 seconds to cut up each potato.

To find the total time it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the time for peeling and the time for cutting, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the time for peeling all 60 potatoes.
Time to peel 1 potato = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds
Time to peel all 60 potatoes = 60 × 90 seconds = 5,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the time for cutting up all 60 potatoes.
Time to cut 1 potato = 5 seconds
Time to cut all 60 potatoes = 60 × 5 seconds = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time by adding the time for peeling and the time for cutting.
Total time =
