To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all 60 potatoes.

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel a potato.
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut up a potato.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes.
Time to peel one potato × Number of potatoes = Total time to peel all potatoes
90 seconds × 60 potatoes = 5,400 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to cut up all 60 potatoes.
Time to cut up one potato × Number of potatoes = Total time to cut up all potatoes
5 seconds × 60 potatoes = 300 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to prep all 60 potatoes.
Total time to peel all potatoes + Total time to cut up all potatoes = Total time to prep all potatoes
5,400 seconds + 300
