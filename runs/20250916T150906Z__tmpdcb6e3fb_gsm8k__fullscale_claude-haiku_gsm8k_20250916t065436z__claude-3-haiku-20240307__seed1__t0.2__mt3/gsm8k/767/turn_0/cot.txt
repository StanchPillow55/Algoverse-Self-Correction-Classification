Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- To make 1 liter of juice, Sam needs 5 kilograms of oranges.
- Each kilogram of oranges costs $3.
- Sam wants to make 4 liters of juice.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oranges needed to make 4 liters of juice.
Oranges needed per liter of juice = 5 kilograms
Oranges needed for 4 liters of juice = 5 kilograms × 4 liters = 20 kilograms

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the oranges.
Cost per kilogram of oranges = $3
Total cost of oranges = 20 kilograms × $3 per kilogram = $60

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.

Final answer: Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.
