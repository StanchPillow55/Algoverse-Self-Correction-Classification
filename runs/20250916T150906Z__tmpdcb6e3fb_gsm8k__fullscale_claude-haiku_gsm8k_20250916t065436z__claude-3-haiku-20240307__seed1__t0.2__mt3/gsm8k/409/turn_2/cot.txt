Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- In May, the company hired 40 employees.
- Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount paid to employees in May.
Number of employees in May = 40
Hourly rate = $15
Hours worked per week = 40
Total pay per employee per month = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in May = 40 × $600 = $24,000

Step 2: Calculate the number of employees in June.
Number of employees in June = 40 - (40 × 1/4) = 40 - 10 = 30

Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid to employees in June.
Total pay per employee per month = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in June = 30 × $600 = $18,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount
