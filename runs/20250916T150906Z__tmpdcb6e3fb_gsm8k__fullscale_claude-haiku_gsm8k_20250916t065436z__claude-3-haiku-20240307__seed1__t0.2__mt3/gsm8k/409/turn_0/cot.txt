To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June.

Given information:
- In May, the company hired 40 employees.
- Each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.
- In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in May.
Number of employees in May = 40
Hourly rate = $15
Weekly hours = 40
Total pay per employee per week = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in May = $600 × 40 = $24,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money paid to the employees in June.
Number of employees in June = 40 - (40 × 1/4) = 40 - 10 = 30
Hourly rate = $15
Weekly hours = 40
Total pay per employee per week = $15 × 40 = $600
Total pay for all employees in June = $600 × 30
