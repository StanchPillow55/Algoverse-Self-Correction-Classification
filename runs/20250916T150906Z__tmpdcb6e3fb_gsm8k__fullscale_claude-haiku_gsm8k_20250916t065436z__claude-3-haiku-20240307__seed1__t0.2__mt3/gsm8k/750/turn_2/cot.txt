Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During the weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs per day.
2. During the weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs per day.
3. We need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out in one 4-week month:
* 4 weeks x 5 weekdays per week = 20 weekdays
* 20 weekdays x 60 chairs per day = 1,200 chairs rented out on weekdays
* 4 weekends x 2 days per weekend = 8 weekend days
* 8 weekend days x 100 chairs per day = 800 chairs rented out on weekends
* Total chairs rented out in one 4-week month = 1,200 + 800 = 2,000 chairs

Now, to find the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months, we simply double the amount:
* 2 x 2
