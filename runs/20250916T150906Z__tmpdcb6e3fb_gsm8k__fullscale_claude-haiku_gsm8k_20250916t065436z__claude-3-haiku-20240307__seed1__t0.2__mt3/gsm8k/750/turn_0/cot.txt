To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays and the weekends, and then add them together to find the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

Given information:
- During the weekdays, 60 chairs are rented each day.
- During the weekends, 100 chairs are rented each day.
- The problem is asking for the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays.
Number of weekdays in a 4-week month = 4 weeks × 5 days per week = 20 days
Number of chairs rented during the weekdays in one 4-week month = 60 chairs per day × 20 days = 1,200 chairs
Number of chairs rented during the weekdays in two 4-week months = 1,200 chairs × 2 = 2,400 chairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekends.
Number of weekend days in a 4-week month = 4
