Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. During the weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs per day.
2. During the weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs per day.
3. We need to find the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out during the weekdays:
* 4 weeks x 5 weekdays per week = 20 weekdays
* 20 weekdays x 60 chairs per day = 1,200 chairs

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented out during the weekends:
* 4 weeks x 2 weekend days per week = 8 weekend days
* 8 weekend days x 100 chairs per day = 800 chairs

Now, we can add the weekday and weekend totals together to get the grand total:
* 1,200 chairs + 800 chairs = 2,000 chairs

Since the question asks for the total in two 4-week months, we need to double the grand total
