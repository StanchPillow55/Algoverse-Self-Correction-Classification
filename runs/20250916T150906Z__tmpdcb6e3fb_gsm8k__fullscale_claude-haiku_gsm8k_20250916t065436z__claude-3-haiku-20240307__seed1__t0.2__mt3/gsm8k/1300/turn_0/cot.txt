To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cars Josh services in 2 weeks and then calculate his total earnings.

Given information:
- Josh services 3 cars a day.
- He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
- He gets paid $4 per car.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days Josh is open in a week.
Number of days open in a week = 7 days - 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 days

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Josh services in a week.
Number of cars serviced per day = 3 cars
Number of cars serviced in a week = 3 cars × 5 days = 15 cars

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars Josh services in 2 weeks.
Number of cars serviced in 2 weeks = 15 cars × 2 weeks = 30 cars

Step 4: Calculate Josh's total earnings in 2 weeks.
Earnings per car = $4
Total earnings in 2 weeks = 30 cars × $4 per car =
