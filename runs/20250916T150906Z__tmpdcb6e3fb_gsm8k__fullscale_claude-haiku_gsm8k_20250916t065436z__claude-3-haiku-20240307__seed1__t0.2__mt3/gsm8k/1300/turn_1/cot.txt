Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josh services 3 cars per day.
2. He is open every day of the week except Sunday and Wednesday.
   * That means he is open 5 days a week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday).
3. He gets paid $4 per car.

To calculate his earnings in 2 weeks, we need to:
* Calculate his daily earnings
* Multiply his daily earnings by the number of days he is open in 2 weeks

Daily earnings:
* 3 cars per day x $4 per car = $12 per day

Days open in 2 weeks:
* 5 days per week x 2 weeks = 10 days

Total earnings in 2 weeks:
* $12 per day x 10 days = $120

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.
