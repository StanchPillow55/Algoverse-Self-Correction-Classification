Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange
* Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange
* They start peeling oranges at the same time

To find how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes):

1) Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:
* Ana can peel 1 orange every 3 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges

2) Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes: 
* Jane can peel 1 orange every 4 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges

3) Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
* Ana peeled 20 oranges, Jane peeled 15 oranges
* Difference = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana
