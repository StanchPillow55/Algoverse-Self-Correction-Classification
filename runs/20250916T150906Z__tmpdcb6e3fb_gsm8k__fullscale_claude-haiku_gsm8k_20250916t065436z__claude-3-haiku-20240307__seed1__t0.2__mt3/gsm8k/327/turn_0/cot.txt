Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
- He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
- He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
- He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
- He eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar has after eating 2 on his way to school.
Number of lollipops after eating 2 = 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar passes out to his friends.
Number of lollipops passed out to friends = 14 lollipops

Step 3: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar buys on his way home.
Number of lollipops bought on the way home = 2 Ã— 14 = 28 lollipops
