Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
2. He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   * 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remaining

3. He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   * 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining

4. He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
   * 14 x 2 = 28 lollipops bought
   * 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops

5. He eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   * 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops

6. He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   * 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops

Therefore, the final number of lollipops Oscar has is 31.
