Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom bought a CD for $4.
- Tom also bought a headphone set.
- The total amount Tom paid was $48.

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
2. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the headphone set.
Total amount paid = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = Total amount paid - Cost of the CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Step 2: Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the remaining money.
If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have had $44 to spend on CDs.
Number of CDs Tom could have bought = Remaining money / Cost of each CD
Number of CDs Tom could have bought = $44 / $4 = 11 CDs

Therefore
