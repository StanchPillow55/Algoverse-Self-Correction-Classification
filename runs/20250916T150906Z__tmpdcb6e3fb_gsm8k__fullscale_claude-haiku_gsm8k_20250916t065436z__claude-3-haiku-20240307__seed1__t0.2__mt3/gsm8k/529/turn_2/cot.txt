Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom bought a CD for $4
- Tom also bought a headphone set
- In total, Tom paid $48

To find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he didn't buy the headphone set, we need to:
1. Calculate the cost of the headphone set
2. Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount he spent

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the headphone set
Total amount spent = $48
Cost of the CD = $4
Cost of the headphone set = Total amount spent - Cost of the CD
Cost of the headphone set = $48 - $4 = $44

Step 2: Determine how many CDs Tom could have bought with the total amount he spent
If Tom didn't buy the headphone set, he would have had $48 to spend on CDs.
Number of CDs he could have bought = Total amount spent / Cost of each CD
Number of CDs he could have bought = $48 / $4 = 12 CDs

Step 3: Calculate
