Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × Tobias' howl duration
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the duration of Igneous' howl.
Igneous' howl duration = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration
Igneous' howl duration = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls.
Combined length of time = Tobias' howl duration + Chikote's howl duration + Igneous' howl duration
Combined length of time = 20 seconds + 40
