Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the length of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl = 2 × Tobias' howl
Chikote's howl = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the length of Igneous' howl.
Igneous' howl = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl
Igneous' howl = 20 seconds + 40 seconds = 60 seconds

Step 3: Calculate the combined length of the three wolves' howls.
Combined length = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl + Igneous' howl
Combined length = 20 seconds + 40 seconds + 60 seconds = 120 seconds

Step 4: Convert the
