Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell.
- Bennet wants to make a total of $135.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggplants.
Revenue from eggplants = 20 eggplants Ã— $3 per eggplant = $60

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount Bennet needs to make from selling the corn.
Remaining amount needed = Total desired revenue - Revenue from eggplants
Remaining amount needed = $135 - $60 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn Bennet needs to charge to make the remaining $75.
Price per ear of corn = Remaining amount needed / Number of ears of corn
Price per ear of corn = $75 / 25 ears of corn = $3 per ear of corn

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 in order to make a total of $135.
