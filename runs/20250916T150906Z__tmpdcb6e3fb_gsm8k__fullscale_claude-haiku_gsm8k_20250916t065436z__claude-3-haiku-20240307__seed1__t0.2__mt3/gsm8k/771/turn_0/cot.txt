To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Bennet can make from selling the eggplants and then calculate the price per ear of corn he needs to charge to reach his desired total of $135.

Given information:
- Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
- Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell.
- Bennet wants to make a total of $135.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Bennet can make from selling the eggplants.
Total money from eggplants = Number of eggplants × Price per eggplant
Total money from eggplants = 20 × $3 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount of money Bennet needs to make from selling the corn.
Remaining amount needed = Desired total - Total money from eggplants
Remaining amount needed = $135 - $60 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the price per ear of corn Bennet needs to charge to make the remaining $75.
Price per ear of corn = Remaining amount neede
