Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, but 6 people returned their pairs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of shoes sold on Saturday.
Shoes sold on Saturday = 2 × Shoes sold on Friday
Shoes sold on Saturday = 2 × 14 = 28 pairs

Step 2: Calculate the number of shoes sold on Sunday.
Shoes sold on Sunday = 1/2 × Shoes sold on Saturday
Shoes sold on Sunday = 1/2 × 28 = 14 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the number of shoes returned on Sunday.
Shoes returned on Sunday = 6 pairs

Step 4: Calculate the total number of shoes sold by the end of the sale.
Total shoes sold = Shoes sold on Friday + Shoes sold on Saturday + Shoes sold on Sunday - Shoes returned on Sunday
