Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Theo has $6000 to spend on his business trip to South Africa.
- He buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
- He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
- He buys a flight ticket that costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
- He wants to save $2000 for the trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the business suits.
Cost of 6 business suits = 6 × $100 = $600

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the suitcases.
Cost of 3 suitcases = 3 × $50 = $150

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the flight ticket.
Cost of a business suit = $100
Cost of the flight ticket = 5 × $100 + $700 = $1200

Step 4: Calculate the total expenses so far.
Total expenses = Cost of business suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
