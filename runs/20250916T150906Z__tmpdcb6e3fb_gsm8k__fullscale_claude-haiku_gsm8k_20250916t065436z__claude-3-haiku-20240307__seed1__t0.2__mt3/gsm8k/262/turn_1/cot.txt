Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box.
   * To find the total number of marbles in the 5 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:
   * 5 boxes x 50 marbles per box = 250 marbles

2. Maddison then gets 20 marbles from her friend.
   * To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the 20 marbles from her friend to the 250 marbles she already had:
   * 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Therefore, the final answer is that Maddison now has 270 marbles.
