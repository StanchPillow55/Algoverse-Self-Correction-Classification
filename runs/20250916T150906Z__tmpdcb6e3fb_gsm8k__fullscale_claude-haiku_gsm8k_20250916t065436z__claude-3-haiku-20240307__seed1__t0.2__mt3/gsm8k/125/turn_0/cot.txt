To solve this problem, we need to find the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

Given information:
- Julia bought a new package of spoons.
- Her husband later bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
- When Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband bought the additional 5 spoons.
Total spoons = Spoons from Julia's package + Spoons from her husband's package
Total spoons = Unknown + 5

Step 2: Find the number of spoons left after Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
Spoons left = Total spoons - Spoons used for sampling
Spoons left = (Unknown + 5) - 3

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the number of spoons in Julia's package.
Spoons left = 12
(Unknown + 5) - 3
