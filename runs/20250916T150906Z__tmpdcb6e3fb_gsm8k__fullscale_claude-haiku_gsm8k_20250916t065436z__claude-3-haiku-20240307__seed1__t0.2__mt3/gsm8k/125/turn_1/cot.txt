Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Julia bought a new package of spoons.
- Her husband later bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
- Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.
- In the end, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.

Let's start by finding the total number of spoons Julia had after her husband gave her the 5 new spoons.
* Total spoons = Spoons from Julia's package + Spoons from husband's package
* Total spoons = X + 5 (where X is the number of spoons in Julia's package)

Now, we know that Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew, so the total number of spoons she had at the end was 12.
* Total spoons = X + 5 - 3 = 12
* X + 2 = 12
* X = 10

Therefore, the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought was 10.

Final answer: The number of spoons in the package that Julia
