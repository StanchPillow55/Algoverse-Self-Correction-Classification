Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Jessa is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Joan's age.
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 years
Joan's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years

Step 2: Find Mary's age.
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 years
Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years

Step 3: Find the sum of the ages of the three girls.
Sum of the ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age
Sum of the ages = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.
