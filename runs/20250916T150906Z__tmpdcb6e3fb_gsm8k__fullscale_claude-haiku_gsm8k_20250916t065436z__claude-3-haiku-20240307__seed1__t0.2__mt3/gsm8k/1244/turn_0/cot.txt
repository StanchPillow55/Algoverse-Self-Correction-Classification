Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.
- The first test has 70 questions, and she gets 60% of them correct.
- The second test has 40 questions.

Step 1: Calculate the number of questions Audrey got correct on the first test.
60% of 70 questions = 0.60 × 70 = 42 questions correct

Step 2: Calculate the total number of questions on both tests.
Total questions = 70 (first test) + 40 (second test) = 110 questions

Step 3: Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct to move on to the 7th grade.
70% of 110 questions = 0.70 × 110 = 77 questions correct

Step 4: Calculate the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test.
Number of questions needed on the second test = Total questions needed - Questions correct on the first test
