Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.

2. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct.
   * 60% of 70 questions = 0.6 x 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.

3. The second test has 40 questions.
   * We need to find how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test to reach the 70% threshold.

4. To calculate the total number of questions:
   * First test: 70 questions
   * Second test: 40 questions
   * Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

5. 70% of 110 questions = 0.7 x 110 = 77 questions needed to be answered correctly.

6. Audrey has already answered 42 questions correctly on the first test.
   * So, the number of questions she needs to get correct on the second test is:
