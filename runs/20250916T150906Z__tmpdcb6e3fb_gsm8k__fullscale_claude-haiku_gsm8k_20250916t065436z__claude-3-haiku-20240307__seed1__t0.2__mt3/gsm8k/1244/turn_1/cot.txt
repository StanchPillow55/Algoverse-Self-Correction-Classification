Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade.
2. The first test has 70 questions, and she got 60% of them correct.
   * 60% of 70 questions = 0.6 x 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.

3. The second test has 40 questions.
4. To calculate the total number of questions, we add the questions from both tests:
   * Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

5. To calculate 70% of the total questions:
   * 70% of 110 questions = 0.7 x 110 = 77 questions

6. Now we need to find out how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test.
   * Total questions she needs to get right = 77
   * Questions she got right on the first test = 42
   * Questions she needs to get right on the second test = 77 - 42 =
