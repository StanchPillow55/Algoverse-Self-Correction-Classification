Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sean has to memorize the lyrics to one solo song, which has 54 lines.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, which means it has 54 x 2 = 108 lines.
   However, only a third of those lines are Sean's, so the number of lines he has to memorize from the first scene is 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, which means it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so the number of lines he has to memorize from the second scene is 60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.

4. To calculate the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we add up the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene:
   54 + 36 + 48 = 138 lines

Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is 138.
