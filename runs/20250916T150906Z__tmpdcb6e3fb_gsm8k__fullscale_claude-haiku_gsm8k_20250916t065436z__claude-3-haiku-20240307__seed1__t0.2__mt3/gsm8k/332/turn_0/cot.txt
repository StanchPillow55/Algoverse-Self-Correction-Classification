Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 220 castles in Scotland.
- 40% of the castles are ruins.
- Half of the ruined castles are unmanned.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ruined castles.
40% of 220 castles = 0.40 ร 220 = 88 ruined castles

Step 2: Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles.
Half of the 88 ruined castles are unmanned = 88 รท 2 = 44 unmanned ruined castles

Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 44.

Final answer: There are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.
