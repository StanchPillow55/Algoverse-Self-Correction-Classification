Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total
- 2 packs were strawberry flavor
- 1 pack was grape flavor and cost $2
- 1 pack was green apple flavor and cost half as much as the grape flavor

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
2. Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid ($7)
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of strawberry gum packs (2)

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $2 / 2 = $1
Total non-strawberry gum cost = $2 + $1 = $3

Step 2: Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid
Total amount paid = $7
Non-strawberry gum cost = $3
