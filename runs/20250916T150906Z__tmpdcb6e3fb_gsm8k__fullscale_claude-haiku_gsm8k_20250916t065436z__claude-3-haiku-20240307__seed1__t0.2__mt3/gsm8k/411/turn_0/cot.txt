Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tim buys a package of fireworks worth $400.
2. He also buys another pack worth twice that much, which is $400 x 2 = $800.
3. He gets a 20% discount on both packages of fireworks.
   * The 20% discount on the $400 package is $400 x 0.20 = $80.
   * The 20% discount on the $800 package is $800 x 0.20 = $160.
   * So the total discount is $80 + $160 = $240.
4. The total cost of the two packages of fireworks after the 20% discount is:
   * $400 - $80 = $320
   * $800 - $160 = $640
   * Total = $320 + $640 = $960
5. Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150.
6. To calculate the total amount Tim spent, we add the cost of the two packages of fireworks after the discount ($960) and the
