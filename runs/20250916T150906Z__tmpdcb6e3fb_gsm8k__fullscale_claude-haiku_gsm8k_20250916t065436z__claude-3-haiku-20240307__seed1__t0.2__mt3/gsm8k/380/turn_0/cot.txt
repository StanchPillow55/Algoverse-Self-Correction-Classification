To solve this problem, we need to find the monthly payment Karan has to make to repay the loan, including the interest.

Given information:
- Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months.
- The interest rate is 10% per annum (per year).

Step 1: Calculate the total interest Karan has to pay.
Total interest = Principal × Interest rate × Time (in years)
Total interest = $3,650 × 0.10 × (5/12) = $152.08

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Karan has to repay.
Total amount to be repaid = Principal + Total interest
Total amount to be repaid = $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be repaid / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.42

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month to repay the loan.

Final answer: Karan has to pay $760.42 per
