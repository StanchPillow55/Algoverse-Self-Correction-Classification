Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Karan borrowed $3,650 for five months.
- The interest rate is 10% per annum (per year).

To find the monthly payment, we need to calculate the total amount Karan has to pay, including the principal and the interest, and then divide it by the number of months.

Step 1: Calculate the total interest Karan has to pay.
Interest rate per annum = 10%
Interest rate per month = 10% / 12 = 0.833%
Total interest = Principal × Interest rate per month × Number of months
Total interest = $3,650 × 0.00833 × 5 = $152.03

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Karan has to pay.
Total amount = Principal + Total interest
Total amount = $3,650 + $152.03 = $3,802.03

Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total amount / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.03 / 5 = $760.
