Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

- John invited 20 people to a birthday party.
- Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
- John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
- A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2.

Step 4: Calculate the number of packs of hot dogs John needs to buy.
Number of packs of hot dogs needed =
