To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit by adding up the individual charges.

Given information:
- Cost of the cast: $200
- Cost of the 30-minute visit: $300/hour for 30 minutes
- Cost of 30 painkillers: $4/pill for 30 pills
- Cost of parking: $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit.
Cost of the 30-minute visit = $300/hour × 0.5 hours = $150

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the 30 painkillers.
Cost of 30 painkillers = $4/pill × 30 pills = $120

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the parking.
Cost of parking = $6/hour × 2 hours = $12

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit.
Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the 30-minute visit + Cost of 30 painkillers + Cost of parking
Total cost = $200
