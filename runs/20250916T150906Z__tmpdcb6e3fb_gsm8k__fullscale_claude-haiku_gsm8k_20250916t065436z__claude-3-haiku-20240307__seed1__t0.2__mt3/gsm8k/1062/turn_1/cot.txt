Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cost of the cast:
   * The doctor charges $200 for the cast.

2. Cost of the visit:
   * The doctor charges $300 per hour.
   * The visit lasts 30 minutes, which is 0.5 hours.
   * So the cost of the visit is $300 x 0.5 = $150.

3. Cost of the painkillers:
   * The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers.
   * Each painkiller costs $4.
   * So the cost of the painkillers is $4 x 30 = $120.

4. Cost of parking:
   * The doctor charges $6 per hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking.
   * So the cost of parking is $6 x 2 = $12.

Now, let's add up all the costs:
* Cost of cast: $200
* Cost of visit: $150
* Cost of painkillers: $120
* Cost of parking: $12
* Total
