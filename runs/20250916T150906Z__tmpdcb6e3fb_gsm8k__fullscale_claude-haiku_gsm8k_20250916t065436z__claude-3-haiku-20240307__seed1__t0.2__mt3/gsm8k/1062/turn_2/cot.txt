Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
- The doctor charges $300/hour for a 30-minute visit.
- The doctor prescribes 30 painkillers at $4/pill.
- The doctor requires a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking at $6/hour.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30-minute visit.
Cost of the 30-minute visit = $300/hour × 0.5 hours = $150

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the painkillers.
Cost of 30 painkillers = $4/pill × 30 pills = $120

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mandatory parking.
Cost of 2 hours of parking = $6/hour × 2 hours = $12

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the doctor's visit.
Total cost = Cost of the cast + Cost of the 30-minute visit + Cost of the painkillers + Cost of the parking
Total cost = $200 + $150
