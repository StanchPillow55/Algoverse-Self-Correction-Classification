Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Convert the coins to their dollar values:
   * 100 pennies = $1.00
   * 40 nickels = $2.00 (40 x $0.05)
   * 20 dimes = $2.00 (20 x $0.10)

2. Add up the coin values:
   * $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 = $5.00

3. Add the dollar bills:
   * 40 dollar bills = $40.00

4. Add the coin value and the dollar bill value to get the total amount:
   * $5.00 + $40.00 = $45.00

Therefore, the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank is $45.00.
