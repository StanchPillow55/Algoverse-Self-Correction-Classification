Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brady has 100 pennies
- Brady has 40 nickels
- Brady has 20 dimes
- Brady has 40 pieces of dollar bills

To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, then add them all together.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the pennies.
Value of pennies = 100 pennies × $0.01 per penny = $1.00

Step 2: Calculate the value of the nickels.
Value of nickels = 40 nickels × $0.05 per nickel = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the value of the dimes.
Value of dimes = 20 dimes × $0.10 per dime = $2.00

Step 4: Calculate the value of the dollar bills.
Value of dollar bills = 40 dollar bills × $1.00 per bill = $40.00

Step 5: Add up the values of all the coins and bills.
