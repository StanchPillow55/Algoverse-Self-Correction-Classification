Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the first player: 6 ounces

2. The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the second player: 8 ounces

3. The third player ate a one-pound steak.
   * 1 pound = 16 ounces
   * Ounces of meat consumed by the third player: 16 ounces

4. The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.

Now, let's add up the total ounces of meat consumed by the team:
* Total ounces of meat consumed = 6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces

Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the basketball team at the steakhouse was 30 ounces.
