To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team.

Given information:
- The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
- The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.
- The third player ate a one-pound steak.
- The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the first player.
Amount of meat consumed by the first player = 6 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the second player.
Amount of meat consumed by the second player = 8 beef tips Ã— 1 ounce per beef tip = 8 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the amount of meat consumed by the third player.
Amount of meat consumed by the third player = 1 pound = 16 ounces

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of meat consumed by the team.
Total amount of meat consumed = Amount of meat consumed by the first player + Amount of meat consumed by the second player + Amount of meat consumed by the third player
