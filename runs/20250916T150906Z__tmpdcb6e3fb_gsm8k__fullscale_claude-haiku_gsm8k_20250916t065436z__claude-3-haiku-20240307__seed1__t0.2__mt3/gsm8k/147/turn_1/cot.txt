Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees 1/2 of that number (30) return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive (30) fly from the hive and leave.
- In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned, returns to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that returned to the hive in the second 6-hour period.
Number of bees that returned = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that left the hive in the third 6-hour period.
Number of bees that left = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Step 3: Calculate the number of bees that had not yet returned to the hive.
