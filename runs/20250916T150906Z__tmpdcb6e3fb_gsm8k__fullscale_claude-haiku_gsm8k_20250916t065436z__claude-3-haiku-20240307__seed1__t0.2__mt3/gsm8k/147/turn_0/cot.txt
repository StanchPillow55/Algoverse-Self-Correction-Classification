To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and keep track of the number of bees leaving and returning to the hive throughout the day.

Given information:
- In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, 1/2 of the 30 bees return to the hive.
- In the next 6 hours, two times as many bees as the first 30 bees leave the hive.
- In the last 6 hours, all the bees that left before but hadn't returned yet, return to the hive.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bees that return to the hive in the second 6 hours.
Number of bees that return in the second 6 hours = 1/2 × 30 = 15 bees

Step 2: Calculate the number of bees that leave the hive in the third 6 hours.
Number of bees that leave in the third 6 hours = 2 × 30 = 60 bees

Step 3:
