To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Vanessa to complete her part of the race.

Given information:
- Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.
- Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did.
- Vanessa ran 4 miles.
- Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

Step 1: Find the distance Aaron ran.
Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, we can divide Vanessa's distance by 2 to find Aaron's distance.
Aaron's distance = Vanessa's distance / 2
Aaron's distance = 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles

Step 2: Find the time it took Aaron to run 1 mile.
Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, and he ran 2 miles.
Time to run 1 mile = Total time / Total distance
Time to run 1 mile = 16 minutes / 2 miles = 8 minutes per mile

Step 3: Find the time it took Vanessa to run 1
