Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chase and Rider can ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days.
- On two other days, they ride their bikes twice the times they do on usual days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days.
Number of times they ride per day × Number of usual days = Total times on usual days
3 times × 5 days = 15 times

Step 2: Calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 2 other days.
Number of times they ride per day on the other days = 2 × 3 = 6 times
Number of other days = 2 days
Total times on the other days = 6 times × 2 days = 12 times

Step 3: Calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week.
Total times on usual days + Total times on other days = Total times in a week
15 times + 12 times = 27 times

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes a
