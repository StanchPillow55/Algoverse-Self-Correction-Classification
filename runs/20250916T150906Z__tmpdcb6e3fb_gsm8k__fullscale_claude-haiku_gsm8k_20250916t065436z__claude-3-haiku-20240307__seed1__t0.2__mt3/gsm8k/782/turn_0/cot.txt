To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week.

Given information:
- Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
- On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days.
Number of times they ride their bikes per day on usual days = 3
Number of usual days = 5
Total number of times they ride their bikes on the 5 usual days = 3 × 5 = 15 times

Step 2: Calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the two other days.
Number of times they ride their bikes per day on the two other days = 3 × 2 = 6 times
Number of other days = 2
Total number of times they ride their bikes on the two other days = 6 × 2 = 12 times

Step 3: Calculate the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week.
