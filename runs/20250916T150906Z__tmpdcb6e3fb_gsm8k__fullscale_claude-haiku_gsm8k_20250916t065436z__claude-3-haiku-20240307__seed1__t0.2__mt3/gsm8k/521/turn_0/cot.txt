Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Chris has a total of 100 math problems to complete.
- On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
- On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems.

Step 1: Calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday.
Problems completed on Tuesday = 3 × 12 = 36 problems

Step 2: Calculate the number of problems remaining after Monday and Tuesday.
Total problems - Problems completed on Monday - Problems completed on Tuesday = Remaining problems
100 - 12 - 36 = 52 problems

Step 3: Calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Wednesday.
Problems completed on Wednesday = 1/4 × 52 = 13 problems

Step 4: Calculate the number of problems remaining after Wednesday.
Remaining problems = Remaining problems after Tuesday - Problems completed on Wednesday
52 - 13 = 39 problems

Therefore, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday
