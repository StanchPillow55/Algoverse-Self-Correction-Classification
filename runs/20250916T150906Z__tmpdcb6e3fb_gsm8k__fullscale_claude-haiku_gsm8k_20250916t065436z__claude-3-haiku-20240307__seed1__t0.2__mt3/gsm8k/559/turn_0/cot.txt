To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
2. Calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks daily.
3. Calculate the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
* The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, so let's assume it is 8 cups.
* Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
* Octavia's daily coffee intake = 8 cups / 2 = 4 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks daily.
* Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
* Juan's daily coffee intake = 4 cups Ã— 10 = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.
* The recommended daily intake of coffee is 4 cups.
* Juan's current daily coffee intake is 40 cups.
* The difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake is:
* 40 cups - 4
