Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
   * Let's say the daily recommended cups of coffee is x.
   * Octavia drinks 1/2 * x cups of coffee.

2. Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.
   * Octavia drinks 1/2 * x cups of coffee.
   * Juan drinks 10 * (1/2 * x) = 5x cups of coffee.

3. Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups.
   * Juan currently drinks 5x cups of coffee.
   * He needs to reduce his intake to 4 cups.
   * The reduction in cups of coffee is 5x - 4 = x - 4 cups.

Therefore, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by x - 4 cups.
