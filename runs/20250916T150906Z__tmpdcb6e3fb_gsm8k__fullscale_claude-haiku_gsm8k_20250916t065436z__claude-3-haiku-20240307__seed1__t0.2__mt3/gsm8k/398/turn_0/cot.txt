To solve this problem, we need to find the number of millipedes, stink bugs, and then the total number of bugs that Nancy counted.

Given information:
- Nancy saw 90 spiders.
- The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the number of spiders.
- The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.

Step 1: Find the number of millipedes.
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × Number of spiders
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × 90 = 30 millipedes

Step 2: Find the number of stink bugs.
Number of stink bugs = 2 × Number of millipedes - 12
Number of stink bugs = 2 × 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Step 3: Find the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs
