Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nancy saw 90 spiders
- The number of millipedes is 1/3rd as many as the number of spiders
- The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12

Step 1: Calculate the number of millipedes.
Number of millipedes = 1/3 × 90 = 30 millipedes

Step 2: Calculate the number of stink bugs.
Number of stink bugs = 2 × 30 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bugs.
Total number of bugs = Number of spiders + Number of millipedes + Number of stink bugs
Total number of bugs = 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs

Therefore, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 168.
