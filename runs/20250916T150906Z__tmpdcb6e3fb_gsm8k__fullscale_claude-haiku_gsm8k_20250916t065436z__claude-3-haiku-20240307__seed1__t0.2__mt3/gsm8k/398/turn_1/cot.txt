Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. She saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders.
   * To find the number of millipedes, we take 1/3 of the number of spiders:
   * 1/3 of 90 = 30 millipedes

3. The number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12.
   * Number of millipedes = 30
   * Twice the number of millipedes = 2 x 30 = 60
   * Subtract 12 from 60 to get the number of stink bugs:
   * 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

4. To find the total number of bugs, we add up the spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:
   * Spiders: 90
   * Millipedes: 30
   * Stink bugs: 48
   * Total: 90 + 30 + 48 =
