Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

To find the number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total school population, and then subtract the number of boys from the total to get the number of girls.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can use the following equation:
40% of total population = 240 boys
Total population = 240 boys / 0.40 (40% expressed as a decimal)
Total population = 600 students

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.
Total population = Number of boys + Number of girls
600 = 240 + Number of girls
Number of girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.
