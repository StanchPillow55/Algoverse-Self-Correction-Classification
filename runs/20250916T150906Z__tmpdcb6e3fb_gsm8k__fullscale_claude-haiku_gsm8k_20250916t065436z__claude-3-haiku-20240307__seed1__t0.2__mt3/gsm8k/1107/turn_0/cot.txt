To solve this problem, we need to find the total school population and then calculate the number of girls in the school.

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can use the following equation to find the total school population:
40% of total school population = 240 boys
Total school population = 240 boys / 0.40
Total school population = 600 students

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.
Total school population = 600 students
Number of boys = 240 students
Number of girls = Total school population - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240 = 360 girls

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

Final answer: There are 360 girls in the school.
