Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total of their ages is 162.

Step 1: Let's represent Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common factor.

Step 2: We know that the total of their ages is 162, so we can set up an equation:
7x + 11x = 162
18x = 162
x = 9

Step 3: Now we can calculate Darrell's age and Allen's age:
Darrell's age = 7x = 7 × 9 = 63
Allen's age = 11x = 11 × 9 = 99

Step 4: To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age:
Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.
