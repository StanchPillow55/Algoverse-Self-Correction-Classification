Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Step 1: Find Darrell's age and Allen's age.
Let Darrell's age be x and Allen's age be y.
According to the given ratio, we have:
x : y = 7 : 11
x = 7k and y = 11k, where k is a constant.

The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162, so:
x + y = 162
7k + 11k = 162
18k = 162
k = 9

Therefore, Darrell's age (x) = 7 × 9 = 63 years
Allen's age (y) = 11 × 9 = 99 years

Step 2: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.
Allen's age 10 years from now = Allen's current age + 10
Allen's age 10 years from now =
