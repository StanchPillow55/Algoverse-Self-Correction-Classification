Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jairus gets $0.8 for each small task accomplished.
2. Jenny gets $0.5 for each small task accomplished.
3. Each of them finished 20 tasks.

To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, we need to calculate the total amount each of them earned.

Jairus's total earnings:
* 20 tasks x $0.8 per task = $16

Jenny's total earnings:
* 20 tasks x $0.5 per task = $10

Now, to find the difference:
* Jairus's total earnings - Jenny's total earnings = $16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.
