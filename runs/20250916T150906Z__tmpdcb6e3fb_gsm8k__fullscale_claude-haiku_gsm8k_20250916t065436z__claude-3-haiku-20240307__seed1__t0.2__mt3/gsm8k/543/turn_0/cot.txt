Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jairus gets $0.8 for each small task accomplished.
- Jenny gets $0.5 for each small task accomplished.
- Each of them finished 20 tasks.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jairus will get.
Jairus's earnings per task = $0.8
Number of tasks completed by Jairus = 20
Total amount Jairus will get = $0.8 × 20 = $16

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Jenny will get.
Jenny's earnings per task = $0.5
Number of tasks completed by Jenny = 20
Total amount Jenny will get = $0.5 × 20 = $10

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Jairus's and Jenny's earnings.
Difference = Jairus's earnings - Jenny's earnings
Difference = $16 - $10 = $6

Therefore, Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.

Final answer: Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.
