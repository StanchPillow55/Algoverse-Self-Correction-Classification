To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Matteo and Shandy, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.
- Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by Matteo.
Matteo's distance = Speed × Time
Matteo's distance = 55 miles per hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled by Shandy.
Shandy's distance = Speed × Time
Shandy's distance = 45 miles per hour × 10 hours = 450 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Shandy's and Matteo's distances.
Difference in distance = Shandy's distance - Matteo's distance
Difference in distance = 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

Therefore, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.

Final answer: Shandy drove 230 miles far
