Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies, 3 of which have spots.
- Brandon's dog has 12 puppies, 4 of which have spots.

Step 1: Find the total number of puppies.
Total number of puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
Total number of puppies = 8 + 12 = 20 puppies

Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots.
Total number of puppies with spots = Jennifer's puppies with spots + Brandon's puppies with spots
Total number of puppies with spots = 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.
Percentage of puppies with spots = (Total number of puppies with spots / Total number of puppies) × 100
Percentage of puppies with spots = (7 / 20) × 100 = 35%

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.
