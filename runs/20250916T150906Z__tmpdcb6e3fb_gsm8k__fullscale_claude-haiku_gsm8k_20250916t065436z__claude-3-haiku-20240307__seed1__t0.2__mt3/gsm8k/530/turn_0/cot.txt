To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, considering the given information.

Given information:
- Josh spent 4 hours working out every week, except on some occasions.
- At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
- Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.

Step 1: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the weeks where he spent 4 hours.
Number of weeks where he spent 4 hours = 8 weeks - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks
Total hours spent working out in the 5 weeks = 5 weeks × 4 hours = 20 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours.
Total hours spent working out in the two consecutive weeks = 2 weeks × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total hours spent working out in the one week where he spent 6 hours.
Total hours spent working
