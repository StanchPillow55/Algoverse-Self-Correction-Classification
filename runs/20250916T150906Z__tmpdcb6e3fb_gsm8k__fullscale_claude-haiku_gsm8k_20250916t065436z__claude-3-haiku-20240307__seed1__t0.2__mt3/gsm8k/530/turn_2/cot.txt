Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Josh tracked his workout routine for 8 weeks.
- He spent 4 hours working out every week, except on some occasions.
- At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks.
- Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.

To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks, we need to calculate the hours for each week and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the hours for the weeks where he spent 4 hours working out.
Number of weeks with 4 hours = 8 weeks - 2 weeks (5 hours) - 1 week (6 hours) = 5 weeks

Step 2: Calculate the hours for the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours.
Total hours for 2 weeks = 2 weeks × 5 hours = 10 hours

Step 3: Calculate the hours for the
