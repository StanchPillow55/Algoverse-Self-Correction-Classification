Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra
- Alexandra raises $430
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah
- Sarah raises $300

Step 1: Calculate how much Kim raised.
Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
Kim's amount = $430 + $320 = $750

Step 2: Calculate how much Maryam raised.
Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
Maryam's amount = $300 + $400 = $700

Step 3: Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls.
Total amount raised = Alexandra's amount + Kim's amount + Sarah's amount + Maryam's amount
Total amount raised = $430 + $750 + $300 + $700 = $2,180

Therefore, the total amount of money raised by the girls for the carnival is $2,180.
