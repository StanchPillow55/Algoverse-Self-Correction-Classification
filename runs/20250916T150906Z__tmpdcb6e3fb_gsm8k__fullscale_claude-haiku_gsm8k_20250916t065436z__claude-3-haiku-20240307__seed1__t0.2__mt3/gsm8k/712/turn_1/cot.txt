Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- We need to find how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.
Ginger's candy after two weeks = 100 - (4 pieces/day × 14 days) = 100 - 56 = 44 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.
Amy's candy after two weeks = 100 - (3 pieces/day × 14 days) = 100 - 42 = 58 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy.
Difference = Amy's candy - Ginger's candy = 58 - 44 = 14 pieces

Therefore, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.
