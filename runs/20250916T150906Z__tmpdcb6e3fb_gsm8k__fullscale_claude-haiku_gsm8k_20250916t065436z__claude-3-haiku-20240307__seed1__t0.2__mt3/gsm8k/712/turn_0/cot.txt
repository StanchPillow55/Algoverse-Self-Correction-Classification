Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- We want to find how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.
Ginger's candy per day = 4 pieces
Ginger's candy in two weeks = 4 pieces/day × 14 days = 56 pieces
Ginger's remaining candy = 100 pieces - 56 pieces = 44 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.
Amy's candy per day = 3 pieces
Amy's candy in two weeks = 3 pieces/day × 14 days = 42 pieces
Amy's remaining candy = 100 pieces - 42 pieces = 58 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Amy's and Ginger's remaining candy.
Difference = Amy's remaining candy -
