Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.

Step 1: Find Emil's age when he turns 24.
Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years

Step 2: Find the relationship between Emil's age and his dad's age when Emil turns 24.
When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
Emil's age / Dad's age = 1/2
24 / Dad's age = 1/2
Dad's age = 48 years

Step 3: Find the relationship between Emil's age and his brother's age when Emil turns 24.
When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
Emil's age / Brother's age = 2
24 / Brother's age = 2
Brother's age = 12 years

Step 4: Find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now.
Dad's age now = 48
