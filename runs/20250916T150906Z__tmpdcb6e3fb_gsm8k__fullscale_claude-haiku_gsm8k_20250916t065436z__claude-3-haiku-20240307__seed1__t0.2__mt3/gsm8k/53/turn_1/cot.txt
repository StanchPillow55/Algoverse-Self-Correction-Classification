Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired.
- The mechanic charges $40 for each car tire repaired.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and 0 truck tires.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday.
Revenue from truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
Revenue from car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520

Step 2: Calculate the revenue earned on Friday.
Revenue from truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
Revenue from car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
Total revenue on Friday = $0 + $480 = $480

Step 3: Determine which day had the higher revenue.
Thursday's revenue
