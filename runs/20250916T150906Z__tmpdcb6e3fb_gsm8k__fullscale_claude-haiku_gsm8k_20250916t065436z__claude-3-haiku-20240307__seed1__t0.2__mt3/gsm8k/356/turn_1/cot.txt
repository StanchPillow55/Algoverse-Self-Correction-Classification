Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store.
- Dean bought 6 toy cars, each costing $2.
- Dean bought 5 teddy bears, each costing $1.

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Dean had left after the initial $28.
Amount of money left = Initial amount given - Total amount spent
Amount of money left = $28 - $17 = $11

Step 5: Calculate the final amount of money Dean has after his
