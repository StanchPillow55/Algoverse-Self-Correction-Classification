Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ice cream tub:
   - Original price: $13
   - Discounted price: $11
   - Savings per tub: $13 - $11 = $2

2. Milk packet:
   - Original price: unknown
   - Discounted price: $0.5 less than original price

3. Calculating the total savings:
   - 2 tubs of ice cream: 2 × $2 = $4 saved
   - 4 packets of milk: 4 × $0.5 = $2 saved
   - Total savings: $4 + $2 = $6

Therefore, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is $6.
