Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We need to find the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
   * Days 1 and 2: 50 birds
   * Day 3: 0 birds
   * Days 4 and 5: 120 birds
   * Day 6: 20 birds
   * Day 7: 90 birds
   * Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

2. To find the average number of birds seen per day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days.
   * Number of days = 7
   * Average birds per day = 280 birds / 7 days = 40 birds

Therefore, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 40 birds.
