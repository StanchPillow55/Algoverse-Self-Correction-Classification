Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On days 1 and 2, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day 3, Mack saw 0 birds.
- On days 4 and 5, Mack saw 120 birds.
- On day 6, Mack saw 20 birds.
- On day 7, Mack saw 90 birds.

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
2. Divide the total number of birds by the number of days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the 7 days.
Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120
