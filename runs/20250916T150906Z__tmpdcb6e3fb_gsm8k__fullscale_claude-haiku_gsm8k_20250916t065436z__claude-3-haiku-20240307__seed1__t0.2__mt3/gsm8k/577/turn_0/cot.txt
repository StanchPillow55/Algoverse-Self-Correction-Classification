To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of birds Mack saw over the week and then divide it by the number of days to get the average number of birds seen per day.

Given information:
- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three, he saw none.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six, he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week.
Birds seen on days 1 and 2 = 50
Birds seen on day 3 = 0
Birds seen on days 4 and 5 = 120
Birds seen on day 6 = 20
Birds seen on day 7 = 90
Total birds seen = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Mack observed the birds.
Number of days = 7

Step 3: Calculate the
