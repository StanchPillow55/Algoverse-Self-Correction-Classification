Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Elvis starts driving from his house and travels west for 5 hours.
   * At an average speed of 18 mph, he travels 18 mph x 5 hours = 90 miles west.

2. Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours.
   * At an average speed of 18 mph, he travels 18 mph x 8 hours = 144 miles east.

3. To find how far he is from his house now, we need to subtract the distance traveled west from the distance traveled east.
   * 144 miles east - 90 miles west = 54 miles east of his house.

Therefore, the final answer is that Elvis is 54 miles east of his house.
