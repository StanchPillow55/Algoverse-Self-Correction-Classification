To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Elvis traveled and then calculate his current distance from his house.

Given information:
- Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Elvis then turns around and travels east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled while driving west.
Distance traveled while driving west = Average speed × Time
Distance traveled while driving west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled while driving east.
Distance traveled while driving east = Average speed × Time
Distance traveled while driving east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled while driving west + Distance traveled while driving east
Total distance traveled = 90 miles + 144 miles = 234 miles

Step 4: Calculate Elvis's current distance from his house.
Since Elvis started at his house, traveled west for 5 hours, and then turned around and traveled east for 8 hours, he is now back at
