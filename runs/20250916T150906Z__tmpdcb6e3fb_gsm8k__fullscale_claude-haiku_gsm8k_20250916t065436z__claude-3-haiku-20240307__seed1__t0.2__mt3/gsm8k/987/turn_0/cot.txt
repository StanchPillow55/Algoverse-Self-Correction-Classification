To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations.
2. Subtract the amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available.
3. Determine the number of roses that can be planted with the remaining soil.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of soil needed for the sunflowers and carnations.
* 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds per sunflower = 12 pounds of soil
* 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds per carnation = 15 pounds of soil
* Total soil needed for sunflowers and carnations = 12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Step 2: Subtract the amount of soil used for the sunflowers and carnations from the total amount of soil available.
* Total soil available = 30 pounds
* Soil used for sunflowers and carnations = 27 pounds
* Remaining soil = 30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Step 3: Determine the number of
