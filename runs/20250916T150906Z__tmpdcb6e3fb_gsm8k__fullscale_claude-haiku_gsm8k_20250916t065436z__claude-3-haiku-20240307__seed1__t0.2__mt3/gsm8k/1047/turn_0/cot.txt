Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- In the first set, Rory had to retrieve 4 more balls than in the second set.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.
- Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of balls retrieved in the second set.
- Then, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.
- The number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2.

We know that the total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can write an equation:
x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Solving this equation:
x + x + 4 + x/2 = 19
2.5x + 4 = 19
2.5x = 15
x = 6

Now, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
Balls retrieved in the first set = x + 4 = 6 +
