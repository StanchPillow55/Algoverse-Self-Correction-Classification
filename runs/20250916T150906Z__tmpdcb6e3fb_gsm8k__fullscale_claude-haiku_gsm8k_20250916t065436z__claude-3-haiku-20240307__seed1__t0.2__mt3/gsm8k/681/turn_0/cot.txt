Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can say that:
Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies

Step 2: Find the number of cookies that the Cookie Monster has.

Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:
Summer's cookies = Max's cookies + 23
Summer's cookies =
