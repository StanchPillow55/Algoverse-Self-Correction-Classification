Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- James found a quarter, two nickels, and 7 dimes in the coin return of the vending machine.

To find the total amount of money in cents, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the quarter.
1 quarter = 25 cents

Step 2: Calculate the value of the two nickels.
2 nickels = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents

Step 3: Calculate the value of the 7 dimes.
7 dimes = 7 × 10 cents = 70 cents

Step 4: Add the values of all the coins together.
Total value = Value of quarter + Value of nickels + Value of dimes
Total value = 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents
Total value = 105 cents

Therefore, James has 105 cents in the coin return of the vending machine.

Final answer: James has 105 cents.
