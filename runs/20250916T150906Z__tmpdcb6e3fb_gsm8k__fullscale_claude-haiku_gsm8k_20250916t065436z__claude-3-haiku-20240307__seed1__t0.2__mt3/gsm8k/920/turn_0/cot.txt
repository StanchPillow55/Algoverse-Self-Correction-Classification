Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Larry has 3 cats.
- Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats.
- Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs.
- Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits.
- Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dogs.
Number of dogs = 3 × Number of cats
Number of dogs = 3 × 3 = 9 dogs

Step 2: Calculate the number of rabbits.
Number of rabbits = Number of dogs - 2
Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish.
Number of fish = 3 × Number of rabbits
Number of fish = 3 × 7 = 21 fish

Step 4: Calculate the number of gerbils.
Number of gerbils = 1/3 × Number of fish
Number of g
