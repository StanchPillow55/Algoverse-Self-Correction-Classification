Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so:
   * Number of dogs = 3 x 3 = 9 dogs

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so:
   * Number of rabbits = 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so:
   * Number of fish = 3 x 7 = 21 fish

5. He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so:
   * Number of gerbils = 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils

Now, let's add up all the pets:
* 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = 47 pets

Therefore, the total number of pets Larry has is 47.
