Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.
- A gallon jar costs $5.

Step 1: Find the cost of a half-gallon jar.
Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, we can subtract $2 from the cost of a gallon jar to find the cost of a half-gallon jar.
Cost of a half-gallon jar = Cost of a gallon jar - $2
Cost of a half-gallon jar = $5 - $2 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallon jars.
Total cost of 10 gallon jars = 10 × $5 = $50

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 16 half-gallon jars.
Total cost of 16 half-gallon jars = 16 × $3 = $48

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent.
Total amount spent = Total cost of
