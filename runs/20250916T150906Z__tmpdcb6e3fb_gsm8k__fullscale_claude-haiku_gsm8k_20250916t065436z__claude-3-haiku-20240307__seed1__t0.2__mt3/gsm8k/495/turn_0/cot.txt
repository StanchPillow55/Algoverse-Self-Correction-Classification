Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charisma works for 8 hours every day.
- She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour she's at work.
- We need to find out how many minutes she has walked after 5 days at the office.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times Charisma gets up and walks per day.
Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, and she works for 8 hours per day, she gets up and walks 8 times per day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks per day.
Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, the total number of minutes she walks per day is:
8 times × 5 minutes = 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes Charisma walks over 5 days.
Since she walks for 40 minutes per day, the total number of minutes she walks over 5 days is:
40 minutes × 5 days = 200 minutes
