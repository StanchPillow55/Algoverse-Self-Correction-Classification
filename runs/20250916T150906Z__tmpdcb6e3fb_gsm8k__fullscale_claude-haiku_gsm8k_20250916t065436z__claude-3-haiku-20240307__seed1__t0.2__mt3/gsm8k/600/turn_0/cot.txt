Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Jamaal is initially using an 8-pound weight.

2. He increases the weight by 50%. To calculate the new weight:
   * 50% of 8 pounds = 0.5 Ã— 8 = 4 pounds
   * New weight = 8 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

3. The 12-pound weight is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds lighter.
   * Weight that he now uses = 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds

Therefore, the weight that Jamaal now uses is 10 pounds.

Final answer: 10 pounds
