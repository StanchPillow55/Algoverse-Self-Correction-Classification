To solve this problem, we need to find the number of pages Shiela has left to write for her research paper.

Given information:
- The research paper is required to be 15 pages long.
- Shiela has already finished writing 1/3 of the paper.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has already written.
1/3 of 15 pages = 1/3 Ã— 15 = 5 pages

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Shiela has left to write.
Total pages required - Pages already written = Pages left to write
15 pages - 5 pages = 10 pages

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper.

Final answer: Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper.
