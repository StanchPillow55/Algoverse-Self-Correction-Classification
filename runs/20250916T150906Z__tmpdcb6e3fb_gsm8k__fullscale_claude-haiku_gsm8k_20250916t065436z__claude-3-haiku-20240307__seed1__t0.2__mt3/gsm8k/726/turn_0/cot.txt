To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the information about the length of Topher's shoes.

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to inches.
8 feet and 4 inches = (8 Ã— 12) + 4 = 100 inches

Step 2: Find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Let the length of one of Bobby's shoes be x inches.
The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10
100 inches = 9x + 10
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 10 inches

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is
