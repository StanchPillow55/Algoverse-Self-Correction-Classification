Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The bagel costs $4.
- The soup costs 25% more than the bagel.
- The cake costs half the price of the bagel.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the soup.
Cost of the soup = Cost of the bagel + 25% of the cost of the bagel
Cost of the soup = $4 + (0.25 × $4) = $4 + $1 = $5

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cake.
Cost of the cake = 1/2 × Cost of the bagel
Cost of the cake = 1/2 × $4 = $2

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner.
Total cost = Cost of the bagel + Cost of the soup + Cost of the cake
Total cost = $4 + $5 + $2 = $11

Therefore, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for the dinner she ordered.
