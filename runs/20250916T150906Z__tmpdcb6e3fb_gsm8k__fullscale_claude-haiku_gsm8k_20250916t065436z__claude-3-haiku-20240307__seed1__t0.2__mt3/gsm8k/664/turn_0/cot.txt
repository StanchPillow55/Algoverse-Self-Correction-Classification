Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The cooking class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class session lasts 2 hours.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.
- John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours in the cooking class.
Number of hours per week = 4 classes × 2 hours per class = 8 hours per week
Total number of hours in the class = 8 hours per week × 6 weeks = 48 hours

Step 2: Calculate the number of recipes John learns.
Number of recipes learned = Total number of hours in the class / Time required to learn a new recipe
Number of recipes learned = 48 hours / 1.5 hours per recipe = 32 recipes

Therefore, John learns 32 recipes in the cooking class.
