Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Movie super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket and a popcorn with a soda for $1 extra.
- Regular movie ticket costs $12.
- Soda costs $3.
- If you didn't buy the super ticket, you ended up saving $2.

To find the regular price of the popcorn, we need to set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the regular price of the popcorn.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of buying a regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda.
Regular movie ticket + Popcorn + Soda = $12 + x + $3 = $15 + x

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of buying the movie super ticket.
Movie super ticket + $1 (for popcorn and soda) = $20 + $1 = $21

Step 3: Set up the equation to find the savings.
Total cost of regular ticket, popcorn, and soda - Total
