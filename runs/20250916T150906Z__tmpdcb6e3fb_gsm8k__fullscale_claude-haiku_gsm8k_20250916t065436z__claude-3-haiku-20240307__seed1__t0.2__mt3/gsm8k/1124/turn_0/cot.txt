To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final result to find the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning.

Given information:
- Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
- Luis used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.
- Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob.

Step 1: Find the number of stickers Kris received from Luis.
Kris received the remaining stickers from Luis, which is half of the stickers Luis had.
Kris received = 9 + 7 = 16 stickers

Step 2: Find the number of stickers Luis had.
Luis had twice the number of stickers Kris received, as he used half of the stickers and gave the rest to Kris.
Luis had = 16 Ã— 2 = 32 stickers

Step 3: Find the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis.
Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so the number of stickers Seth gave to Luis is equal to the number of stickers Luis had.
