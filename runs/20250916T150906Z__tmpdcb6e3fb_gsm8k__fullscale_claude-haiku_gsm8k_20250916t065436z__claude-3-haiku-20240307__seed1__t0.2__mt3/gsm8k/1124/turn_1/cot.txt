Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.
   * Let's say Seth had 'x' stickers to begin with.
   * Seth gave half of 'x' stickers to Luis, which is 'x/2' stickers.

2. Luis used half of the stickers he received from Seth.
   * Luis received 'x/2' stickers from Seth.
   * Luis used half of those, which is '(x/2)/2 = x/4' stickers.
   * Luis had the remaining '(x/2) - (x/4) = x/4' stickers left.

3. Luis gave the remaining stickers to Kris.
   * Luis had 'x/4' stickers left.
   * Luis gave all of those stickers to Kris.

4. Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 to Rob.
   * Kris received 'x/4' stickers from Luis.
   * Kris kept 9 stickers
