Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A magazine costs half as much as a book.
- The book costs $4.
- A pen costs $1 less than a magazine.

Step 1: Find the cost of the magazine.
Since the magazine costs half as much as the book, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
Cost of the magazine = 1/2 × Cost of the book
Cost of the magazine = 1/2 × $4 = $2

Step 2: Find the cost of the pen.
The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so we can calculate the cost of the pen as follows:
Cost of the pen = Cost of the magazine - $1
Cost of the pen = $2 - $1 = $1

Therefore, the pen costs $1.

Final answer: The pen costs $1.
