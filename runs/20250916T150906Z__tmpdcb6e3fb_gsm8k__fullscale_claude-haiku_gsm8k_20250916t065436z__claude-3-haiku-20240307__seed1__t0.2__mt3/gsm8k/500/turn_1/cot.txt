Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Then, David found x/2 insects.
- And Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of insects Lily found.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write:
Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects = 43
x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Simplifying the equation:
2x + x + x/2 + 7 = 43
3.5x + 7 = 43
3.5x = 36
x = 10.29 (rounded to two decimal places)

Now, we can calculate the number of insects Lily
