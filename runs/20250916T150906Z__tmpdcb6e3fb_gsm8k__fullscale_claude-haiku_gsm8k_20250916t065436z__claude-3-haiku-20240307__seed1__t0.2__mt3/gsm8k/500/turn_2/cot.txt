Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Then, David found x/2 insects.
- And Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43, so we can write an equation:
Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects = 43
x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Simplifying the equation:
2x + x + x/2 + 7 = 43
3.5x + 7 = 43
3.5x = 36
x = 10.29 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the number of insects must be a whole number, we can round down to 10.
Therefore
