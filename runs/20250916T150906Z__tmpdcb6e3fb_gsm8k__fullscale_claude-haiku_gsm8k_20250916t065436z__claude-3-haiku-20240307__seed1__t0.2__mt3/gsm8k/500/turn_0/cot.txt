Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's start by representing the number of insects found by each person with variables:
- Let x = the number of insects found by Bodhi.
- Let y = the number of insects found by David.
- Let z = the number of insects found by Lily.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of insects found by each person.
David found half of what Bodhi found, so:
y = x/2

Lily found 7 more than David, so:
z = y + 7

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of insects collected.
Total insects collected = Bodhi's insects + David's insects + Lily's insects
43 = x + y + z

Step 3: Substitute the expressions for y and z into the equation.
43 = x + (x/2) + (x/2
