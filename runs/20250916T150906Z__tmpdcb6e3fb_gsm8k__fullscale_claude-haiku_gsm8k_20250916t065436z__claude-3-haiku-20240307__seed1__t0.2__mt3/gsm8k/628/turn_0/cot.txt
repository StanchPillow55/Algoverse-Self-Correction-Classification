To solve this problem, we need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow from his current height of 40 inches to the required height of 48 inches (4 feet) to ride the biggest roller coaster.

Given information:
- Adam's current height is 40 inches.
- Adam grows 2 inches per year.
- The required height to ride the roller coaster is 48 inches (4 feet).

Step 1: Convert the required height from feet to inches.
Required height in inches = 4 feet Ã— 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate the additional height Adam needs to grow to reach the required height.
Additional height needed = Required height - Current height
Additional height needed = 48 inches - 40 inches = 8 inches

Step 3: Calculate the number of years it will take for Adam to grow the additional 8 inches.
Number of years = Additional height needed / Growth rate per year
Number of years = 8 inches / 2 inches per year = 4 years

Therefore, it will take 4 years for Adam to grow from
