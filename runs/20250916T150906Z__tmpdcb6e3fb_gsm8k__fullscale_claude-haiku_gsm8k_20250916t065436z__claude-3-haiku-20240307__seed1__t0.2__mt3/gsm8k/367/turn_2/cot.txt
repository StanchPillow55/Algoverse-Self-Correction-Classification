Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks
- A number of customers were kicked out for shoplifting, which equals 4 times the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks, minus 5
- 3 times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale
- A total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart

Step 1: Find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
Number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks = 3
Number of customers kicked out for shoplifting = 4 × 3 - 5 = 7

Step 2: Find the number of customers kicked out for physical violence.
Number of customers kicked out for physical violence = 3 × 7 = 21

Step 3: Find the total number of customers kicked out for the given reasons.
Total number of customers kicked out for the given reasons = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31

Step 4: Find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons.
