To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

Given information:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater.
Time for Wayne to get to the theater = 4 minutes
Time for Bernadette to get to the theater = 4 Ã— 4 = 16 minutes

Step 2: Find the time difference between Bernadette's arrival and Wayne's arrival.
Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
Time difference = 5 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.
Time for Bernadette to get to the theater = 16 minutes
Time for Wayne to get to the theater = 4 minutes
Time difference = 16
