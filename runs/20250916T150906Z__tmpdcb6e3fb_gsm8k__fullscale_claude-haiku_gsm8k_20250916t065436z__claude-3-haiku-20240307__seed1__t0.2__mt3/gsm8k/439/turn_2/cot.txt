Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater.
Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette as follows:
Time for Bernadette = 4 Ã— 4 minutes = 16 minutes

Step 2: Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.
Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to add 5 minutes to the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater:
Time Bernadette should leave = 16 minutes + 5 minutes = 21 minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave
