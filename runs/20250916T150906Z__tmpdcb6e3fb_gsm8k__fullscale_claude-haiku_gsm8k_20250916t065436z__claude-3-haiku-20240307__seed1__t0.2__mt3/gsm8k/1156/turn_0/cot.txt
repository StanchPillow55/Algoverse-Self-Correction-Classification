Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
- Linus sells the mobile device for twice the amount of the original price.
- Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of each mobile device.
Selling price = 2 × Original price
Selling price = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the profit per mobile device.
Profit per device = Selling price - Original price
Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total profit from the devices bought last Monday.
Total profit from Monday = Profit per device × Number of devices bought on Monday
Total profit from Monday = $20 × 2 = $40

Step 4: Calculate the total profit from the devices bought last Tuesday.
Total profit from Tuesday = Profit per device × Number of devices bought on Tuesday
Total profit from Tuesday = $20 × 4 = $80

Step 5: Calculate the total profit
