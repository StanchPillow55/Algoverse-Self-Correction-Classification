Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- There is an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 yellow blocks

Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8 = 12 blocks

Step 3: Determine the number of red blocks.
We know the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, and we have calculated the number of blue and yellow blocks as 12.
Therefore, the number of red blocks can be found by subtracting the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total
