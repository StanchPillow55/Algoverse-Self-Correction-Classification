Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- The tower has an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Find the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 Ã— 4 = 8 yellow blocks

Step 2: Find the number of red blocks.
We know the total number of blocks is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks. So we can calculate the number of red blocks by subtracting the blue and yellow blocks from the total:
Total blocks = 32
Blue blocks = 4
Yellow blocks = 8
Red blocks = Total blocks - Blue blocks - Yellow blocks
Red blocks = 32 - 4 - 8 = 20 red blocks

Therefore, the tower has 20 red blocks.
