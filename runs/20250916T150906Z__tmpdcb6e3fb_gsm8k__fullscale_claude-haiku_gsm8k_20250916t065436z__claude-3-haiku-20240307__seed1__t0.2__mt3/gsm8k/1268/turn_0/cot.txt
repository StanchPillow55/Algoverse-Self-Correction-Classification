Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- The tower has twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- The tower has an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 yellow blocks

Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks.
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = Number of blue blocks + Number of yellow blocks
Total number of blue and yellow blocks = 4 + 8 = 12 blocks

Step 3: Determine the number of red blocks.
Since the total number of blocks in the tower is 32, and we know the number of blue and yellow blocks is 12, we can calculate the number of red blocks as:
Number of red blocks = Total number of blocks - Number of blue an
