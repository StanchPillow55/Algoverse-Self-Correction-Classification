Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
2. Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   * 1/5 of 1000 = 200 beds are occupied initially.
   * Therefore, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

3. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
   * Over 2 weeks (14 days), the total number of new patients admitted is 50 x 14 = 700 patients.

4. To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks:
   * Initial unoccupied beds: 800
   * New patients admitted over 2 weeks: 700
   * Total unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = 800 - 700 = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds.
