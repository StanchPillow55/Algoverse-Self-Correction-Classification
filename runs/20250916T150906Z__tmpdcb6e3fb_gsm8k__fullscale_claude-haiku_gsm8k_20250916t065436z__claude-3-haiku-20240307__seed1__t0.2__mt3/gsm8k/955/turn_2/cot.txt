Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds.
- 1/5 of the beds are currently occupied.
- 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day.
- We need to calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beds that are currently occupied.
Total beds = 1000
Occupied beds = 1/5 of 1000 = 1000 × 1/5 = 200 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of beds that will be occupied after 2 weeks.
Patients admitted per day = 50
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14
Total patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 × 14 = 700 patients
Total occupied beds after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.
Total beds = 1000
