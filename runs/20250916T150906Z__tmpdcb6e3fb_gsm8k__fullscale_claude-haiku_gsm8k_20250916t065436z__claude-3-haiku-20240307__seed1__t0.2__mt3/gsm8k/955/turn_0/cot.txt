To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
2. Calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
Number of occupied beds initially = 1/5 × 1000 = 200 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.
The hospital admits 50 patients each day.
Number of days in 2 weeks = 14 days
Total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks = 50 patients/day × 14 days = 700 patients
Number of beds occupied after 2 weeks = Initial occupied beds + Patients admitted in 2 weeks
Number of beds occupied after 2 weeks = 200 + 700 = 900 beds

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.
Number of unocc
