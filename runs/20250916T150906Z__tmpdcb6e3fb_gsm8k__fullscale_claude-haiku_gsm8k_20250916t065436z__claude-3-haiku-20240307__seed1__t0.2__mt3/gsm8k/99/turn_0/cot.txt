Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary had before receiving the new ones.
Number of window ledges × Number of potted plants per ledge = Total number of potted plants
40 × 2 = 80 potted plants

Step 2: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has after receiving the new ones.
Total number of potted plants before + Number of new potted plants = Total number of potted plants after
80 + 18 = 98 potted plants

Step 3: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away to friends and family.
Number of window ledges = Number of potted plants to be given away
40 potted plants

Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will remain with.
