Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
   * Total number of potted plants on the window ledges = 2 plants x 40 ledges = 80 plants

2. Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
   * Total number of potted plants Mary has now = 80 plants + 18 new plants = 98 plants

3. Mary will give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family.
   * Number of potted plants Mary will give away = 40 plants

4. To find the number of potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of plants she will give away from the total number of plants she has.
   * Number of potted plants Mary will remain with = 98 plants - 40 plants = 58 plants

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.
