Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary received 18 new potted plants from the plant nursery.
- She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home.
- She will give 1 potted plant from each ledge to friends and family tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary had before receiving the new 18 plants.
Number of window ledges = 40
Number of potted plants per ledge = 2
Total number of potted plants before new plants = 40 Ã— 2 = 80 plants

Step 2: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary has after receiving the new 18 plants.
Total number of potted plants after new plants = 80 + 18 = 98 plants

Step 3: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will give away to friends and family.
Number of potted plants to be given away = 40 (one from each ledge)

Step 4: Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will remain with.
