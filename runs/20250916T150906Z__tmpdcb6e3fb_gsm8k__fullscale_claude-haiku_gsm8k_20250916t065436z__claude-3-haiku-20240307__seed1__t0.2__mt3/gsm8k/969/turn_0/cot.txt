Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John needs to buy phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife.
- The price of each phone is $600.
- The price of each phone after the first 2 is half price.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first 2 phones at full price.
Cost of the first 2 phones = 2 × $600 = $1,200

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the remaining 3 phones at half price.
Cost of each phone after the first 2 = $600 / 2 = $300
Cost of the remaining 3 phones = 3 × $300 = $900

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all 5 phones.
Total cost = Cost of the first 2 phones + Cost of the remaining 3 phones
Total cost = $1,200 + $900 = $2,100

Therefore, John paid a total of $2,100 for the 5 phones.

Final answer: John paid a total of $2,100
