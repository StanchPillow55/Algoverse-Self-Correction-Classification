Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jane has saved $4 of her allowance every week for the past 8 weeks.
- She wants to save a total of $60.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Amount saved per week = $4
Number of weeks = 8
Total amount saved = $4 Ã— 8 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60.
Remaining amount to save = $60 - $32 = $28

Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take Jane to save the remaining $28.
Amount saved per week = $4
Remaining amount to save = $28
Number of additional weeks = $28 / $4 = 7 weeks

Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.

Final answer: It will take Jane 7 more weeks to save a total of $60.
