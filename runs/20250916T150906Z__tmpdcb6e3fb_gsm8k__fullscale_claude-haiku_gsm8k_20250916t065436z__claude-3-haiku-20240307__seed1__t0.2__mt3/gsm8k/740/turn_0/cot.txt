Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The class has 50 students
- 10 students like to bake
- 5 students like to play basketball
- The remaining students like to either play video games or play music
- The number of students who like to play music is twice the number who prefer playing basketball

Step 1: Find the number of students who like to play music.
Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
Number of students who like to play music = 2 Ã— 5 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of students who like to play video games.
Total number of students = 50
Number of students who like to bake = 10
Number of students who like to play basketball = 5
Number of students who like to play music = 10
Number of students who like to play video games = Total students - (students who like to bake + students who like to play basketball + students who like to play music)
Number of students who like to play video games = 50 - (10 + 5 + 10) = 25

Therefore
