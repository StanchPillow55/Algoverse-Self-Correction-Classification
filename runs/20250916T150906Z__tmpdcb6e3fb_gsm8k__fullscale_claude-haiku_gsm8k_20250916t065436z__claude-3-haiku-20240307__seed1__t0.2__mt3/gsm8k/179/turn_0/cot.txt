Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lloyd earns $10 per hour for Math tutoring.
- He tutored 5 hours in the first week.
- He tutored 8 hours in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the earnings for the first week.
Earnings for the first week = Hourly rate × Hours worked
Earnings for the first week = $10 × 5 hours = $50

Step 2: Calculate the earnings for the second week.
Earnings for the second week = Hourly rate × Hours worked
Earnings for the second week = $10 × 8 hours = $80

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings for the first two weeks.
Total earnings = Earnings for the first week + Earnings for the second week
Total earnings = $50 + $80 = $130

Therefore, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks of Math tutoring.
