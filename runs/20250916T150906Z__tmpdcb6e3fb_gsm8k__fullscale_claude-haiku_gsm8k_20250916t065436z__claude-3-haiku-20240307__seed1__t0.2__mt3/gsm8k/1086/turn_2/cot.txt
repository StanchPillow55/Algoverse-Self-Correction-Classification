Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The price of one MTB bike is $500.
- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450.
- In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
- The remaining bikes sold were MTB type.

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total bikes sold = 300

Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150 bikes
BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 45 bikes
MTB bikes sold = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling each type of bike.
Revenue from Trekking bikes = 150 bikes Ã— $450 = $67
