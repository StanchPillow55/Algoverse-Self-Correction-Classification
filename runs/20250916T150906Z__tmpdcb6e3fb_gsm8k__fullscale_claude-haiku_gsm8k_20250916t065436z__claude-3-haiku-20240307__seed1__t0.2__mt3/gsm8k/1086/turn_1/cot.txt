Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Price of one MTB bike: $500
- Price of one BMX bike: half the price of an MTB, which is $250
- Price of one Trekking bike: $450
- Total number of bikes sold in one month: 300
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes
- The remaining bikes sold were MTB type

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total bikes sold = 300
Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150
BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 45
MTB bikes sold = Total - Trekking - BMX = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from each type of bike.
Revenue from Trekking bikes = 150 × $450 = $67,500
Revenue from BMX bikes = 45 × $250 = $11,250
Revenue from
