To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold and then calculate the total revenue earned by Marcel.

Given information:
- The price of one MTB is $500.
- The price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450.
- The total number of bikes sold is 300.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total number of bikes sold = 300

Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150 bikes

Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 Ã— 300 = 45 bikes

Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
Number of MTB bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue earned by Marcel.
