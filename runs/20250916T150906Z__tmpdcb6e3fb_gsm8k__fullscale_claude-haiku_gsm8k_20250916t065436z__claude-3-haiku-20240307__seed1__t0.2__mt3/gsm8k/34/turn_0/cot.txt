Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
- Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
- Raymond has 40 jewels.

Step 1: Find how many jewels Aaron has.
Half of Raymond's jewels = 40 / 2 = 20 jewels
Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so:
Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25 jewels

Step 2: Find how many jewels Siobhan has.
Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so:
Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2
Siobhan's jewels = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.
