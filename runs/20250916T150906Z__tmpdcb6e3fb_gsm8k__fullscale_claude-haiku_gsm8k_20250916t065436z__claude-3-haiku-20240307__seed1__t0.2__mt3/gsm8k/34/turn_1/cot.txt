Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   * Let's call the number of jewels Siobhan has as "x".
   * Then, the number of jewels Aaron has is "x + 2".

2. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   * Raymond has 40 jewels.
   * Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20.
   * Aaron has 5 more than 20, so Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

3. Putting it all together:
   * Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so Siobhan has x = 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, the final answer is that Siobhan has 23 jewels.
