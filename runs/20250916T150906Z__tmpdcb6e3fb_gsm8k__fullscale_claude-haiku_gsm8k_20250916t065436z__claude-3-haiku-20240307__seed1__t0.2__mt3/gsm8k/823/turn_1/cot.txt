Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
- In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
- In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.

Step 1: Calculate Julie's score in the first game.
Sasha's score in the first game - 4 = Julie's score in the first game
14 - 4 = 10 points

Step 2: Calculate Sasha's score in the second game.
Julie's score in the first game - 6 = Sasha's score in the second game
10 - 6 = 4 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points Sasha scored during both games.
Sasha's score in the first game + Sasha's score in the second game = Total points scored by Sasha
14 + 4 = 18 points

Therefore, the total points Sasha scored during both games is 18 points.
