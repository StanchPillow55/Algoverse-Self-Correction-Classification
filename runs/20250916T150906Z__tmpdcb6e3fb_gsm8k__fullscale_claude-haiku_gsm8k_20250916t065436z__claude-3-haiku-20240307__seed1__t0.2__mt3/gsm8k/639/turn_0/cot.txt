To solve this problem, we need to find the total volume of the hole that Bob wants to dig and then calculate the time it will take him to dig the entire hole.

Given information:
- The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.
- It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the hole.
Volume of the hole = Length × Width × Depth
Volume of the hole = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume of the hole = 72 cubic feet

Step 2: Calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the entire hole.
Time to dig the hole = Volume of the hole × Time to shovel a cubic foot of earth
Time to dig the hole = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Time to dig the hole = 216 seconds

Step 3: Convert the time from seconds to minutes and seconds.
Time to dig the hole in minutes and seconds = 216 seconds
Minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute =
