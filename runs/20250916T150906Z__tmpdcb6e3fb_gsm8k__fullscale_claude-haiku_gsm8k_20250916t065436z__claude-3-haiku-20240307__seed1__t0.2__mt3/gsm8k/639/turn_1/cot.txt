Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the volume of the hole that Bob needs to dig:
   * Length: 6 feet
   * Width: 4 feet
   * Depth: 3 feet
   * Volume = Length x Width x Depth
   * Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet
   * Volume = 72 cubic feet

2. Determine how long it takes Bob to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth:
   * Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth

3. Determine how long it will take Bob to dig the entire hole:
   * Total volume of the hole: 72 cubic feet
   * Time to shovel 1 cubic foot: 3 seconds
   * Total time to dig the hole = Total volume x Time per cubic foot
   * Total time to dig the hole = 72 cubic feet x 3 seconds/cubic foot
   * Total time to dig the hole = 216 seconds

4. Convert the total time from seconds to minutes and seconds:
