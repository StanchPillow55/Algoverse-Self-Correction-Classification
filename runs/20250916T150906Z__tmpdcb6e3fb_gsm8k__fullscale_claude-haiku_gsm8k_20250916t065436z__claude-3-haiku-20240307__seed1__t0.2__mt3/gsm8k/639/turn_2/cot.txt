Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the volume of the hole:
   * Length: 6 feet
   * Width: 4 feet
   * Depth: 3 feet
   * Volume = Length x Width x Depth
   * Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 3 ft = 72 cubic feet

2. Calculate the time it takes to dig the hole:
   * It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth
   * To dig the entire hole (72 cubic feet), it will take:
   * Time = Volume x Time per cubic foot
   * Time = 72 cubic feet x 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

3. Convert the time from seconds to minutes and seconds:
   * 216 seconds = 3 minutes and 36 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 3 minutes and 36 seconds to dig the hole.
