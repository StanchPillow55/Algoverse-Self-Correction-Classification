To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike over the two different time periods.

Given information:
- For the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time.
- For the next three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in the first four weeks.
Distance per ride × Number of rides per week × Number of weeks = Total distance in the first four weeks
25 kilometers × 5 rides per week × 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in the next three weeks.
Distance per ride × Number of rides per week × Number of weeks = Total distance in the next three weeks
60 kilometers × 2 rides per week × 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in both time periods.
Total distance in the first four weeks + Total distance in the next three weeks = Total distance
