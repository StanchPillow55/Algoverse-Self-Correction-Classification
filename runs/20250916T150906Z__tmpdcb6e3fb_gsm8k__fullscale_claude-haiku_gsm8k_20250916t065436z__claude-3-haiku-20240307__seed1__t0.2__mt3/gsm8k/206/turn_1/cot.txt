Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first 4 weeks.
* Micheal rode the bike 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers.
* So, in one week, he rode 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers.
* In 4 weeks, he rode 4 x 125 = 500 kilometers.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Micheal rode in the next 3 weeks.
* Micheal rode the bike 2 times a week, and each time he rode 60 kilometers.
* So, in one week, he rode 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers.
* In 3 weeks, he rode 3 x 120 = 360 kilometers.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode.
* Total distance = Distance in first 4 weeks + Distance in next 3 weeks
* Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance
