Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The dragon's flame can reach up to 1000 feet.
- Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone.
- When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
Distance with gemstone = 3 Ã— 400 feet = 1200 feet

Step 2: Calculate the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon.
Distance outside dragon's flames = Distance with gemstone - Dragon's flame reach
Distance outside dragon's flames = 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.
