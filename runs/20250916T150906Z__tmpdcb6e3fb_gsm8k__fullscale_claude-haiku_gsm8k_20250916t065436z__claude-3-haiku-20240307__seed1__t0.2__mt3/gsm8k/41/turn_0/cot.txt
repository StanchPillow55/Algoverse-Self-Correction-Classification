To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, and then compare it to the distance of the dragon's flames to determine how far outside the reach of the flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon.

Given information:
- The dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet.
- Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
- When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the gemstone.
Distance with gemstone = Distance without gemstone × 3
Distance with gemstone = 400 feet × 3 = 1200 feet

Step 2: Calculate the distance Polly can stand outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon.
Distance outside the reach of the flames = Distance with gemstone - Distance of the flames
Distance outside the reach of the flames = 1200 feet - 1000
