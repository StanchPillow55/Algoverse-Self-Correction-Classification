Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth she lost.
- The tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth she lost.
- For each of the last 2 teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the first tooth.
Amount for the first tooth = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the next three teeth.
Amount for each of the next three teeth = $1.00
Total amount for the next three teeth = 3 × $1.00 = $3.00

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money the tooth fairy gave Sharon for the last two teeth.
Amount for each of the last two teeth = $1.00 ÷ 2 = $0.50
Total amount for the last two teeth = 2 × $0.50 = $1.00
