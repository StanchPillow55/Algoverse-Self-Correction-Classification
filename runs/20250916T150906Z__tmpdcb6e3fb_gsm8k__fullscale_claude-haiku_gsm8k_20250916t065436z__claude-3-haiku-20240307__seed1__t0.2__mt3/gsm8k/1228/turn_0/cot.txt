Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley.
- Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim.
- Samantha has 27 paintings.

Step 1: Find how many paintings Shelley has.
Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so:
Shelley's paintings = Samantha's paintings + 12
Shelley's paintings = 27 + 12 = 39 paintings

Step 2: Find how many paintings Kim has.
Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim, so:
Kim's paintings = Shelley's paintings - 8
Kim's paintings = 39 - 8 = 31 paintings

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.
