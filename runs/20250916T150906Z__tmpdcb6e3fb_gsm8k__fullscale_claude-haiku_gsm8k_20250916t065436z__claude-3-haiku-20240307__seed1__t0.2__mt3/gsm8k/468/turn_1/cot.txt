Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, which is 10 additional shoes.
   * 200 shoes + 10 shoes = 210 shoes

3. On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 30 additional shoes.
   * 210 shoes + 30 shoes = 240 shoes

4. On Friday, he gains 30 new pairs, which is 60 additional shoes.
   * 240 shoes + 60 shoes = 300 shoes

5. On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes.
   * 300 shoes - 180 shoes = 120 shoes

Therefore, on Sunday, Fireman Frank will have 120 shoes.
