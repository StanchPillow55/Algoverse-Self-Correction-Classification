Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips per week without the weekly pass.
Cost per bus trip = $2.20
Number of bus trips per day = 2
Number of days per week = 5
Total cost per week = 2 trips/day × $2.20/trip × 5 days/week = $22.00

Step 2: Calculate the savings by buying the weekly bus pass.
Cost of weekly bus pass = $20.00
Total cost without weekly pass = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without weekly pass - Cost of weekly pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass for $20.

Final answer: Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass for $20.
