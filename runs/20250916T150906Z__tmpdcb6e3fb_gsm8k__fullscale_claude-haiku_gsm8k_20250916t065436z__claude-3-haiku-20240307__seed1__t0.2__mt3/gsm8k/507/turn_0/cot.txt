To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass and then compare it to the cost of the weekly pass to determine the savings.

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass.
Number of bus trips per day = 2
Number of days per week = 5
Cost per bus trip = $2.20
Total cost per week = Number of bus trips per day × Number of days per week × Cost per bus trip
Total cost per week = 2 × 5 × $2.20 = $22.00

Step 2: Calculate the savings by buying a weekly bus pass.
Cost of weekly bus pass = $20
Total cost without weekly pass = $22.00
Savings = Total cost without weekly pass - Cost of weekly bus pass
Savings = $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass
