Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ryan's allowance is $6 per week, and he did his chores for 3 weeks.
   * Allowance for 3 weeks = $6 x 3 = $18

2. Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.
   * Total cost of ice cream = $1.25 x 4 = $5

3. Now they want to go to the movies, and the tickets cost $6.50 each.
   * Remaining money after buying ice cream = $18 - $5 = $13

4. To find how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each ticket.
   * Number of movie tickets = $13 / $6.50 = 2 tickets

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.
