Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores.
- He did his chores for 3 weeks.
- He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.
- Movie tickets cost $6.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of allowance Ryan earned.
Allowance per week × Number of weeks = Total allowance
$6 × 3 weeks = $18

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.
Cost per cone × Number of cones = Total cost of ice cream cones
$1.25 × 4 cones = $5

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money Ryan has after buying the ice cream cones.
Total allowance - Total cost of ice cream cones = Remaining amount
$18 - $5 = $13

Step 4: Calculate the number of movie tickets Ryan can buy.
Remaining amount / Cost per ticket = Number of movie tickets
$13 / $6
