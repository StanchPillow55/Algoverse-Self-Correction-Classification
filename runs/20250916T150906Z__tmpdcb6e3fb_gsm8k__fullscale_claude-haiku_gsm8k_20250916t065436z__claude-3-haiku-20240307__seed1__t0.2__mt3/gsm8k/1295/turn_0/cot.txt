Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ryan's allowance is $6 each week he completes his chores.
2. He did his chores for 3 weeks.
   * So, his total allowance earned = $6 x 3 weeks = $18

3. He then bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each.
   * Number of ice cream cones = 4 (Ryan + 3 friends)
   * Cost of each ice cream cone = $1.25
   * Total cost of ice cream cones = 4 x $1.25 = $5

4. Now they all want to go to the movies and tickets cost $6.50 each.
   * Number of movie tickets needed = 4 (Ryan + 3 friends)
   * Cost of each movie ticket = $6.50

To calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we need to subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the total allowance he earned, and then divide the remaining amount by the cost of each movie ticket.
