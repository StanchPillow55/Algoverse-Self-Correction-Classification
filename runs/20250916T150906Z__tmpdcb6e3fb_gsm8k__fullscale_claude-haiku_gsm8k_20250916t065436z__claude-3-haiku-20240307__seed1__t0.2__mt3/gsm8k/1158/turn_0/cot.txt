To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy demand covered by the current production of 4200 bottles.
2. Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.
3. Calculate the difference between the total daily energy demand and the current production coverage.
4. Calculate the number of additional bottles needed to cover the remaining energy demand.

Step 1: Calculate the daily energy demand covered by the current production of 4200 bottles.
* Each bottle of juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand.
* 4200 bottles can cover 20% of 4200 people's daily energy demand.
* 4200 bottles can cover 20% × 4200 = 840 people's daily energy demand.

Step 2: Calculate the total daily energy demand of 2300 people.
* The total daily energy demand of 2300 people is 100% of 2300 people's daily energy demand.
* Total daily energy demand = 100% × 2300 = 2300 people's daily energy demand.

Step 3: Calculate the difference
