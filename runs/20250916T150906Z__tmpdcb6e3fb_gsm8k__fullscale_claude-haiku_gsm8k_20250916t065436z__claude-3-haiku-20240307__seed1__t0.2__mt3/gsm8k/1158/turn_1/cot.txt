To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the daily energy demand of 2300 people.
2. Calculate the daily energy demand that can be satisfied by the current production of 4200 bottles.
3. Calculate the additional energy demand that needs to be satisfied.
4. Calculate the number of additional bottles needed to satisfy the additional energy demand.

Step 1: Calculate the daily energy demand of 2300 people.
Since each bottle of juice can cover 20% of 1 person's daily energy demand, we can calculate the total daily energy demand as follows:
* Total daily energy demand = 2300 people × (1 / 0.20) = 11,500 person-units of energy demand

Step 2: Calculate the daily energy demand that can be satisfied by the current production of 4200 bottles.
* Energy demand satisfied by 4200 bottles = 4200 bottles × 0.20 = 840 person-units of energy demand

Step 3: Calculate the additional energy demand that needs to be satisfied.
* Additional energy demand = 11,500 person-units - 840
