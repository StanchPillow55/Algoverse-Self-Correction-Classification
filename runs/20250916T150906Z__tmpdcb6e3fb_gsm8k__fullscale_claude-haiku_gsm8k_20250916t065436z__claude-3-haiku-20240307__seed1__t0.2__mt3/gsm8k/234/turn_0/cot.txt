To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tomatoes Steve needs per week and then calculate the number of vines required to meet his weekly demand.

Given information:
- Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve needs per week.
Steve's daily tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes
Steve's weekly tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes × 7 days = 42 tomatoes

Step 2: Calculate the number of tomatoes Steve's girlfriend needs per week.
Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend's daily tomato consumption = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 tomatoes
His girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption = 3 tomatoes × 7 days = 21 tomatoes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend need per week.
Total weekly tomato consumption = Steve's weekly tomato consumption + His girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption
Total weekly tomato consumption =
