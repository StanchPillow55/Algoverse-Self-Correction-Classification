Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 1: Calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats per week.
Steve's daily tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes
Steve's weekly tomato consumption = 6 tomatoes Ã— 7 days = 42 tomatoes

Step 2: Calculate how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per week.
Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption = 42 tomatoes / 2 = 21 tomatoes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat per week.
Total weekly tomato consumption = Steve's weekly tomato consumption + Girlfriend's weekly tomato consumption
Total weekly tomato consumption = 42 tomatoes + 21 tomatoes = 63 tomatoes

Step 4: Calculate the number of vines needed to produce the required number of tomatoes per week.
