Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
- Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
- A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

Step 1: Calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats per week.
Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
Number of days in a week = 7
Total tomatoes eaten per week = 6 tomatoes/day ร 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week

Step 2: Calculate how many tomatoes his girlfriend eats per week.
Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats half as much as him.
Girlfriend's tomatoes per week = 42 tomatoes/week รท 2 = 21 tomatoes/week

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tomatoes needed per week.
Total tomatoes needed per week = Steve's tomatoes per week + Girlfriend's tomatoes per week
Total tomatoes needed per week = 42 tomatoes/week + 21 tomatoes/
