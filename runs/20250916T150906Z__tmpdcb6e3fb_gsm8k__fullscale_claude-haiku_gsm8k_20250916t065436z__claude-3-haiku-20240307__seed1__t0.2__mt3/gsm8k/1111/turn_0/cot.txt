Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- There are 3 red balls, 11 blue balls, and 25 green balls in the store.
- Red balls cost $9 each, blue balls cost $5 each, and green balls cost $3 each.

To find the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the red, blue, and green balls.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling the red balls.

Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the green balls.
Revenue from green balls = Number of green balls × Cost of each green ball
Revenue from green balls = 25 × $3 = $75

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue by adding the
