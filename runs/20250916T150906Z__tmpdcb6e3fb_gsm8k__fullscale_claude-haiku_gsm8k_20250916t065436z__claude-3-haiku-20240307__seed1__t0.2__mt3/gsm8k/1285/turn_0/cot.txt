To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of meals Mamou distributed and then subtract it from the total number of meals she had to distribute.

Given information:
- Mamou has 1,360 meals to distribute.
- She gave out 64 meals on Friday.
- She gave out 30 meals on Saturday.
- She gave out 48 meals on Sunday.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of meals Mamou distributed.
Meals distributed on Friday = 64
Meals distributed on Saturday = 30
Meals distributed on Sunday = 48
Total meals distributed = 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals

Step 2: Calculate the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute.
Total meals to distribute = 1,360
Total meals distributed = 142
Meals left to distribute = 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.
