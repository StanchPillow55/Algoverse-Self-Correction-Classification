To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of croissants Juan wants to make and then calculate the amount of butter required.

Given information:
- It takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.
- Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of croissants Juan wants to make.
Number of croissants per day = 4 dozen
Number of days in a week = 7 days
Total number of croissants = 4 dozen × 7 days = 28 dozen

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of butter required.
Amount of butter per dozen croissants = 1/4 pound
Total amount of butter required = (28 dozen) × (1/4 pound) = 7 pounds

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 28 dozen croissants for a week.

Final answer: Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make the croissants.
