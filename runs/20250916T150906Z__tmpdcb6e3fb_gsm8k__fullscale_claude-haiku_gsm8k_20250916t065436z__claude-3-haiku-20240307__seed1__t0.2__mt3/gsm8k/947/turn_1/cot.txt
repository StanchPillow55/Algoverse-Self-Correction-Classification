Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class.
2. She then lost 7 stickers during playtime.
   * So, the number of stickers she had after losing 7 is: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers.
3. Her teacher then gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.
   * So, the total number of stickers she has at the end is: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.
