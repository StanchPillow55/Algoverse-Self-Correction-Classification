Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- The ice cream factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- We need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the rate of production for chocolate ice cream.
Rate of chocolate ice cream production = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

Step 2: Calculate the rate of production for vanilla ice cream.
Rate of vanilla ice cream production = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours.
Total chocolate ice cream = Rate of chocolate ice cream production × Time
Total chocolate ice cream = 50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2,400 quarts

Step 4: Calculate the total quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours.
Total vanilla ice cream = Rate of vanilla ice cream
