Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 150 teachers on the school basketball court.
- 60% of the teachers are history teachers.
- The remaining teachers are math teachers.
- Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers.
60% of 150 teachers = 0.60 × 150 = 90 history teachers

Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers.
Total teachers - History teachers = Math teachers
150 - 90 = 60 math teachers

Step 3: Calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.
Time spent sleeping per math teacher per day = 6 hours
Total time spent sleeping by math teachers per day = 60 math teachers × 6 hours = 360 hours

Therefore, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.
