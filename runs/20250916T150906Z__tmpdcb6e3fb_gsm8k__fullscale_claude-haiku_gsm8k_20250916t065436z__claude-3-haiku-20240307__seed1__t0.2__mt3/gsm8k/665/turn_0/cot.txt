To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of history teachers on the basketball court.
2. Calculate the number of math teachers on the basketball court.
3. Calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers on the basketball court.
* Total number of teachers on the basketball court = 150
* 60% of the teachers are history teachers
* To find the number of history teachers, we multiply the total number of teachers by 60%:
* Number of history teachers = 150 Ã— 0.60 = 90 history teachers

Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers on the basketball court.
* Total number of teachers on the basketball court = 150
* Number of history teachers = 90
* Number of math teachers = Total number of teachers - Number of history teachers
* Number of math teachers = 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers

Step 3: Calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day.
* Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day
* Total time the math teachers collectively spen
