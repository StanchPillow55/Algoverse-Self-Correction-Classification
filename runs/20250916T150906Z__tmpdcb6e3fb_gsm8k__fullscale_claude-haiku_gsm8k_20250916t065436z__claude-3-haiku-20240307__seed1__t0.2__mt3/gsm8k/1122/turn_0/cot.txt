To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of toys produced by the first four workers and then calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce to complete the order.

Given information:
- The order is for 400 toys.
- 5 workers are available to work on the order.
- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
- All workers work a 10-hour shift.
- By the end of the shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to complete the order.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first four workers.
Toys produced by the first two workers:
2 workers × 6 toys/hour × 10 hours = 120 toys

Toys produced by the other two workers:
2 workers × 4 toys/hour × 10 hours = 80 toys

Total toys produced by the first four workers:
120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys the fifth worker needs to produce.
Total toys needed for
