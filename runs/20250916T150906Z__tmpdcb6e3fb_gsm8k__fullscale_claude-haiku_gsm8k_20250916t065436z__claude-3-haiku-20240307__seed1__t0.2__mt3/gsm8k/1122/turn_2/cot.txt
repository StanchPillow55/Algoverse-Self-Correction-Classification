Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys.
- 5 workers are available to work on the order.
- 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.
- They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift.
- By the end of their shift, the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers during their 10-hour shift.
Toys produced by the first 2 workers: 2 workers × 6 toys/hour × 10 hours = 120 toys
Toys produced by the next 2 workers: 2 workers × 4 toys/hour × 10 hours = 80 toys
Total toys produced by the first 4 workers: 120 + 80 = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toys needed to fulfill the order.
Total toys needed =
