Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The order is for 400 toys.
- There are 5 workers available.
- 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour.
- 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.
- They all work a 10-hour shift.
- By the end of the shift, 20 more toys are needed to complete the order.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers.
2 workers producing 6 toys/hour each for 10 hours = 2 × 6 × 10 = 120 toys
2 workers producing 4 toys/hour each for 10 hours = 2 × 4 × 10 = 80 toys
Total toys produced by first 4 workers = 120 + 80 = 200 toys

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of toys needed to complete the order.
Total order - Toys produced by first 4 workers = 400 - 200 = 200 toys
