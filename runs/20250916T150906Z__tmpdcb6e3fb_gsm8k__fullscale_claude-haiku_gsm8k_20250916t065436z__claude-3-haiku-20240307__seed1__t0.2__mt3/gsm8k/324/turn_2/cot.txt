Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1) We know that 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records between them.
2) The problem states that people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.
3) So, if the 5 people left with 7 new records, that means they traded in a certain number of old records to get those 7 new records.
4) We can set up an equation to solve for the number of old records:
   * Let x = the number of old records the 5 people brought in
   * Since they traded 2 old records for 1 new record, the number of new records they got is x/2
   * The problem states they left with 7 new records, so we can write the equation:
     x/2 = 7
   * Solving for x, we get:
     x = 14
5) Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.

Final answer: The 5 people brought in 14 old records.
