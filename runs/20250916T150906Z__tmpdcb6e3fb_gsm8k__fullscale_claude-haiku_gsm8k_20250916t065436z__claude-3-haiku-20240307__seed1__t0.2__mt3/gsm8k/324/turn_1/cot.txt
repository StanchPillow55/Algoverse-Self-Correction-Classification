Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- People can trade 2 old records for 1 new one.
- 5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.

To find the number of old records the 5 people brought in, we need to work backwards from the number of new records they received.

Step 1: Determine the number of new records each person received.
Total new records received = 7
Number of people = 5
New records per person = 7 / 5 = 1.4 (rounded down to 1 new record per person)

Step 2: Determine the number of old records each person traded in.
Old records per person = 2 (since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of old records brought in by the 5 people.
Total old records = Old records per person × Number of people
Total old records = 2 × 5 = 10

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 10
