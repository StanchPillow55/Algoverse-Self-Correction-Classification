To solve this problem, we need to find the number of old records that the 5 people brought in.

Given information:
- People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
- 5 people came in with old records and left with 7 new records between them.

Step 1: Determine the relationship between the number of old records and the number of new records.
Since people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record, the number of new records is half the number of old records.

Let's represent the number of old records as x.
Then, the number of new records is x/2.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the given information.
We know that the 5 people left with a total of 7 new records, so we can write the equation:
x/2 = 7

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
x/2 = 7
x = 2 Ã— 7
x = 14

Therefore, the 5 people brought in a total of 14 old records.

Final answer: The 5 people brought
