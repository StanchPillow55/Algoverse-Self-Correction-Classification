Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jen works 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.
- She receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance.
- There are exactly 4 weeks in April, and Jen did not incur any absences.

Step 1: Calculate Jen's weekly earnings.
Hours worked per week = 7.5 hours/day × 6 days/week = 45 hours/week
Weekly earnings = 45 hours/week × $1.5/hour = $67.5/week

Step 2: Calculate Jen's earnings for the month of April.
Weeks in April = 4 weeks
Earnings for April = $67.5/week × 4 weeks = $270

Step 3: Calculate the additional $10 for complete attendance.
Since Jen did not incur any absences, she will receive the additional $10.

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Jen will receive.
Total amount = Earnings for April
