To solve this problem, we need to calculate Jen's total earnings for the month of April, considering her hourly rate, the number of hours she works per week, and the additional attendance bonus.

Given information:
- Jen works for 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week.
- Jen's hourly rate is $1.5.
- Jen receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance.
- There are exactly 4 weeks in April.
- Jen did not incur any absences for April.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Jen worked in April.
Hours worked per day = 7.5 hours
Days worked per week = 6 days
Weeks in April = 4 weeks
Total hours worked in April = 7.5 hours × 6 days × 4 weeks = 180 hours

Step 2: Calculate Jen's earnings based on her hourly rate.
Earnings based on hourly rate = 180 hours × $1.5 per hour = $270

Step 3: Calculate the additional attendance bonus.
