Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jen works for 7.5 hours a day, 6 days a week.
- Her hourly rate is $1.5.
- Jen receives an additional $10 if she has complete attendance.
- There are exactly 4 weeks in April, and Jen did not incur any absences.

Step 1: Calculate Jen's weekly earnings.
Jen's daily earnings = 7.5 hours × $1.5 per hour = $11.25
Jen's weekly earnings = 6 days × $11.25 per day = $67.50
