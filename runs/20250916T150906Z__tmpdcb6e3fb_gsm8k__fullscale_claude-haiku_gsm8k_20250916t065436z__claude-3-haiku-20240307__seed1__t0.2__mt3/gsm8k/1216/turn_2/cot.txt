Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The bus has a capacity of 200 people.
- When the bus departed Chengli city, it had 20 people.
- On the first stop, 40 people entered the bus.
- On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus.
- The number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the first stop.
Number of people on the bus after the first stop = 20 + 40 = 60 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the second station.
Number of people who entered the bus at the second station = 3/4 Ã— 40 = 30 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the second station.
Number of people on the bus after the second station = 60 + 30 = 90 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the third station.
