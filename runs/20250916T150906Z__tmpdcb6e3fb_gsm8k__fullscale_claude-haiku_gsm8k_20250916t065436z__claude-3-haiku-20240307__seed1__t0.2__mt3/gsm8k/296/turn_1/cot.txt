Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice for every lunch and dinner.

To find how many weeks the 42 kg bag of rice will last, we need to calculate the total rice consumption per day and then divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption.

Step 1: Calculate the total rice consumption per day.
Rice consumption per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Number of people = 5
Total rice consumption per day = 0.2 kg × 2 meals × 5 people = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total amount of rice = 42 kg
Daily rice consumption = 2 kg
Number of days the rice will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the 42
