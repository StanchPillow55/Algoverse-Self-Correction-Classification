To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of rice consumed by the household per day and then calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.

Given information:
- Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice every lunch and dinner.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Rice consumed per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Number of people = 5
Total rice consumed per day = 0.2 kg × 2 meals × 5 people = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total rice in the bag = 42 kg
Rice consumed per day = 2 kg
Number of days the bag will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Convert the number of days to weeks.
Number of days = 21 days
Number of weeks = 21
