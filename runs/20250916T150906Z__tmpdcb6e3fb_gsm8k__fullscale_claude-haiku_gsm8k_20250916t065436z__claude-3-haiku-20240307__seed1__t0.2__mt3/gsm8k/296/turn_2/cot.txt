Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each person in the household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal.
- There are 5 members in the household who eat rice for lunch and dinner.
- The household has a 42 kg bag of rice.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice consumed per day.
Rice consumed per person per meal = 0.2 kg
Number of meals per day = 2 (lunch and dinner)
Total rice consumed per person per day = 0.2 kg × 2 = 0.4 kg
Total rice consumed by 5 people per day = 0.4 kg × 5 = 2 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.
Total rice in the bag = 42 kg
Rice consumed per day = 2 kg
Number of days the rice will last = 42 kg ÷ 2 kg per day = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks the 42 kg bag of rice
