To solve this problem, we need to find the depreciation of the car over the given time period and then subtract it from the original price to find the price of the car in 2010.

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010.
The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

Depreciation from 2007 to 2008 = 21% of $20,000 = $4,200
Depreciation from 2008 to 2009 = 21% of ($20,000 - $4,200) = $3,318
Depreciation from 2009 to 2010 = 21% of ($20,000 - $4,200 - $3,318) = $2,621

Total depreciation from 2007 to 2010
