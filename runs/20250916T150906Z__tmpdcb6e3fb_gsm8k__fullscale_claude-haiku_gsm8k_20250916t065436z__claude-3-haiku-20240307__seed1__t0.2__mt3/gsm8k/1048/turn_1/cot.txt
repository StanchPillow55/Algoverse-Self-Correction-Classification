Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the price of the car in 2008.
Price in 2008 = Price in 2007 × (1 - Depreciation rate)
Price in 2008 = $20,000 × (1 - 0.21)
Price in 2008 = $20,000 × 0.79
Price in 2008 = $15,800

Step 2: Calculate the price of the car in 2009.
Price in 2009 = Price in 2008 × (1 - Depreciation rate)
Price in 2009 = $15,800 × (1 - 0.21)
Price in 2009 = $15,800 × 0.79
Price in 2009 = $
