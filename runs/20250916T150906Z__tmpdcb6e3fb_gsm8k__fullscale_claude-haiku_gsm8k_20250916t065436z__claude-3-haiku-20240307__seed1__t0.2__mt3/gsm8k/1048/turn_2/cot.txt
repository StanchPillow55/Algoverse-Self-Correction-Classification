Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Ben bought a car for $20,000 in 2007.
- The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
- We need to find the price of the car in the year 2010.

Step 1: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2008.
Depreciation rate = 21% per year
Depreciation in 2008 = $20,000 × 0.21 = $4,200
Price of the car in 2008 = $20,000 - $4,200 = $15,800

Step 2: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2008 to 2009.
Depreciation in 2009 = $15,800 × 0.21 = $3,318
Price of the car in 2009 = $15,800 - $3,318 = $12,482

Step 3: Calculate the depreciation of the car from 2009 to 2010
