Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, there were 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. Mara added 3 more slices, so now there are 2 + 3 = 5 slices on the plate.
3. Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently has, which is 5. So, 5 x 3 = 15 slices on the plate.
4. Mara then ate 2 slices, so now there are 15 - 2 = 13 slices on the plate.
5. Mara's friend then stole 5 slices, so now there are 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate.

Therefore, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.
