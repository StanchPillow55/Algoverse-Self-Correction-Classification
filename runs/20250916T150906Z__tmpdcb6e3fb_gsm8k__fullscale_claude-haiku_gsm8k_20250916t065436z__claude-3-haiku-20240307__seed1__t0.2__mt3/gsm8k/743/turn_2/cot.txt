Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mara started with 2 slices of cake on the plate.
2. She added 3 more slices, so now there are 2 + 3 = 5 slices on the plate.
3. She then tripled the number of slices she currently has, which is 5 x 3 = 15 slices.
4. She ate 2 slices, so now there are 15 - 2 = 13 slices on the plate.
5. Her friend then stole 5 slices, so now there are 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate.

Therefore, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.
