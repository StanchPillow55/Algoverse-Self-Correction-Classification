To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of employees that can be accommodated on the day trip.

Given information:
- 4 buses with a capacity of 60 employees each
- 6 minibusses with a capacity of 30 employees each
- 10 minivans with a capacity of 15 employees each

Step 1: Calculate the total capacity of the buses.
Capacity of buses = 4 buses × 60 employees per bus = 240 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of the minibusses.
Capacity of minibusses = 6 minibusses × 30 employees per minibus = 180 employees

Step 3: Calculate the total capacity of the minivans.
Capacity of minivans = 10 minivans × 15 employees per minivan = 150 employees

Step 4: Calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles.
Total capacity = Capacity of buses + Capacity of minibusses + Capacity of minivans
Total capacity = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570
