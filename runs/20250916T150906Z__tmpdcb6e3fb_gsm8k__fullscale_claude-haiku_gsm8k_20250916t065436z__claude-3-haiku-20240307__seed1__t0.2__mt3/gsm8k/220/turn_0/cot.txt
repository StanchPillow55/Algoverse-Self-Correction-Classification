Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes Carmen 10 minutes to finish a crossword puzzle.
- It takes Carmen 5 minutes to finish a sudoku puzzle.
- Over the weekend, Carmen solved 3 crossword puzzles and 8 sudoku puzzles.

To find the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we need to calculate the time spent on the crossword puzzles and the time spent on the sudoku puzzles, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on the crossword puzzles.
Time per crossword puzzle × Number of crossword puzzles = Total time spent on crossword puzzles
10 minutes × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on the sudoku puzzles.
Time per sudoku puzzle × Number of sudoku puzzles = Total time spent on sudoku puzzles
5 minutes × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent playing the games.
Total time spent on crossword puzzles + Total time spent on sudoku puzzles = Total time
