Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Time to finish one crossword puzzle: 10 minutes
2. Time to finish one sudoku puzzle: 5 minutes
3. Number of crossword puzzles solved: 3
4. Number of sudoku puzzles solved: 8

To calculate the total time spent playing these games, we need to find the time spent on the crossword puzzles and the time spent on the sudoku puzzles, then add them together.

Time spent on crossword puzzles:
* 3 crossword puzzles x 10 minutes per puzzle = 30 minutes

Time spent on sudoku puzzles:
* 8 sudoku puzzles x 5 minutes per puzzle = 40 minutes

Total time spent playing:
* 30 minutes (crossword puzzles) + 40 minutes (sudoku puzzles) = 70 minutes

Therefore, the total time Carmen spent playing these games over the weekend is 70 minutes.
