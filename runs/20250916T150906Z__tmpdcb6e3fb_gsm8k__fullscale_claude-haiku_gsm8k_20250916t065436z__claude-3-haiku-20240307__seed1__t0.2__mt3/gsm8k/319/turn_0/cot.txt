To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of electric poles and the number of electric wires, and then use the given information to calculate the total number of electric poles required.

Given information:
- The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3.
- The total number of electric wires needed is 45.

Step 1: Understand the ratio of electric poles to electric wires.
The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3, which means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of electric poles and the number of electric wires.
Let the number of electric poles be x.
Then, the number of electric wires will be 3x, as per the given ratio.

Step 3: Use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of electric poles.
Total number of electric wires = 45
3x = 45
x = 45 / 3
x = 15

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply
