Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
2. Kyle took 5 of them.
   * So, Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 x 5 = 10 fries.
   * So, Griffin now has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

4. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.

5. Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.
   * So, Griffin now has (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x fries.
