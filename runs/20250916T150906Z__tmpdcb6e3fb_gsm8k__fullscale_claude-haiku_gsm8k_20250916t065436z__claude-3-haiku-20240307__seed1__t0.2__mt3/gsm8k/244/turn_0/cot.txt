Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Griffin had 24 french fries initially.
- Kyle took 5 of Griffin's fries.
- Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.
- Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries.
- Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.
- In the end, Griffin had 27 fries.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fries that Billy took.
Kyle took 5 fries, so Billy took twice as many, which is 2 Ã— 5 = 10 fries.

Step 2: Calculate the number of fries that Colby took.
Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fries taken from Griffin.
Fries taken by Kyle: 5
Fries taken by Billy: 10
Fries taken by Colby: 2
Total fries taken
