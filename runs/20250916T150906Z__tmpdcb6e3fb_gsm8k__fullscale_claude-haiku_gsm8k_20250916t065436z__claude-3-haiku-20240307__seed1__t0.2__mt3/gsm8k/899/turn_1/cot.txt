Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.
2. She was going to divide them equally between her 6 nephews.
3. Before she could package them, her husband took 4 cookies for himself.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to:
1. Subtract the 4 cookies that the husband took from the total 100 cookies.
2. Divide the remaining cookies equally among the 6 nephews.

Step 1: Subtract the 4 cookies taken by the husband.
100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies remaining

Step 2: Divide the 96 cookies equally among the 6 nephews.
96 cookies รท 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Therefore, each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

Final answer: Each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.
