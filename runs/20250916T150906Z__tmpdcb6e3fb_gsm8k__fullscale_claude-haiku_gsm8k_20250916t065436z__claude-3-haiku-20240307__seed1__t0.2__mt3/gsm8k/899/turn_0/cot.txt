Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.
- Susan was going to divide the cookies equally between her 6 nephews.
- Before Susan could package the cookies, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself.

Step 1: Determine the number of cookies left after the husband took 4 cookies.
Total cookies made = 100
Cookies taken by the husband = 4
Cookies left = 100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies equally among the 6 nephews.
Cookies left = 96
Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = 96 รท 6 = 16 cookies

Therefore, each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

Final answer: Each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.
