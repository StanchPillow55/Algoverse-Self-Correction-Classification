To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of dumplings that Larry cooked.

Given information:
- There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- There were no leftovers.

Step 1: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the females.
Number of females × Number of dumplings per female = Total dumplings eaten by females
6 × 3 = 18 dumplings

Step 2: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the males.
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can calculate the number of dumplings per male as:
Number of dumplings per male = Number of dumplings per female + 1
Number of dumplings per male = 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings

Now, we can calculate the total dumplings eaten by the males:
Number of males × Number of dumplings per male = Total dumplings eaten by males
8
