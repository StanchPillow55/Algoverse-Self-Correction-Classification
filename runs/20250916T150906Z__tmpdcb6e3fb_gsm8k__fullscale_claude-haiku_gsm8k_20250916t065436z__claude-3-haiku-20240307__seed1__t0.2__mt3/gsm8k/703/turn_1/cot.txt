Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
3. Each female ate 3 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females.

For the females:
* 6 females x 3 dumplings each = 18 dumplings

For the males:
* Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so 4 dumplings each.
* 8 males x 4 dumplings each = 32 dumplings

Total dumplings cooked:
* 18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings for the group of friends, and there were no leftovers.
