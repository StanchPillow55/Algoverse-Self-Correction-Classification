Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Base price of the truck: $30,000
- King cab upgrade: $7,500
- Leather seats: One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
- Running boards: $500 less than the leather seats
- Upgraded exterior light package: $1,500

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the leather seats.
Cost of leather seats = One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade
Cost of leather seats = $7,500 / 3 = $2,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the running boards.
Cost of running boards = Cost of leather seats - $500
Cost of running boards = $2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the truck.
Total cost = Base price + King cab upgrade + Leather seats + Running boards + Upgraded exterior light package
Total cost = $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500

Therefore,
