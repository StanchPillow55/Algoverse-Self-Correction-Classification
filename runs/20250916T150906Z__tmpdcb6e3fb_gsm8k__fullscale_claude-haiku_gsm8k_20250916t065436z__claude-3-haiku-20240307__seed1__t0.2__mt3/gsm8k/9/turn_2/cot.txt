Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.
- Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
- Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

To calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week, we need to find the amount she earned for her regular hours and the amount she earned for her overtime hours, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Eliza earned for her regular hours.
Regular hours = 40 hours
Regular hourly rate = $10
Amount earned for regular hours = 40 hours × $10 per hour = $400

Step 2: Calculate the amount Eliza earned for her overtime hours.
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime hourly rate = 1.2 × $10 per hour = $12 per hour
Amount earned for overtime hours = 5 hours × $12 per hour = $60
