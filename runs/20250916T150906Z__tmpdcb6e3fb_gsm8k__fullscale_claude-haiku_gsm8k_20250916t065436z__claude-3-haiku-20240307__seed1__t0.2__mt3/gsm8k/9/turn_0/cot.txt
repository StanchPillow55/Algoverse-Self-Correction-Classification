To solve this problem, we need to calculate Eliza's earnings for the regular hours and the overtime hours, then add them together to find her total earnings for the week.

Given information:
- Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
- Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
- Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

Step 1: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the regular hours.
Regular hours = 40 hours
Regular earnings = Regular hourly rate × Regular hours
Regular earnings = $10 × 40 hours = $400

Step 2: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the overtime hours.
Overtime hours = Total hours - Regular hours
Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours
Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly rate × 1.2
Overtime pay rate = $10 × 1.2 = $12 per hour
Overtime earnings = Overtime pay rate × Overtime hours
Overtime earnings = $12 × 5 hours = $60

Step 3: Calculate
