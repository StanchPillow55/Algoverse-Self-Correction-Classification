Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John has 20 minutes of math homework
- John has 40 minutes of reading homework
- John has 20 minutes of history homework
- John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner

Step 1: Calculate the total time for John's homework.
Math homework: 20 minutes
Reading homework: 40 minutes
History homework: 20 minutes
Total homework time = 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes

Step 2: Convert the time before dinner from hours to minutes.
3 hours = 3 Ã— 60 minutes = 180 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time John has available for napping.
Time available for napping = Time before dinner - Total homework time
Time available for napping = 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.

Final answer: John has 100 minutes to nap.
