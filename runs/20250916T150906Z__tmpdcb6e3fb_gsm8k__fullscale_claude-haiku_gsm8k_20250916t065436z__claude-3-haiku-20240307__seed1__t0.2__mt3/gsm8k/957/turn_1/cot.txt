Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
- Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya.
- Aliya is 3 years old.

Step 1: Find Shawna's age.
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.
Aliya is 3 years old.
Therefore, Shawna's age = 3 × 3 = 9 years old.

Step 2: Find Shawna's father's age.
Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
Shawna is 9 years old.
Therefore, Shawna's father's age = 5 × 9 = 45 years old.

Final answer:
Shawna's father is 45 years old.
