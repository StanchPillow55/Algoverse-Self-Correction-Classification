Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system.
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of spaces in the shelving system.
Number of rows × Number of columns = Total number of spaces
6 × 6 = 36 spaces

Step 2: Calculate double the number of books.
Double the number of books = 2 × 36 = 72 books

Step 3: Add 20 more books to the double the number of books.
72 books + 20 = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

Final answer: Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.
