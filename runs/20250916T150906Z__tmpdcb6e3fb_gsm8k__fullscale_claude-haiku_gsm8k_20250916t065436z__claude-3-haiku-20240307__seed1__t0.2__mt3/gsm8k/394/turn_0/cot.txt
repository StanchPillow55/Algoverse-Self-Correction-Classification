Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system.
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.

Step 1: Determine the total number of spaces in the shelving system.
Total number of spaces = Number of rows × Number of columns
Total number of spaces = 6 × 6 = 36 spaces

Step 2: Calculate the number of books that is double the number of spaces.
Double the number of spaces = 2 × 36 = 72 books

Step 3: Add 20 more books to the double of the number of spaces.
Number of books needed = Double the number of spaces + 20
Number of books needed = 72 + 20 = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

Final answer: Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.
