Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books.
   * Let's call the number of books "x".
   * Wendy wants to place 2x + 20 books.

2. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   * This means the shelving system can hold 6 x 6 = 36 books.

3. Wendy wants to fill the shelving system completely.
   * So, the number of books she needs to carry is 2x + 20 = 36.

4. Solving for x:
   * 2x + 20 = 36
   * 2x = 16
   * x = 8

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 8 books to complete her task.

Final answer: Wendy needs to carry 8 books to complete her task.
