Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The rink has 12 red cars.
2. They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars. 
   * So, the number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10 cars.
3. They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
   * So, the number of blue cars = 3 x 10 = 30 cars.
4. The total number of cars in the rink is 75.
5. To find the number of yellow cars, we need to add up the number of red, green, and blue cars, then subtract that from the total number of cars.
   * Red cars: 12
   * Green cars: 10
   * Blue cars: 30
   * Total of red, green, and blue cars: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
   * Number of yellow cars = Total cars - (red + green + blue)
   * Number of yellow cars = 75 - 52 = 23

Therefore,
