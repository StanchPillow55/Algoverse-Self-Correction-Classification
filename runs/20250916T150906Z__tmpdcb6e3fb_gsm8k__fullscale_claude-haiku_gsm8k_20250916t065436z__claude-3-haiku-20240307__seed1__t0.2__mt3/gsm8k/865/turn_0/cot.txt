Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The rink has 12 red cars.
- The rink has 2 fewer green cars than red cars.
- The rink has 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.
- The rink has a total of 75 cars.

Step 1: Find the number of green cars.
Number of green cars = Number of red cars - 2
Number of green cars = 12 - 2 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of blue cars.
Number of blue cars = 3 × Number of green cars
Number of blue cars = 3 × 10 = 30

Step 3: Find the total number of cars that are not yellow.
Total number of non-yellow cars = Number of red cars + Number of green cars + Number of blue cars
Total number of non-yellow cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52

Step 4: Find the number of yellow cars.
Total number of cars = 75
Number of yellow cars = Total number of cars -
