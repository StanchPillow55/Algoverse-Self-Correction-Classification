Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Erica made 20 Valentine's cards.
2. Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made cards, with 15 cards in each box.
   * 2 boxes x 15 cards per box = 30 pre-made cards
3. She passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
4. She passed out 5 cards to her family.
   * Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards
5. She received 17 cards from family and friends.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Erica has:
* Cards made by Erica: 20
* Pre-made cards from her dad: 30
* Cards received from family and friends: 17
* Total cards: 20 + 30 + 17 = 67 cards

Therefore, Erica now has 67 Valentine's Day cards.
