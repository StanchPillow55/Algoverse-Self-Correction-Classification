Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = Colin's current age
- Let y = Wendy's current age

Step 1: Express Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age.
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
Wendy's age = 5 Ã— (x + 7)

Step 2: Express Colin's age in 25 years in terms of Wendy's current age.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
Colin's age in 25 years = y/3

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for Colin's current age.
Colin's age in 25 years = x + 25
y/3 = x + 25

Step 4: Substitute Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age
