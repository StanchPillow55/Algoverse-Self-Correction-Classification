To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for Colin's current age.

Given information:
- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be Colin's current age.
- Let y be Wendy's current age.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the first given information.
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
Wendy's age = 5 × (Colin's age in 7 years)
y = 5 × (x + 7)

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the second given information.
In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.
Colin's age in 25 years = 1/3 × Wendy's current age
x + 25 = 1/3 × y

Step 3: Solve the system of equations.
