Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jon's times:
  - Swim: 40 minutes
  - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes)
  - Run: 50 minutes
- James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon
- James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon
- Jon won by 10 minutes

Step 1: Calculate James' swim time.
Jon's swim time = 40 minutes
James' swim time = 40 minutes - (40 minutes × 10%) = 36 minutes

Step 2: Calculate James' bike time.
Jon's bike time = 80 minutes
James' bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time for Jon and James.
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes
James' total time = 36 minutes + 85 minutes + (unknown run time) = 121 minutes + (unknown run time)
