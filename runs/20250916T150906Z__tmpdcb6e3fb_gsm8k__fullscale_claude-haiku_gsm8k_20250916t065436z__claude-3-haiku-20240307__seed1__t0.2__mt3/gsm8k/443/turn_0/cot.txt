To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took James to complete the triathlon and then calculate the time it took him to run.

Given information:
- Jon's times:
  - Swim: 40 minutes
  - Bike: 1 hour and 20 minutes (80 minutes)
  - Run: 50 minutes
- James' times:
  - Swim: 10% faster than Jon
  - Bike: 5 minutes longer than Jon
  - Run: Unknown
- Jon won by 10 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate James' time for the swim.
Jon's swim time = 40 minutes
James' swim time = 40 minutes - (40 minutes Ã— 10%) = 36 minutes

Step 2: Calculate James' time for the bike.
Jon's bike time = 80 minutes
James' bike time = 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time for Jon and James.
Jon's total time = 40 minutes + 80 minutes + 50 minutes = 170 minutes
