Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cheese used for sandwiches:
   * Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, which is 7 days.
   * He used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
   * So, the total cheese used for sandwiches is:
     * 7 days x 2 slices per sandwich = 14 slices of cheese

2. Cheese used for omelets:
   * Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week.
   * He used one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich, which is 3 slices.

     * 3 days x 3 slices per omelet = 9 slices of cheese

3. Cheese used for macaroni and cheese:
   * Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that lasted him several dinners for the week.
