Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.
- He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week, using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich.
- He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week, and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

Step 1: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the sandwiches.
Number of sandwiches in a week = 7 (one per day)
Slices of cheese per sandwich = 2
Total slices of cheese for sandwiches = 7 Ã— 2 = 14 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices of cheese used for the omelets.
Number of omelets in a week = 3 (3 days)
Slices of cheese per omelet = 2 + 1 = 3 (one more than per sandwich)
Total slices of cheese for
