Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year.
- For the second year, the company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year.

Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on advertising in the second year.
Amount spent in the second year = 1/3 Ã— $15,000 = $5,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years.
Total amount spent = Amount spent in the first year + Amount spent in the second year
Total amount spent = $15,000 + $5,000 = $20,000

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is $20,000.
