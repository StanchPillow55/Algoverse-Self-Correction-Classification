To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of books that can be stored on each bookcase and then calculate the number of bookcases required to hold all 110 books.

Given information:
- Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books.
- The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf.
- The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.
- Elly has 110 books.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books that can be stored on each bookcase.
Middle shelves: 2 × 10 = 20 books
Bottom shelf: 2 × 10 = 20 books
Top shelf: 20 - 5 = 15 books
Total books per bookcase: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books

Step 2: Calculate the number of bookcases required to hold all 110 books.
Number of bookcases required = Total books / Books per bookcase
Number of bookcases required = 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases
