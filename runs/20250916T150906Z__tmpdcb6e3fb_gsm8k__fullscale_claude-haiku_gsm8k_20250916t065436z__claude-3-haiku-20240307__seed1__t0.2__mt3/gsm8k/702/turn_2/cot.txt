Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
- Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
- When all three trucks (Gissela, Gordy, and Gary) are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Step 1: Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 5,000 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.
Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks = 4,000 pounds + 5,000 pounds = 9,000 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the remaining capacity needed to reach the total of 11,600 pounds.
Remaining capacity needed = 11,600 pounds -
