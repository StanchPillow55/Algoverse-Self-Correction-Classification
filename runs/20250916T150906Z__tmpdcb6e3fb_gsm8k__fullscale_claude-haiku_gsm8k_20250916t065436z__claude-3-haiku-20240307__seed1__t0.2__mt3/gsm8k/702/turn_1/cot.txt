Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
2. Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds of gravel.
3. When all three trucks are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

To find how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we need to subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity of all three trucks.

Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:
* Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
* Gordy's truck: 4,800 pounds
* Total: 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds

Total capacity of all three trucks: 11,600 pounds

To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from
