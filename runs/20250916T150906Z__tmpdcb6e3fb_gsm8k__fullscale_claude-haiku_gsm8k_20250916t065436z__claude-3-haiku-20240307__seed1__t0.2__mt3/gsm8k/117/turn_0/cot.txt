Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children.
- The cost of each pair of shoes is $60.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes John bought.
Number of children × Number of pairs of shoes per child = Total number of pairs of shoes
3 children × 2 pairs of shoes per child = 6 pairs of shoes

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shoes.
Total number of pairs of shoes × Cost per pair = Total cost
6 pairs of shoes × $60 per pair = $360

Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360.

Final answer: John paid $360 for the shoes.
