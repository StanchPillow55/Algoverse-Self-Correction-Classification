Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Amalia's chore was to mow the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan's chore was to walk the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia's chore.
- Dior's chore was to do laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia's chore.
