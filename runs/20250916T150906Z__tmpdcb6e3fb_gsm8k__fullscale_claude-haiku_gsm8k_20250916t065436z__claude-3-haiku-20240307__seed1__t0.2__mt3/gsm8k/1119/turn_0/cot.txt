To solve this problem, we need to find the time taken by each person to complete their respective chores and then add them together to get the total time.

Given information:
- Amalia's chore: Mowing the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
- Megan's chore: Walking the dog, which took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
- Dior's chore: Doing laundry, which took her well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn.

Step 1: Calculate the time taken by Megan to walk the dog.
Megan's time = Amalia's time + 2 hours
Megan's time = 4 hours + 2 hours = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time taken by Dior to do the laundry.
Dior's time = Amalia's time + 4 hours (well over 4 hours longer)
Dior's time = 4 hours + 4 hours = 8 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time taken
