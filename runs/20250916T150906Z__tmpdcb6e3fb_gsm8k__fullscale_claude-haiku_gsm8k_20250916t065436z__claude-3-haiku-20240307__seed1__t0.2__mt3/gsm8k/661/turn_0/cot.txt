Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
- The more expensive brand of coffee costs 20% more than the normal brand.
- Roger needs a week's worth of coffee, which is 7 pounds.
- Roger also buys a donut for $2.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand of coffee.
Cost of the normal brand of coffee = $5 per pound
Cost of the more expensive brand of coffee = $5 + (20% of $5) = $5 + $1 = $6 per pound

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the coffee.
Total cost of the coffee = Cost of the more expensive brand of coffee × Number of pounds of coffee
Total cost of the coffee = $6 × 7 pounds = $42

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the purchase.
Total cost = Total cost of the coffee + Cost of the donut
Total cost = $42 + $2 = $44

Therefore, the total cost of everything that Roger bought is $44.
