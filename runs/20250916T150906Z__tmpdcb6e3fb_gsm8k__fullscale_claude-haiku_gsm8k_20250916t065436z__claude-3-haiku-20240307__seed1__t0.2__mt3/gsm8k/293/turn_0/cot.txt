Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds.
Tony's points = 2 × Mike's points
Tony's points = 2 × 21 = 42 points

Step 3: Determine which players have over 20 points and will receive an extra point in the fourth round.
Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he will receive an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, which is less than 20, so he will not receive an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he will receive
