Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds.
Tony's points = 2 × Mike's points
Tony's points = 2 × 21 = 42 points

Step 3: Determine which players get the extra point in the fourth round.
Players with over 20 points after 3 rounds get an extra point.
Mike has 21 points, so he gets an extra point.
Tony has 42 points, so he gets an extra point.
Jim has 18 points, so he does not get an extra point.

Step 4:
