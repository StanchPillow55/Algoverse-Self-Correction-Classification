Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 x 21 = 42 points.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Determine which players get the extra point.
- Mike has 21 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.
- Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.
- Tony has 42 points, which is over 20 points, so he gets an extra point.

Step 2: Calculate the total points for each player after the extra points are distributed.
- Mike's total points = 21 + 1 = 22 points
- Jim's total points = 18 + 0 = 18
