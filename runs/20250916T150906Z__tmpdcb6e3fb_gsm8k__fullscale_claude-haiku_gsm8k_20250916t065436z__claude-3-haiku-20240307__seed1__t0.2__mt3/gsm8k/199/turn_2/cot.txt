Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Determine the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences (1000) by 2 to get the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher A.
Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
Amount earned from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents

Step 3: Calculate the amount Mark earns from Publisher B.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
Amount earned from Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents/sentence = 10 cents/sentence
