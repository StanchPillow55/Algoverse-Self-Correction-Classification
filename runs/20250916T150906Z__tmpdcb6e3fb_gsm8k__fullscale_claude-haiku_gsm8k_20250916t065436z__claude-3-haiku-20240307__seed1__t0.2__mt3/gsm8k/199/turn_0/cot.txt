Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2 to find the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 ÷ 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Find the rate per sentence that Publisher B pays Mark.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
Rate per sentence for Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A.
Total amount from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents per sentence = 2,500 cents

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher B.
