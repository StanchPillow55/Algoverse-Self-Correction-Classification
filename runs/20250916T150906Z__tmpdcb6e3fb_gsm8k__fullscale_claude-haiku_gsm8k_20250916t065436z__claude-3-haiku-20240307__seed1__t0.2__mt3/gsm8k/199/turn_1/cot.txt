Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for two different publishers, Publisher A and Publisher B.
- Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays.
- Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
- Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

Step 1: Find the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher.
Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, we can divide the total number of sentences (1000) by 2 to find the number of sentences for each publisher.
Number of sentences for each publisher = 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences

Step 2: Find the rate Publisher B pays Mark per sentence.
Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, which is 5 cents per sentence.
Rate paid by Publisher B = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A.
Amount from Publisher A = 500 sentences × 5 cents per sentence = 2500 cents
