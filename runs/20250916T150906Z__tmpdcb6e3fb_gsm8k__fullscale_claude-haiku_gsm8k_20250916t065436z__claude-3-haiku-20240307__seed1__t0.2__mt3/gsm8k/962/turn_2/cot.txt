Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jen needs to pay $400 for the supplies he needs in total.
- The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.

To find the total cost of travel, we need to first find the cost of the supplies, and then calculate the cost of the travel tickets.

Step 1: Find the cost of the supplies.
Cost of supplies = $400

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the travel tickets.
The travel tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.
50% of $400 = $200
Cost of travel tickets = $400 + $200 = $600

Step 3: Find the total cost of travel.
Total cost of travel = Cost of travel tickets
Total cost of travel = $600

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.
