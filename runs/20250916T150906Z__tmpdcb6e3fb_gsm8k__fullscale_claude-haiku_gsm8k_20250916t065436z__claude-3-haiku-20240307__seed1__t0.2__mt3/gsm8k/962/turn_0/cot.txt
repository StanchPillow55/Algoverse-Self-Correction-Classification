To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the travel tickets.

Given information:
- Jen needs to pay $400 for the supplies.
- The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the travel tickets.
Cost of travel tickets = Cost of supplies + 50% of the cost of supplies
Cost of travel tickets = $400 + (0.5 Ã— $400)
Cost of travel tickets = $400 + $200
Cost of travel tickets = $600

Therefore, the travel cost is $600.

Final answer: The travel cost is $600.
