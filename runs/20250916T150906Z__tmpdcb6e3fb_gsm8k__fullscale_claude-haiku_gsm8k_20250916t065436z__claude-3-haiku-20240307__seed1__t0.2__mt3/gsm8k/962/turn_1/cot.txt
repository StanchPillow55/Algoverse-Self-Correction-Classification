Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jen needs to pay $400 for the supplies he needs in total.
- The tickets for travel cost, in total, 50% more than the supplies.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the travel tickets.
Cost of supplies = $400
Cost of travel tickets = Cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies
Cost of travel tickets = $400 + (0.5 Ã— $400)
Cost of travel tickets = $400 + $200
Cost of travel tickets = $600

Step 2: Provide the final answer.
The travel cost is $600.

Explanation:
To find the total cost of the travel tickets, we need to add 50% of the cost of the supplies to the cost of the supplies. 
The cost of the supplies is $400, and 50% of $400 is $200. 
Therefore, the total cost of the travel tickets is $400 + $200 = $600.
