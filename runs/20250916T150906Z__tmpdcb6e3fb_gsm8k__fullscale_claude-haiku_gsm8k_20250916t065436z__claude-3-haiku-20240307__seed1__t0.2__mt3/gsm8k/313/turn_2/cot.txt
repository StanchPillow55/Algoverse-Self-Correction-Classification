Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now.
- Currently, Cera is 46 years old.
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Step 1: Find Noah's age six years ago.
Since Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 40 years old.
When Noah was half as old as Cera, he was 20 years old (40 / 2 = 20).

Step 2: Find the population of Chile six years ago.
The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.
Noah's age six years ago was 20 years.
Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 Ã— 20 = 60,000.

Step 3: Find the current population of Chile.
The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half of what it is now.
Current population
