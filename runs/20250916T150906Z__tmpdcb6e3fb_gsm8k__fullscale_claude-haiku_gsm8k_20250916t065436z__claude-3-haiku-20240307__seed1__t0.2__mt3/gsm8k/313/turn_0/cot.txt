To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find Noah's age six years ago.
2. Find Cera's age six years ago.
3. Find the population of Chile six years ago.
4. Find the population of Chile now.

Step 1: Find Noah's age six years ago.
Given information:
- Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera.
- Currently, Cera is 46 years old.

Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40 years old
Noah's age six years ago = 40 / 2 = 20 years old

Step 2: Find Cera's age six years ago.
Cera's age six years ago = 46 - 6 = 40 years old

Step 3: Find the population of Chile six years ago.
Given information:
- The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah.

Population of Chile six years ago = 3000 Ã— 20 = 60,000

Step 4: Find the population of Chile
