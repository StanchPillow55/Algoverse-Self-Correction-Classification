To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat, and then calculate the average time for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.

Given information:
- The cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.
- The dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for the dog to eat the same number of sausages as the cat.
Time taken by the cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by the dog = 2/3 Ã— 30 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the average time for the cat and the dog to eat the sausages.
Average time = (Time taken by the cat + Time taken by the dog) / 2
Average time = (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 25 minutes

Therefore, the average time the cat and the dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.
