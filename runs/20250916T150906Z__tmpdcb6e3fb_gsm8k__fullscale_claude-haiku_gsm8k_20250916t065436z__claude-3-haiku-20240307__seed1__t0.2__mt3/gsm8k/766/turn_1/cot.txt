Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marissa bought a ball for $20.
- Marissa had $80 on her.
- Candy bars are sold at $5 each.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Marissa had left after buying the ball.
Amount of money left = Total money - Cost of the ball
Amount of money left = $80 - $20 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the number of candy bars Marissa could buy with the remaining $60.
Number of candy bars = Amount of money left / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars = $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.
