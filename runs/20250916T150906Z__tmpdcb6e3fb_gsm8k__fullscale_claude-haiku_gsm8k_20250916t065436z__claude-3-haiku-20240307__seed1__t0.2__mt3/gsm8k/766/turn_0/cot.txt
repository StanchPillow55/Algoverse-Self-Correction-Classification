Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marissa bought a ball for $20.
- Marissa had $80 on her.
- Candy bars are sold at $5 each.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Marissa had left after buying the ball.
Amount of money Marissa had left = Total money Marissa had - Cost of the ball
Amount of money Marissa had left = $80 - $20 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the number of candy bars Marissa could buy for Jimmy with the remaining $60.
Cost of each candy bar = $5
Number of candy bars Marissa could buy = Amount of money Marissa had left / Cost of each candy bar
Number of candy bars Marissa could buy = $60 / $5 = 12 candy bars

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

Final answer: Marissa bought 12 candy bars for her brother Jimmy.
