Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lana has 27 cups in total.
- She divides the cups into 3 rows.
- In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
- The remaining cups are used to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Step 1: Determine the number of cups in each row.
Total cups / Number of rows = Cups per row
27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups per row

Step 2: Determine the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row.
Since Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row, we can divide the number of cups per row by 2 to get the number of cups of each type of tea.
Cups per row / 2 = Cups of chamomile and mint tea per row
9 cups per row / 2 = 4.5 cups of chamomile and 4.5 cups of mint tea per row

Step 3: Determine the
