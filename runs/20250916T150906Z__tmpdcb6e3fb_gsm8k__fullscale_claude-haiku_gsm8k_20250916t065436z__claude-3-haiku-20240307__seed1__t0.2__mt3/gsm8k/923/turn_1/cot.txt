Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lana has 27 cups total.
2. She divides these cups into 3 rows.
3. In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
4. The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

To find the number of mint tea cups in each row, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.
2. Divide that number by 2 to get the number of cups for each type of tea.
3. Divide the number of cups for each type of tea by 3 to get the number in each row.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.
Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups = Chamomile and mint tea cups
27 - 15 = 12 cups

Step 2: Divide the total chamomile and mint tea cups by 2 to get the number of cups for each type of tea.
12 cups / 2
