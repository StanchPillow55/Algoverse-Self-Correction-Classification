To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
We need to find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially.

Step 2: Set up the equation.
Let the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had initially be x hectares.

After selling 3/5 of his land, he had 12.8 hectares left.
This means that 2/5 of the land (the remaining portion) is 12.8 hectares.

Step 3: Solve the equation.
2/5 of x = 12.8
x = 12.8 Ã— 5/2
x = 32 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Final answer: Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.
