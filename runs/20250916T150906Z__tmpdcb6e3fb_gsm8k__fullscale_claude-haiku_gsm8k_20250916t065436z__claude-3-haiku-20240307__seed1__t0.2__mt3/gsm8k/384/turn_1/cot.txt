Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

To find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to work backwards from the remaining land.

Step 1: Determine the amount of land Mr. Ruther sold.
Since he sold 3/5 of his land, the amount of land he sold is 3/5 of the total.
Let's call the total amount of land he had at first as "x" hectares.
Amount of land sold = 3/5 × x hectares

Step 2: Find the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.
Amount of land left after the sale = 12.8 hectares
Amount of land sold + Amount of land left = Total amount of land
(3/5 × x) + 12.8 = x

Step 3: Solve for the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first.
(3/5 ×
