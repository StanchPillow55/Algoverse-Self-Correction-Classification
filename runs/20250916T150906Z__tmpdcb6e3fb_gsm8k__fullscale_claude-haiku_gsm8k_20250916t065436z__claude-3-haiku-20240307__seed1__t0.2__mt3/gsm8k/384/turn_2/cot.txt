Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land.
- He had 12.8 hectares left after the sale.

To find the total amount of land he had at first, we need to work backwards from the remaining land.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of land sold.
Since Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, the remaining 2/5 of the land is 12.8 hectares.

Let's call the total amount of land he had at first as "x" hectares.
Then, 2/5 of x = 12.8 hectares
x = 12.8 รท (2/5)
x = 32 hectares

Step 2: Calculate the amount of land sold.
Amount of land sold = 3/5 of x
Amount of land sold = 3/5 ร 32 = 19.2 hectares

Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 32 hectares of land at first.

Final answer: Mr
