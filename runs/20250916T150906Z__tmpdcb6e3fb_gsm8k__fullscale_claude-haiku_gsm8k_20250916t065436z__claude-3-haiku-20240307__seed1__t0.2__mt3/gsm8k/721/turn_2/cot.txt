Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Helga can tap her right foot at 300 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga can tap her left foot at 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 of those 5 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of taps with arms at her sides.
Right foot taps with arms at sides = 300 taps/min × 3 min = 900 taps
Left foot taps with arms at sides = 250 taps/min × 3 min = 750 taps
Total taps with arms at sides = 900 + 750 = 1650 taps

Step 2: Calculate the number of taps with arms raised.
Right foot taps with arms raised = 200 t
