To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps for both feet during the 5-minute dance routine, considering the different tap rates when Helga's arms are at her sides and when they are raised.

Given information:
- Helga's tap rate with her right foot is 300 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga's tap rate with her left foot is 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga's tap rate with each foot is 200 taps per minute when her arms are raised.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of taps for the right foot.
When arms are at her sides (3 minutes):
Right foot taps = 300 taps/minute × 3 minutes = 900 taps
When arms are raised (2 minutes):
Right foot taps = 200 taps/minute × 2 minutes = 400 taps
Total right foot taps =
