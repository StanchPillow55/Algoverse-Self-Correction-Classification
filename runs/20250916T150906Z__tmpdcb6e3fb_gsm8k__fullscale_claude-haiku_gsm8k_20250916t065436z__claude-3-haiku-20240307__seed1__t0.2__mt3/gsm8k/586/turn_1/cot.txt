Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Hannah burns 500 calories per hour during aerobics for 2 hours.
   * Calories burned during aerobics = 500 calories/hour x 2 hours = 1,000 calories

2. Hannah burns 600 calories per hour during running for 1 hour.
   * Calories burned during running = 600 calories/hour x 1 hour = 600 calories

3. Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running
   * Total calories burned = 1,000 calories + 600 calories = 1,600 calories

4. For every 200 calories burned, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water.
   * Water needed = (1,600 calories / 200 calories) x 100 ml = 800 ml

Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is 800 ml.
