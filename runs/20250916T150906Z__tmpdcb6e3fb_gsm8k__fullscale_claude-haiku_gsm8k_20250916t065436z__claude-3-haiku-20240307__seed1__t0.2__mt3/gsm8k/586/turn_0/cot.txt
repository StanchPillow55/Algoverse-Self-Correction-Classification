Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.
- She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour.
- She spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of calories burned during the aerobics session.
Calories burned during aerobics = 500 calories/hour × 2 hours = 1,000 calories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories burned during the running session.
Calories burned during running = 600 calories/hour × 1 hour = 600 calories

Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories burned.
Total calories burned = Calories burned during aerobics + Calories burned during running
Total calories burned = 1,000 calories + 600 calories = 1,600 calories

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink.
Water needed = (Total calories burned / 200 calories) × 100 ml
