Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lorraine starts with:
   - 30 small stickers
   - 40 large stickers

2. Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons:
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button
   - So, Lorraine trades 27 small stickers for 27 small buttons

3. Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons:
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button
   - So, Lorraine trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons

4. Lorraine trades the remaining 50% of her large stickers for small buttons:
   - Remaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers
   -
