Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* The nurses used 38 bandages
* They ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages

Day 2:
* They used 10 fewer bandages than Day 1, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages

Day 3:
* They ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so 2 * 50 = 100 bandages
* They used half a pack, so 50 / 2 = 25 bandages

At the end of Day 3, they had 78 bandages left.

To find the total number of bandages they started with on the first day, we need to add up all the bandages used and the bandages left:

Bandages used:
* Day 1: 38
* Day 2: 28
* Day 3: 25
Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91

Bandages left at end of Day 3: 78
