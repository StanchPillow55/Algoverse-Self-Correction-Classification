Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* The nurses used 38 bandages
* They ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages

Day 2:
* They used 10 fewer bandages than Day 1, so 38 - 10 = 28 bandages used

Day 3:
* They ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so 2 x 50 = 100 bandages
* They used half a pack, so 50 / 2 = 25 bandages used
* They had 78 bandages left at the end of the day

To find the total number of bandages they started with on the first day, we need to add up all the bandages used and the bandages left:

Bandages used:
* Day 1: 38
* Day 2: 28
* Day 3: 25
Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91

Bandages ordered:
* Day 1: 50
* Day
