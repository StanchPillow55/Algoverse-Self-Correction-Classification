Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the volume of the pool:
   * The pool is 14 feet wide, 25 feet long, and 4 feet deep.
   * Volume = length x width x depth
   * Volume = 14 feet x 25 feet x 4 feet
   * Volume = 1,400 cubic feet

2. Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons:
   * The pool company instructed to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons.
   * Gallons = Volume x 5.9
   * Gallons = 1,400 cubic feet x 5.9
   * Gallons = 8,260 gallons

3. Calculate the cost to fill the pool:
   * The cost is $0.10 per gallon.
   * Total cost = Gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = 8,260 gallons x $0.10 per gallon
   * Total cost = $826.00

Therefore, the total
