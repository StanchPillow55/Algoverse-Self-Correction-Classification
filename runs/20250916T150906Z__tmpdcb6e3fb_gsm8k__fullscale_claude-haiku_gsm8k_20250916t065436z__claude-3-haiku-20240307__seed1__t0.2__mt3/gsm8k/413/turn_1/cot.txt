Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode
- 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog

Step 1: Calculate the number of candles that are not guaranteed not to explode.
Total candles - Candles guaranteed not to explode = Candles that may explode
50,000 - (50,000 × 0.99) = 50,000 - 49,500 = 500 candles that may explode

Step 2: Calculate the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
Candles that may explode × Percentage of candles with wet dog defect = Candles that smell like wet dog
500 × 0.05 = 25 candles that smell like wet dog

Step 3: Calculate the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and may explode.
Candles that smell like wet dog = 25
Since all the candles that smell like
