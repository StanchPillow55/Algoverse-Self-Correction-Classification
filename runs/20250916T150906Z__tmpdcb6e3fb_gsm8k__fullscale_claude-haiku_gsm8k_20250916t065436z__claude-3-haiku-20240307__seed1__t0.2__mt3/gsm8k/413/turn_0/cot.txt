To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and have the potential to explode.

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles (1% of the total) have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Step 1: Find the number of candles that have the potential to explode.
Total number of candles = 50,000
Percentage of candles that are guaranteed not to explode = 99%
Percentage of candles that have the potential to explode = 1%
Number of candles that have the potential to explode = 50,000 × 1% = 500 candles

Step 2: Find the number of candles that smell like wet dog.
Percentage of candles that have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog = 5% of the more dangerous candles (1% of the total)
Number of candles that smell like wet dog = 50,000 × 5%
