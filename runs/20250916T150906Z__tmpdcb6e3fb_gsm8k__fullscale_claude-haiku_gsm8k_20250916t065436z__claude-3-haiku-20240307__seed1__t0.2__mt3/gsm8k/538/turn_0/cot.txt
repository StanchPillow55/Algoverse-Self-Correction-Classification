To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far and then subtract it from the total number of vlogs she needs to make per month to determine the remaining number of vlogs she should do.

Given information:
- Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
- Emma made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far.
Vlogs made in the first week = 18
Vlogs made in the second week = 21
Vlogs made in the third week = 15
Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of vlogs Emma should do to complete the 72 vlogs per month.
Total vlogs per month = 72
Vlogs made so far = 54
Remaining vlogs to be made = 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make
