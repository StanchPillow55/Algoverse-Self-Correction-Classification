Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
- In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
- In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
- In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

To find how many vlogs she should do to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of vlogs she has made so far.
2. Subtract the total number of vlogs made from the target of 72 vlogs per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vlogs made so far.
Vlogs made in the first week: 18
Vlogs made in the second week: 21
Vlogs made in the third week: 15
Total vlogs made so far = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of vlogs needed to complete the 72 vlogs per month.
Target vlogs per month: 72
