Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Emma can make and upload 72 vlogs per month.
2. In the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
3. In the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
4. In the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

To find out how many more vlogs she needs to complete the 72 vlogs per month, we need to add up the vlogs she has already made and subtract that from the total of 72 vlogs.

Vlogs made in the first 3 weeks:
* Week 1: 18 vlogs
* Week 2: 21 vlogs 
* Week 3: 15 vlogs
* Total vlogs made in the first 3 weeks = 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs

Now, we subtract the 54 vlogs made from the total of 72 vlogs per month:
* 72 vlogs - 54 vlogs = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma should make 18 more
