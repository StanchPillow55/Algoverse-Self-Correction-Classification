Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jon drives 100 miles per day.
2. There are 30 days in a month.
3. So, in a 30-day month, Jon drives:
   * 100 miles per day x 30 days = 3,000 miles

4. Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1,000 miles.
5. To find how many tune-ups he needs in a 30-day month, we divide the total miles driven by the tune-up interval:
   * 3,000 miles / 1,000 miles per tune-up = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, the number of tune-ups Jon needs in a 30-day month is 3.

Final answer: Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.
