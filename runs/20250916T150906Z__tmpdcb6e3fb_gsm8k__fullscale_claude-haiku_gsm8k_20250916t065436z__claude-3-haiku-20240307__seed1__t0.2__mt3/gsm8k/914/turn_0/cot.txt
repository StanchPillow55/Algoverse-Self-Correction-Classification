To solve this problem, we need to find out how many miles Jon drives in a 30-day month and then determine how many tune-ups he needs based on the recommended tune-up interval.

Given information:
- Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
- Jon drives 100 miles a day for a 30-day month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of miles Jon drives in a 30-day month.
Total miles driven in a month = Miles per day × Number of days in a month
Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles × 30 days = 3,000 miles

Step 2: Determine the number of tune-ups needed based on the recommended tune-up interval.
Tune-up interval = 1,000 miles
Number of tune-ups needed = Total miles driven in a month / Tune-up interval
Number of tune-ups needed = 3,000 miles / 1,000 miles = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups for his car in a 30-day month.

Final answer: Jon needs
