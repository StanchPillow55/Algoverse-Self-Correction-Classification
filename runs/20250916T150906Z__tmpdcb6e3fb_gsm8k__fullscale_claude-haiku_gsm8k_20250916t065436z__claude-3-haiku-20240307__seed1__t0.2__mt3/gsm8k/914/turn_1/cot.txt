Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.
- Jon drives 100 miles a day.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven in a month.
Miles driven per day × Days in a month = Total miles driven in a month
100 miles × 30 days = 3,000 miles

Step 2: Determine how many tune-ups are needed in a month.
Total miles driven in a month / Miles between tune-ups = Number of tune-ups needed
3,000 miles / 1,000 miles = 3 tune-ups

Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in a 30-day month.
