Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the cost of the peaches:
   * Peaches: 6 pounds x $2.00 per pound = $12.00

2. Calculate the cost of the plums:
   * Plums: 8 pounds x $1.00 per pound = $8.00

3. Calculate the cost of the apricots:
   * Apricots: 6 pounds x $3.00 per pound = $18.00

4. Add up the total cost of all the fruit:
   * Total cost = $12.00 (peaches) + $8.00 (plums) + $18.00 (apricots) = $38.00

Therefore, the total amount Winston spent on fruit is $38.00.
