To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit that Winston picked.

Given information:
- Peaches: $2.00 per pound
- Plums: $1.00 per pound
- Apricots: $3.00 per pound
- Winston picked:
  - 6 pounds of peaches
  - 8 pounds of plums
  - 6 pounds of apricots

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the peaches.
Cost of peaches = 6 pounds × $2.00 per pound = $12.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the plums.
Cost of plums = 8 pounds × $1.00 per pound = $8.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the apricots.
Cost of apricots = 6 pounds × $3.00 per pound = $18.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the fruit.
Total cost = Cost of peaches + Cost of plums + Cost of apricots
Total cost = $12.00 + $8.00
