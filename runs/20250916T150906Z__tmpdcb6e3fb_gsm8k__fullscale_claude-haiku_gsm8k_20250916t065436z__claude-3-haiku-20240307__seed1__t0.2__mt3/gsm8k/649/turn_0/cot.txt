To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
2. Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.

Step 1: Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
* Initial number of likes: 2,000
* After 3 weeks, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
* Number of likes after 3 weeks = 2,000 Ã— 70 = 140,000

Step 2: Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.
* Total number of likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 160,000.

Final answer: 160,000 Instagram likes.
