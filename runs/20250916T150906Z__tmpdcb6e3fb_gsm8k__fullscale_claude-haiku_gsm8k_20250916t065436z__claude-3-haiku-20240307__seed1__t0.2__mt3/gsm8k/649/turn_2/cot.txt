Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.

2. Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
   * Initial number of likes: 2000
   * 3 weeks later, the number of likes = 70 x 2000 = 140,000

3. Recently, she received 20,000 more new likes.
   * Total likes = Initial likes + New likes
   * Total likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000

Therefore, the final answer is that Fishio has 160,000 Instagram likes.
