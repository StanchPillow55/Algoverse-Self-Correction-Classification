Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 6 more candies than Robert.
- John has twice as many candies as Robert.
- John has 54 candies.

Step 1: Find how many candies Robert has.
Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can use this equation:
John's candies = 2 × Robert's candies
54 = 2 × Robert's candies
Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27 candies

Step 2: Find how many candies James has.
James has 6 more candies than Robert, so:
James' candies = Robert's candies + 6
James' candies = 27 + 6 = 33 candies

Step 3: Find how many more candies John has than James.
John's candies - James' candies = 54 - 33 = 21 candies

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

Final answer: John has 21 more candies than James
