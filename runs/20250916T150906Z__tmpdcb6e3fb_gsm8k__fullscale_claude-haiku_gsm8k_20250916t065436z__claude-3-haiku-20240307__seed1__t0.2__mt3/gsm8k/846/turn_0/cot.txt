To solve this problem, we need to find the total time available for the performances and then calculate the number of groups that can perform within that time.

Given information:
- The concert duration is 2 hours (120 minutes).
- Each group is allowed 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage.
- There is a 10-minute intermission.

Step 1: Calculate the total time available for performances.
Total concert duration = 120 minutes
Time for intermission = 10 minutes
Time available for performances = Total concert duration - Time for intermission
Time available for performances = 120 minutes - 10 minutes = 110 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time required for each group's performance.
Time for each group = Time to get on stage + Time to perform + Time to exit the stage
Time for each group = 2 minutes + 6 minutes + 2 minutes = 10 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of groups that can perform in the concert.
Number of groups = Time available for performances / Time required for each group
Number of groups
