To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Mason traveled during his bike journey.

Given information:
- Mason's bike journey rate is 8 miles per hour.
- He travels for 4 hours, takes some rest, and then goes on for another 6 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 hours.
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = Rate × Time
Distance traveled in the first 4 hours = 8 miles per hour × 4 hours = 32 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 6 hours.
Distance traveled in the next 6 hours = Rate × Time
Distance traveled in the next 6 hours = 8 miles per hour × 6 hours = 48 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled in the first 4 hours + Distance traveled in the next 6 hours
Total distance traveled = 32 miles + 48 miles = 80 miles

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles during his bike journey.

Final answer: Mason
