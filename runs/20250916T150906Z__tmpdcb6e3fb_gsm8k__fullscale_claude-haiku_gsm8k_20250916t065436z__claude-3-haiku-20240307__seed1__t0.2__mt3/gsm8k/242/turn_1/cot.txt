Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mike was a pen pal with 5 people.
- He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
- Each of the remaining 3 pen pals sends 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.
- Mike responds in kind.
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives per week.
Number of remaining pen pals = 3
Number of letters received per week from each pen pal = 2
Number of pages per letter = 5
Total number of pages received per week = 3 × 2 × 5 = 30 pages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Mike needs to write per week.
Since Mike responds in kind, the total number of pages he needs to write per week is also 30 pages.

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes Mike to write 30 pages.
Time to write 1 page = 6 minutes
Time to write 30 pages = 30 ×
