Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
- Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours.
- They worked for 12 hours in a day.

Step 1: Calculate how many pounds of chocolates Ruiz can make in one hour.
Ruiz's chocolate production in two hours = 120 pounds
Ruiz's chocolate production in one hour = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds

Step 2: Calculate how many pounds of chocolates Marissa can make in one hour.
Marissa's chocolate production in one hour = 3/4 × Ruiz's chocolate production in two hours
Marissa's chocolate production in one hour = 3/4 × 120 pounds = 90 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours.
Ruiz's total chocolate production in 12 hours = 60 pounds/hour ×
