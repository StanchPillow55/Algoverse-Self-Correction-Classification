To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa separately, and then add them together to get the total amount of chocolate pounds made.

Given information:
- Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours.
- Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours.
- They worked for 12 hours in a day.

Step 1: Find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz.
Ruiz's chocolate pounds per hour = 120 pounds / 2 hours = 60 pounds per hour
Ruiz's chocolate pounds in 12 hours = 60 pounds per hour × 12 hours = 720 pounds

Step 2: Find the amount of chocolate pounds made by Marissa.
Marissa's chocolate pounds per hour = 3/4 × Ruiz's chocolate pounds per two hours
Marissa's chocolate pounds per hour = 3/4 × (120 pounds / 2 hours) = 45 pounds per hour
