To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours the firefighters need to fundraise to reach their goal of $6300, assuming an equal amount is raised in every hour.

Given information:
- The firefighters' goal is to raise $6300.
- After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised per hour.
Amount raised in the first 3 hours = $2100
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount to be raised.
Remaining amount to be raised = Goal - Amount raised in the first 3 hours
Remaining amount to be raised = $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.
Total hours needed = Remaining amount to be raised / Amount raised per hour
Total hours needed = $4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 9 hours (3 hours already completed + 6
