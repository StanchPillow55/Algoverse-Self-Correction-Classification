Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fundraising goal is $6300.
- After the first 3 hours, they have raised $2100.
- Assume an equal amount is raised in every hour.

Step 1: Calculate the amount raised per hour.
Amount raised in 3 hours = $2100
Amount raised per hour = $2100 / 3 hours = $700 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount to be raised.
Remaining amount to be raised = Goal - Amount raised so far
Remaining amount to be raised = $6300 - $2100 = $4200

Step 3: Calculate the number of hours needed to raise the remaining amount.
Remaining amount to be raised / Amount raised per hour = Number of hours needed
$4200 / $700 per hour = 6 hours

Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 3 hours (the initial 3 hours) + 6 hours (the remaining hours) = 9 hours to reach their goal of $6300.

Final answer:
