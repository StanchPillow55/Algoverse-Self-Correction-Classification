To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
2. Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.

Step 1: Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.

Total number of passengers = Number of men + Number of women
84 = 5x + 9x
84 = 14x
x = 6

Therefore, the number of men on the bus initially is 5x = 5 × 6 = 30.
The number of women on the bus initially is 9x = 9 × 6 = 54.

Step 2: Calculate the number of women who have remained on the bus after 20 women alighted.
Number of women who have remained on the bus = Initial number of
