Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcy works for the same company for 40 years.
- She gets an annual pension of $50,000/year.
- After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
- She quits after 30 years.

Step 1: Calculate the total pension Marcy would have received if she worked for the full 40 years.
Total pension for 40 years = $50,000 x 40 years = $2,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount of pension Marcy is entitled to after 20 years.
Pension entitlement after 20 years = 5% of $2,000,000 = $100,000/year

Step 3: Calculate the pension Marcy will receive if she quits after 30 years.
Pension for the first 20 years = $50,000 x 20 years = $1,000,000
Pension for the remaining 10 years = $100,000 x
