To solve this problem, we need to calculate Marcy's annual pension based on the given information.

Given information:
- Marcy works for the same company for 40 years.
- Her annual pension is $50,000/year.
- After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.
- Marcy quits after 30 years.

Step 1: Calculate the total pension Marcy has earned after 20 years.
Total pension earned after 20 years = $50,000 × 20 years = $1,000,000

Step 2: Calculate the annual pension Marcy is entitled to after 20 years.
Annual pension after 20 years = 5% of the total pension earned
Annual pension after 20 years = 0.05 × $1,000,000 = $50,000

Step 3: Calculate the annual pension Marcy will receive after quitting at 30 years.
Annual pension after 30 years = $50,000 + (0.05 × $1,000,000) = $
