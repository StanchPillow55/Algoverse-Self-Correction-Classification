Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each pack of bagels costs $10.00 and has 9 bagels in the pack.
- Russell orders 4 packs of bagels.
- He will receive a 10% discount on the total order.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels without the discount.
Total cost without discount = 4 packs × $10.00 per pack = $40.00

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount amount = 10% of $40.00 = 0.10 × $40.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the order with the 10% discount.
Total cost with discount = $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00

Total number of bagels = 4 packs × 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels

Step 5: Calculate the cost per single bagel.
