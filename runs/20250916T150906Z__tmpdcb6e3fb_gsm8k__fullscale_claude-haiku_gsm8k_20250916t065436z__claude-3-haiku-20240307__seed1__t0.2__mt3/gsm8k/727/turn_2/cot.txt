Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Students' cars:
   * There are 64 students' cars
   * Each car has 4 windows
   * Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows

To calculate the number of students' car windows smashed:
* Total students' car windows = 64 cars x 4 windows/car = 256 windows
* Hannah smashes 1/4 of 256 windows = 256 x 1/4 = 64 windows

2. Teachers' cars:
   * There are 32 teachers' cars
   * Each car has 2 windows
   * Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows

To calculate the number of teachers' car windows smashed:
* Total teachers' car windows = 32 cars x 2 windows/car = 64 windows
* Hannah smashes 3/4 of 64 windows = 64 x 3/4 = 48 windows

3. Total windows smashed:
   * Students' car
