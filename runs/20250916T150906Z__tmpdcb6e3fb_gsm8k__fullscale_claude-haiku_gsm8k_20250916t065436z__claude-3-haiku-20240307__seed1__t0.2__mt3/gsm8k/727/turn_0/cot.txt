Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars.
Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars × 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars.

Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars × 2 windows per car = 64 windows

Step 4: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars.
Windows smashed in teachers'
