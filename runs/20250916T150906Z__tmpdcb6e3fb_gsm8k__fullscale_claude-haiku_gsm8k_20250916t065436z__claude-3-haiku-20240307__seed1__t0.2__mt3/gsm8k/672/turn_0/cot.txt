Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Christina recorded her mood over the past 30 days.
- She had 12 good days, 8 bad days, and the rest were neutral.
- The first 8 days were good, the second 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral.
- The next 3 days were good, neutral, and good.

Step 1: Calculate the number of neutral days.
Total days = 30
Good days = 12
Bad days = 8
Neutral days = Total days - Good days - Bad days
Neutral days = 30 - 12 - 8 = 10

Step 2: Determine the number of good days left in the month.
Good days in the first 8 days = 8
Good days in the next 3 days = 2
Good days left = 12 - 8 - 2 = 2

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 2.

Final answer: 2 good days left in the month.
