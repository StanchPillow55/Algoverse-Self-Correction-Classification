Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- The school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies.
- April had already bought 100 plant pots before knowing the school's requirements.

Step 1: Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
Number of plant pots needed for the roses = 2 Ã— 30 = 60 plant pots

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plant pots needed by the school.
Total plant pots needed = Plant pots for daisies + Plant pots for roses
Total plant pots needed = 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots

Step 3: Calculate the number of plant pots April has left over.
Plant pots April had bought = 100
Plant pots needed by the school = 90
Plant pots left over = 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots

Therefore, April has 10 plant pots left over.
