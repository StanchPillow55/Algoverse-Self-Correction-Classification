To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water Colorado City uses from the Colorado River.
2. Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.
3. Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.
4. Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Colorado City uses from the Colorado River.
Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
This means that Colorado City uses 40% of the river's total water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.
80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes.
This means that 80% of the 40% of the river's total water used by the city is used for industrial purposes.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.
The remaining 20% of the 40% of the river's total water used by the city is used for non-industrial purposes.
This means that 20% of the 40% of the river's total water is used for non-
