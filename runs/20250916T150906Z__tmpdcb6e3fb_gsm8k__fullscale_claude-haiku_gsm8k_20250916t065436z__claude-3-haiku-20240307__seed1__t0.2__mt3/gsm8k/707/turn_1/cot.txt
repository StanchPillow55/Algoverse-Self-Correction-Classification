Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
3. To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage used for industrial purposes, then subtract that from the total 40%.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes.
40% of the river's water is used by Colorado City.
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
So, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is:
40% Ã— 80% = 32%

Step 2: Calculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.
The total water used by Colorado City is 40%.
The water used for industrial purposes is 32%.
Therefore, the water used for non-industrial purposes is:
40% - 32% = 8%

Final answer: 8% of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.
