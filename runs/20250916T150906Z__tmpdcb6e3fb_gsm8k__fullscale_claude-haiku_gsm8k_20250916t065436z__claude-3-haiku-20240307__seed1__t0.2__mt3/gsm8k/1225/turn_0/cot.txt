Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes.
- Carly's class has 5 people.
- Each person gets 2 treats.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of cupcakes Carly made.
- Then, the number of brownies Carly made is 3x - 2.

Step 1: Find the total number of treats Carly needs to make.
Total number of treats = 2 treats per person Ã— 5 people = 10 treats

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the number of cupcakes Carly made.
Total number of treats = Number of cupcakes + Number of brownies
10 = x + (3x - 2)

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
10 = x + 3x - 2
10 = 4x - 2
12 = 4x
x = 3

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupc
