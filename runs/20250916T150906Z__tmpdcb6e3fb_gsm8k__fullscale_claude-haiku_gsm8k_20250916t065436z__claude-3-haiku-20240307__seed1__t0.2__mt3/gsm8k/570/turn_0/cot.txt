Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has $70 to spend.
- He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
- From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
- For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter can spend each day.
Total amount: $70
Number of days: 7 days
Amount per day = $70 / 7 days = $10 per day

Step 2: Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday through Wednesday.
Number of days: 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday)
Amount spent per day: $10
Cost of each wooden action figure: $5
Number of wooden action figures = (4 days × $10 per day) / $5 per figure = 8 wooden action figures

Step 3: Calculate how much money Peter has left for the rest of the week.
Total amount: $70
Amount spent on wooden action figures: 8 figures × $
