Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Peter has $70 to spend.
2. He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days).
3. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
4. For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

First, let's calculate how much Peter spent on the wooden action figures:
* 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday) x $5 per figure = $20 spent on wooden figures

Now, let's calculate how much money Peter has left to spend on the plastic action figures:
* $70 total - $20 spent on wooden figures = $50 remaining

Since the plastic action figures cost $2 each, we can divide the remaining $50 by $2 to find out how many plastic action figures he can buy:
* $50 / $2 per figure = 25 plastic action figures

Therefore, the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is:
* 4 wooden action
