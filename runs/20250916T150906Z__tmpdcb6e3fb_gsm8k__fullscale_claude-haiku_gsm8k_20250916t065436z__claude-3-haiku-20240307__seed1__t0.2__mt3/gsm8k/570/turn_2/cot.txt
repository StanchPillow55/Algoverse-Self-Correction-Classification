Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has $70 to spend.
- He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
- From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
- For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter can spend each day.
Total amount: $70
Number of days in a week: 7
Amount per day = $70 / 7 = $10

Step 2: Calculate how many wooden action figures Peter can buy from Sunday through Wednesday.
Number of days: 4
Amount spent per day: $5
Total amount spent on wooden action figures = 4 Ã— $5 = $20

Step 3: Calculate how much money Peter has left for the rest of the week.
Total amount: $70
Amount spent on wooden action figures: $20
Amount left = $70 - $20 = $50

Step 4: Calculate how many plastic action figures Peter can buy for the rest of the week.
