To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food.
- Each package of cat food contained 11 tins.
- Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.
- Each package of dog food contained 6 tins.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.
Total tins of cat food = Number of packages of cat food × Number of tins per package of cat food
Total tins of cat food = 8 × 11 = 88 tins

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.
Total tins of dog food = Number of packages of dog food × Number of tins per package of dog food
Total tins of dog food = 6 × 6 = 36 tins

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total tins of cat food and the total tins of dog food.
Difference in tins = Total tins
