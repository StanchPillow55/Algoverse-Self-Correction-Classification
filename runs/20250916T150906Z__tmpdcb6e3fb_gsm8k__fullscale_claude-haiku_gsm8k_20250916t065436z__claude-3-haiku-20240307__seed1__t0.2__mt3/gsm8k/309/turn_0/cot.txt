To solve this problem, we need to find the number of new arms and legs a person will grow after drinking the Lots-of-Limbs Serum for 15 days.

Given information:
- The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days.
- The serum will make the drinker grow an extra leg every five days.
- The time period is 15 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new arms the person will grow.
Number of days / Days per new arm = Number of new arms
15 days / 3 days per new arm = 5 new arms

Step 2: Calculate the number of new legs the person will grow.
Number of days / Days per new leg = Number of new legs
15 days / 5 days per new leg = 3 new legs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of new limbs the person will grow.
Total new limbs = New arms + New legs
Total new limbs = 5 new arms + 3 new legs = 8 new limbs

Therefore, after 15 days, Helena's Lots-
