Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jared's initial typing speed is 47 words per minute (WPM).
- After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM.
- He continues to increase his typing speed by 5 more words.

Step 1: Calculate Jared's final typing speed after the additional 5 word increase.
Final typing speed = 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the average of the three typing speed measurements.
Average = (Initial speed + Intermediate speed + Final speed) / 3
Average = (47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM) / 3
Average = 156 WPM / 3
Average = 52 WPM

Therefore, the average of the three typing speed measurements is 52 words per minute.
