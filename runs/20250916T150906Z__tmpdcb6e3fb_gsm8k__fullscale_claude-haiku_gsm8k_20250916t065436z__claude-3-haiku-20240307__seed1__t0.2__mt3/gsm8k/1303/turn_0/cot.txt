To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation, and then calculate how long it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.

Given information:
- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day.
- The dog digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day.
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation.
Number of holes dug per day × Number of days = Total number of holes dug
6 holes × 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Calculate the net number of holes that Nate needs to fill in.
Total number of holes dug - Number of holes filled in per day = Net number of holes to fill
84 holes - 9 holes per day = 75 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
