Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes per day.
- The dog digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes per day.
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate was on vacation.
Number of holes dug per day × Number of days = Total holes dug
6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes Nate needs to fill in.
Total holes dug = 84 holes

Step 3: Calculate the net number of holes filled in per day.
Holes filled in per day - Holes dug per night = Net holes filled in per day
9 holes/day - 6 holes/night = 3 holes/day

Step 4: Calculate the number of days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.
Total holes
