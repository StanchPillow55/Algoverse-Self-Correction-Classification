Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Gloria has to choose between a pair of boots and two pairs of high heels.
- The two pairs of high heels together cost $5 less than the boots.
- One pair of heels costs $33.
- The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair.

Step 1: Find the cost of the second pair of heels.
Cost of the second pair of heels = 2 Ã— $33 = $66

Step 2: Find the total cost of the two pairs of heels.
Total cost of the two pairs of heels = $33 + $66 = $99

Step 3: Find the cost of the boots.
Cost of the boots = Total cost of the two pairs of heels + $5
Cost of the boots = $99 + $5 = $104

Therefore, the boots cost $104.

Final answer: The boots cost $104.
