Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt.
- Carrie spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the quarters.
Value of quarters = 140 quarters × $0.25 per quarter = $35

Step 2: Calculate the value of the 3/5 of the twenties.
Value of 3/5 of the twenties = 3/5 × 10 twenties × $20 per twenty = $120

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch.
Total amount paid = Value of quarters + Value of 3/5 of the twenties
Total amount paid = $35 + $120 = $155

Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for the lunch is $155.
