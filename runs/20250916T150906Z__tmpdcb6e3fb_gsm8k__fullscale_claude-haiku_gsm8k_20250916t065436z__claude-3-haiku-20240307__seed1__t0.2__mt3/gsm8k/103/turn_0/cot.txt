To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

Given information:
- It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.
- The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the city.
City width = 42 miles
Number of 3-mile segments = 42 miles รท 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cover the entire city.
Time to cover each 3-mile segment = 10 minutes
Total time to cover the city = 14 segments ร 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes (or 2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

Final answer: It will take 140 minutes (2 hours and 20 minutes) for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
