Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city.
- The city is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

To find the total time it takes for the fog bank to cover the whole city, we need to calculate how many 3-mile segments are in the 42-mile city, and then multiply that by the time it takes to cover each 3-mile segment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile city.
Number of 3-mile segments = 42 miles / 3 miles per segment = 14 segments

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to cover the whole city.
Time to cover each 3-mile segment = 10 minutes
Total time to cover the city = 14 segments Ã— 10 minutes per segment = 140 minutes

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole 42-mile city.
