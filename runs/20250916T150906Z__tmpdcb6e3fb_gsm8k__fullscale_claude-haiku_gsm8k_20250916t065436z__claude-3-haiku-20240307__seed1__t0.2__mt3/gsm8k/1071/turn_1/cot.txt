Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The base cost to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 people.
2. The additional cost is $6 per person beyond the initial 20.
3. Kayla invited:
   - 25 classmates
   - 7 girls from her dance class
   - 13 family members
   - Total invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people
4. 4 people said they could not come, so the final number of attendees is:
   - 45 - 4 = 41 people
5. The additional cost for the 21 people beyond the initial 20 is:
   - 21 people x $6 per person = $126
6. The total cost for the party is:
   - Base cost: $125
   - Additional cost: $126
   - Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be $251.
