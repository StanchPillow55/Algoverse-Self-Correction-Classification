Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar.
- James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hangar.

To find the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the following:
1. The cost of the plane
2. The cost of renting the hangar for the first year
3. The cost of fuel for the first year

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane.
Cost of the plane = $150,000

Step 2: Calculate the cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
Cost of renting the hangar per month = $5,000
Cost of renting the hangar for the first year = $5,000 × 12 months = $60,000

Step 3: Calculate the cost of fuel for the first year.
Cost of fuel per month = 2 × $5,000 = $10,000
Cost of fuel for the first year = $10,
