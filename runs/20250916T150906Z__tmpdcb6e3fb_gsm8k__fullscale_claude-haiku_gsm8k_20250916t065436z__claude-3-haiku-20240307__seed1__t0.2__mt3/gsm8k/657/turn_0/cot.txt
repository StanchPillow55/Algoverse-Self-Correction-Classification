To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.

Given information:
- The plane cost $150,000.
- James pays $5,000 per month to rent a hangar.
- James spends twice as much on fuel per month as he does on the hangar.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of renting the hangar for the first year.
Cost of renting the hangar per month = $5,000
Cost of renting the hangar for the first year = $5,000 × 12 months = $60,000

Step 2: Calculate the cost of fuel for the first year.
Cost of fuel per month = 2 × $5,000 = $10,000
Cost of fuel for the first year = $10,000 × 12 months = $120,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.
Total cost = Cost of the plane + Cost of renting the hangar for the first year + Cost of fuel for the first year
Total cost = $150,000 + $60
