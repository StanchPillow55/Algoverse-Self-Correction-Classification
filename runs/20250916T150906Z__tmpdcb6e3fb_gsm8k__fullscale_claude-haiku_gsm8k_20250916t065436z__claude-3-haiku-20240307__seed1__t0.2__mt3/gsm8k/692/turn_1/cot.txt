Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 crate of fruit contains 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
- The price of 1 apple is $0.5.
- The price of 1 banana is twice the price of 1 apple.
- The price of 1 orange is three times the price of 1 banana.

Step 1: Calculate the price of 1 banana.
Price of 1 banana = 2 × Price of 1 apple
Price of 1 banana = 2 × $0.5 = $1

Step 2: Calculate the price of 1 orange.
Price of 1 orange = 3 × Price of 1 banana
Price of 1 orange = 3 × $1 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fruits in the crate.
Cost of 5 bananas = 5 × $1 = $5
Cost of 12 apples = 12 × $0.
