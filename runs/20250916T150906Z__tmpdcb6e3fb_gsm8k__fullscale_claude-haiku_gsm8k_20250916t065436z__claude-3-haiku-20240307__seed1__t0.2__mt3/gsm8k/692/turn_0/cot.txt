To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each type of fruit and then calculate the total cost of the crate.

Given information:
- One crate of fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.
- The price of one apple is $0.5.
- The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple.
- The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana.

Step 1: Find the price of one banana.
Price of one banana = 2 × Price of one apple
Price of one banana = 2 × $0.5 = $1

Step 2: Find the price of one orange.
Price of one orange = 3 × Price of one banana
Price of one orange = 3 × $1 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the crate.
Cost of 5 bananas = 5 × $1 = $5
Cost of 12 apples = 12 × $0.5 = $6
Cost of 7 oranges = 7 ×
