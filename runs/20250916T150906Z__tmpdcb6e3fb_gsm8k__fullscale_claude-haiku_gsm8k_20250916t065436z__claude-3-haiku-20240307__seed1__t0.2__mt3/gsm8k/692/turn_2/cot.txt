Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the cost of each fruit:
   - Banana: 2 x $0.5 = $1 per banana
   - Apple: $0.5 per apple
   - Orange: 3 x $1 = $3 per orange

2. Calculate the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
   - Bananas: 5 x $1 = $5
   - Apples: 12 x $0.5 = $6
   - Oranges: 7 x $3 = $21

3. Add up the total cost of the fruits in one crate:
   - Total cost = $5 + $6 + $21 = $32

Therefore, the price for such a crate of fruit would be $32.
