Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- One day, she woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
- That day, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.

To find the total minutes she slept on her bed that day, we need to calculate the total time she was asleep, excluding the time she was sleepwalking.

Step 2: Calculate the time she was awake due to sleepwalking.
Time awake due to sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time she was awake due to waking up 5
