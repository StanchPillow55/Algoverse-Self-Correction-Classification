To solve this problem, we need to find the total time Kim spent sleeping on her bed that day.

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the usual sleeping time.
Usual sleeping time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time she woke up earlier.
Time she woke up earlier = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.

Step 3: Calculate the time she was actually sleeping on her bed.
Time she was sleeping on her bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 4: Subtract the time she was sleepwalking.
