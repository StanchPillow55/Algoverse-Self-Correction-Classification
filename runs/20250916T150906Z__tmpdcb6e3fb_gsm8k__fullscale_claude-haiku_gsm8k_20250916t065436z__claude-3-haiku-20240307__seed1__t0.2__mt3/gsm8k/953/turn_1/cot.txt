Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
- On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
- Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kim usually sleeps.
Usual sleep time = 6 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 8 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time Kim actually slept on the bed that day.
Usual wake up time = 6 a.m.
Actual wake up time = 6 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.
Time spent sleeping on the bed = 5:55 a.m. - 10 p.m. = 7 hours and 55 minutes

Step 3: Subtract the time Kim was sleepwalking from the total time
