Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll in the room.
- One red car costs $4.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- The cost of one action figure is $5.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the red cars.
Cost of 1 red car = $4
Cost of 5 red cars = 5 × $4 = $20

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the action figures.
Cost of 1 action figure = $5
Cost of 3 action figures = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the doll.
The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
Cost of the doll = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the toys.
Total cost = Cost of red cars + Cost of action figures + Cost of the doll
Total cost = $20 + $15
