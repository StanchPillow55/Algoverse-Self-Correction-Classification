Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
- He actually baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
- He dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool.
- He now has a total of 110 cookies.

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Henry meant to bake this year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Henry meant to bake this year.
Total cookies baked = 110 + 5 (dropped cookies) = 115 cookies
Henry baked 15 more cookies than he meant to, so:
Cookies Henry meant to bake = 115 - 15 = 100 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so:
Cookies Henry baked last year = 100 / 2 = 50 cookies

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Final answer: Henry baked 50 cookies last year.
