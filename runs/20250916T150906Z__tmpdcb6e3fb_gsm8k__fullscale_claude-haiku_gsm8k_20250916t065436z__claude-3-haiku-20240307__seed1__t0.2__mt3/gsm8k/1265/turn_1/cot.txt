Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Tim's recipe for 1 gallon of lemonade requires 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.
2. 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
3. Tim needs to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   * For 4 gallons, he will need 4 cups of lemon juice.
   * Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 4 x 6 = 24 lemons for the 4 gallons.
4. Tim's best friend Allen asked for an extra gallon that is twice as tart.
   * This means the extra gallon will require 2 cups of lemon juice.
   * Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, the extra gallon will require 2 x 6 = 12 lemons.

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim will need is:
* 24 lemons for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the party
*
