Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.
- Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
- After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to the oven.
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Total time the oven is on = 3 hours
Total temperature increase = 5 degrees Ã— 3 hours = 15 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the new temperature after the oven is turned off.
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to the oven = 15 degrees
New temperature after the oven is turned off = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window.
Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Total time the window is open = 30
