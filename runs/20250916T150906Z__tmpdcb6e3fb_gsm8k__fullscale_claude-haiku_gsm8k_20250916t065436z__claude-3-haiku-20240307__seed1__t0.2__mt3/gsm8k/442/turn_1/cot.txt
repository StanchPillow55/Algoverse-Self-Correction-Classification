Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial house temperature: 40 degrees

2. Baking for 3 hours:
   - Every hour the oven is on, the house temperature increases by 5 degrees
   - So for 3 hours, the temperature increases by 3 x 5 = 15 degrees
   - New temperature: 40 + 15 = 55 degrees

3. Opening the window for 30 minutes:
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open
   - For 30 minutes, the house cools down 2 x (30/10) = 6 degrees
   - New temperature: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

Final answer: The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.
