Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red
- Granny Red is 2 times as old as Sally Four
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo
- Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old

Step 1: Find the age of Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo.
Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, then:
Sally Four's age = 8 years

Step 2: Find the age of Granny Red.
Granny Red is 2 times as old as Sally Four.
Granny Red's age = 2 × Sally Four's age
Granny Red's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years

Step 3: Find the age of Sally Two.
Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red.
Sally Two's age = Granny Red's age + 3
Sally Two's age = 16
