Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
- The total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.

Let's represent Donovan's part as x minutes.

Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can represent Betsy's part as (x + 18) minutes.

The total time to make the meal is the sum of Betsy's part and Donovan's part:
Betsy's part + Donovan's part = Total time
(x + 18) + x = 98
2x + 18 = 98
2x = 80
x = 40

Therefore, Donovan's part took 40 minutes.

Now, we can calculate Betsy's part:
Betsy's part = Donovan's part + 18
Betsy's part = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes

Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.
