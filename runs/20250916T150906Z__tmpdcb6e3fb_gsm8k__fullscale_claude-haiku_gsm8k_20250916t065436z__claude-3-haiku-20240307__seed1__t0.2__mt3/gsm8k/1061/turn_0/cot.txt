To solve this problem, we need to find the duration of Betsy's part in making the meal.

Given information:
- Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
- The total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.

Let's represent the duration of Donovan's part as x minutes.

Step 1: Express the duration of Betsy's part in terms of Donovan's part.
Betsy's part = Donovan's part + 18 minutes
Betsy's part = x + 18 minutes

Step 2: Find the total time to make the meal.
Total time = Betsy's part + Donovan's part
98 minutes = (x + 18) + x
98 minutes = 2x + 18

Step 3: Solve for x (Donovan's part).
98 minutes = 2x + 18
80 minutes = 2x
x = 40 minutes

Step 4: Find the duration of Betsy's part.
Betsy's part = x + 18
Betsy's
