Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There are 30 students in Marissa's class.
2. Each student started the year with 10 pencils.
   * Total pencils in the class = 30 students x 10 pencils = 300 pencils

3. After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in the class were used.
   * Pencils used = 1/5 of 300 = 60 pencils
   * Pencils remaining = 300 - 60 = 240 pencils

4. At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.
   * Pencils remaining at the end of the year = 1/3 of 240 = 80 pencils

Therefore, the final answer is 80 pencils left.
