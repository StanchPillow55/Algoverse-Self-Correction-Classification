Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- There are 30 students in Marissa's class.
- Each student started the year with 10 pencils.
- After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils in class were used.
- At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
Total pencils at the start = Number of students × Number of pencils per student
Total pencils at the start = 30 × 10 = 300 pencils

Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils used after two months.
Pencils used after two months = 1/5 of the total pencils at the start
Pencils used after two months = 1/5 × 300 = 60 pencils

Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
Pencils remaining after two months = Total pencils at the start - Pencils used after two months
Pencils remaining after two
