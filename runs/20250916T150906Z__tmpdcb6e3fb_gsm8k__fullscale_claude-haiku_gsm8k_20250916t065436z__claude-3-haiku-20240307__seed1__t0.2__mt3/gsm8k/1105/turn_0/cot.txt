To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Lauren needs to save for her retirement period and then calculate how many more years she needs to work to reach that goal.

Given information:
- Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck.
- She plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years.
- She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary.
- Her current salary is $100,000.

Step 1: Calculate Lauren's annual savings.
Annual salary = $100,000
Savings rate = 20%
Annual savings = $100,000 × 0.20 = $20,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement period.
Retirement period = 20 years
Desired annual retirement income = $100,000 × 0.40 = $40,000
Total amount needed for retirement = $40,000 × 20 years = $800,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to reach her retirement goal.
Total amount needed for retirement = $800,000
Annual savings = $20,000
Number of
