To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the annual savings
2. Calculate the total amount needed for retirement
3. Calculate the number of years needed to save the required amount

Step 1: Calculate the annual savings
* Lauren's current salary is $100,000
* She is saving 20% of every paycheck
* Annual savings = 0.20 × $100,000 = $20,000

Step 2: Calculate the total amount needed for retirement
* Lauren plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary during retirement
* Annual retirement income = 0.40 × $100,000 = $40,000
* Retirement period = 20 years
* Total amount needed for retirement = $40,000 × 20 = $800,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of years needed to save the required amount
* Annual savings = $20,000
* Total amount needed for retirement = $800,000
* Number of years needed = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save the require
