To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement period.
2. Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs to save.
3. Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount.

Step 1: Calculate the amount Lauren needs to save for her retirement period.
* Lauren's current annual salary is $100,000.
* She plans to live with 40% of her current annual salary during retirement.
* The retirement period is 20 years.

Amount needed for retirement = (40% of $100,000) Ã— 20 years = $800,000

Step 2: Calculate the annual amount Lauren needs to save.
* Lauren is saving 20% of every paycheck.

Annual amount saved = 20% of $100,000 = $20,000

Step 3: Calculate the number of years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount.
* Amount needed for retirement = $800,000
* Annual amount saved = $20,000

Number of years needed to save the required amount = $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years
