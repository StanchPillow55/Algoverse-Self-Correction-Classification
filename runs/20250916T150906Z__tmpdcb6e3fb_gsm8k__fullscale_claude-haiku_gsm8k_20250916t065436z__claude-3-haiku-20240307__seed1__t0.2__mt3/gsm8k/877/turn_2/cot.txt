Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000 by selling the chickens.
- Isaias plans to sell the chickens at $50 per chicken.
- Isaias has 300 chickens on his farm.
- Isaias plans to sell 3/5 of the chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.
Total chickens = 300
Chickens to be sold = 3/5 of 300 = 180 chickens

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Isaias will make from selling the chickens.
Total revenue = Number of chickens sold × Price per chicken
Total revenue = 180 × $50 = $9,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost Isaias incurred to buy the chickens.
Total profit = $2,000
Total revenue = $9,000
Total cost = Total revenue - Total profit
Total cost = $9,000 - $2,000 = $7,000

Therefore,
