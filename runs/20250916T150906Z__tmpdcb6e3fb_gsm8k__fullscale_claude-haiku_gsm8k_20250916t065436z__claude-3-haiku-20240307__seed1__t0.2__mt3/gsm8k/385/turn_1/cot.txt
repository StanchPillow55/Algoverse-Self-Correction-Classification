Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The choir has 52 members total.
2. 50% of the choir members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   * So, the number of boys and girls are both 26 (52 * 0.5 = 26).
3. The choir decides to perform with just its female members.
   * So, the initial number of performers is 26 (the 26 girls).
4. On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it to the show.
   * So, the number of performers is now 13 (26 * 0.5 = 13).
5. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them.
   * So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is 16 (13 + 3 = 16).

Therefore, the final answer is 16 people sang in the performance.
