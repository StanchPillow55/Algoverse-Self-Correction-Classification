To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
2. Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
3. Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
4. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
* The choir has 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls.
* To find the number of girls, we can divide the total number of members by 2:
* 52 รท 2 = 26 girls

Step 2: Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
* On the day of the performance, half the people performing couldn't make it due to a bus breakdown.
* This means that half of the 26 girls were able to perform:
* 26 รท 2 = 13 girls

Step 3: Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
* The choir's 3 teachers decided to sing with them.
*
