Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Elise writes the full alphabet twice:
   * The alphabet has 26 letters
   * 26 letters x 2 times = 52 letters

2) Elise writes half of the alphabet once:
   * Half of the alphabet is 13 letters (26 / 2 = 13)
   * 13 letters

3) Elise re-writes everything she has already written:
   * This includes the 52 letters from the first two times, and the 13 letters from the third time
   * 52 letters + 13 letters = 65 letters

Adding up all the letters written:
* 52 letters (full alphabet twice)
* 13 letters (half alphabet once)
* 65 letters (re-writing everything)
* Total: 52 + 13 + 65 = 130 letters

Therefore, the total number of letters Elise has written is 130.
