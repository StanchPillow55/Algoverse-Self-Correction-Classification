To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Elise has written.

Given information:
- Elise writes the full alphabet twice.
- Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
- Elise re-writes everything she has already written.

Step 1: Calculate the number of letters in the full alphabet.
The full alphabet has 26 letters.

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters Elise writes in the first two full iterations of the alphabet.
Number of letters in the first two full iterations = 2 ร 26 = 52 letters

Step 3: Calculate the number of letters Elise writes in the half iteration of the alphabet.
Number of letters in the half iteration = 26 รท 2 = 13 letters

Step 4: Calculate the total number of letters Elise has written so far.
Total letters written so far = 52 + 13 = 65 letters

Step 5: Calculate the number of letters Elise writes when re-writing everything she has already written.
Number of letters re-written = 65 letters
