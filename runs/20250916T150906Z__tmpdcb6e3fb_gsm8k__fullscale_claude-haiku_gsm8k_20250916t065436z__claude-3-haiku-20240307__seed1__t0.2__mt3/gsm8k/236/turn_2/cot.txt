Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ram can save money by mixing the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 full pen.
- Ram buys 25 pens.

Step 1: Calculate how many full pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he bought.
Number of full pens made = 25 pens / 5 empty pens per full pen = 5 full pens

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pens Ram will have after making the new full pens.
Total pens = Original 25 pens + New 5 full pens = 25 + 5 = 30 pens

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram will have is 30 pens.

Final answer: Ram will have a total of 30 pens.
