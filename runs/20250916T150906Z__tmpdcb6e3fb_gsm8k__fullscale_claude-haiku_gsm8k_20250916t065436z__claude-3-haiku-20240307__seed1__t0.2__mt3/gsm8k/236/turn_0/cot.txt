Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ram can save money by mixing the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen.
- Ram buys 25 pens.

To find the total number of pens Ram gets to have, we need to calculate the number of new pens he can make from the 25 pens he bought.

Step 1: Calculate the number of new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he bought.
Number of new pens = Number of pens bought / Number of empty pens needed to make one new pen
Number of new pens = 25 / 5 = 5 new pens

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pens Ram gets to have.
Total number of pens = Number of pens bought + Number of new pens made
Total number of pens = 25 + 5 = 30 pens

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.

Final answer: Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.
