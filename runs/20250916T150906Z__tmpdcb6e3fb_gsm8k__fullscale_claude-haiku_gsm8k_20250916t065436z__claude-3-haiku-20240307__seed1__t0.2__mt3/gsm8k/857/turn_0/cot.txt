To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
2. Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
3. Add the amounts of water from all three days to get the total amount of water passing through the river.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
* On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river was 4000 gallons.
* On the second day, the amount of water passing through the river doubled, so it was 4000 gallons Ã— 2 = 8000 gallons.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
* On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increased by 6000 gallons.
* The amount of water passing through the river on the third day was 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water passing through the river.
* Total amount of water = Amount on first day
