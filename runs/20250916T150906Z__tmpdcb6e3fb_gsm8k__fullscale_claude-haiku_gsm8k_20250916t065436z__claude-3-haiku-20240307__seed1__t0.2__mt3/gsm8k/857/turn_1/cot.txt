Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is 4000 gallons.
- On the second day, after a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles.
- On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the second day.
Amount of water on the second day = 4000 gallons Ã— 2 = 8000 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water passing through the river on the third day.
Amount of water on the third day = Amount of water on the second day + 6000 gallons
Amount of water on the third day = 8000 gallons + 6000 gallons = 14000 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water passing through the river.
Total amount of water = Amount of water on the first day + Amount of water on the second day + Amount of water on the third day
Total amount of water
