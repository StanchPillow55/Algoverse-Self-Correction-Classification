Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Solomon bought 20 marbles from his friend Johanna.
- The store already had 50 marbles.
- Solomon's father gave him 2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
- Each marble weighs 2 kgs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of marbles Solomon's father gave him.
Number of marbles from father = 2/5 × 20 = 8 marbles

Step 2: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store.
Total marbles = Marbles from Johanna + Marbles already in the store + Marbles from father
Total marbles = 20 + 50 + 8 = 78 marbles

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the marbles.
Total weight = Total number of marbles × Weight of each marble
Total weight = 78 marbles × 2 kgs/marble = 156 kgs

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store
