Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The interior design firm offers installation for $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
- They will install additional items for an extra $15.00 per item.
- Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed/hung.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the basic installation package.
Basic installation package cost = $129.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional items Angela needs installed.
Additional items = (6 mirrors - 4 mirrors) + (2 chandeliers - 1 chandelier) + (20 pictures - 10 pictures) = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 items

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the additional items.
Cost of additional items = 13 items Ã— $15.00 per item = $195.00

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for Angela's installation.
Total cost = Basic installation package
