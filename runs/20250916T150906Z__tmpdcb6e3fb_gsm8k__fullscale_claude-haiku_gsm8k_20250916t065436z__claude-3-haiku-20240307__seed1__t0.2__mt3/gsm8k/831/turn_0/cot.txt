To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the total cost for Angela's installation.

Given information:
- The installation fee for the basic package is $129.00, which includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.
- The additional cost for each extra item is $15.00.
- Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures that she needs installed.

Step 1: Calculate the number of extra items Angela needs to have installed.
Extra mirrors = 6 - 4 = 2
Extra chandeliers = 2 - 1 = 1
Extra pictures = 20 - 10 = 10
Total extra items = 2 + 1 + 10 = 13

Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for the extra items.
Additional cost = 13 extra items Ã— $15.00 per item = $195.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for Angela's installation.
Total cost = Basic installation fee + Additional cost for extra items
Total cost =
