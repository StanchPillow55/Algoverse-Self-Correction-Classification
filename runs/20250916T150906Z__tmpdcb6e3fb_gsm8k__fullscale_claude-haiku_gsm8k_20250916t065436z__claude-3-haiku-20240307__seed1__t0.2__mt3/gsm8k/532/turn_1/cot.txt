Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.

Step 1: Find Jame's current age.
Jame will turn 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old.

Step 2: Find Jame's age in 8 years.
Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

Step 3: Find the cousin's age in 8 years.
The cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.
Twice Jame's age in 8 years = 2 Ã— 30 = 60 years old.
The cousin's age in 8 years = 60 - 5 = 55 years old.

Step 4: Find the cousin's current age.
The cousin's age in
