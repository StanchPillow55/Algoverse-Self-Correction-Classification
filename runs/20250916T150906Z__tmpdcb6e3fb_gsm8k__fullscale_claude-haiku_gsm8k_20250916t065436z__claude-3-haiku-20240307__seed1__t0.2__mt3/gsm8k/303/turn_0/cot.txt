To solve this problem, we need to find the number of books sold in each year and then calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year.

Given information:
- Elise has a collection of 250 books.
- Each book sells for $20.
- Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
- There are currently 50 unsold books.
- Elise's sales number this year is 45.

Step 1: Find the number of books sold in the current year.
Number of books sold in the current year = 45

Step 2: Find the number of books sold in the first year.
Since Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, the number of books sold in the first year is:
Number of books sold in the first year = 2 Ã— 45 = 90

Step 3: Find the number of books sold in the second year.
Total number of books = 250
Number of unsold books = 50
Number of books sold in the first year = 90
Number of books sold in
