Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Greta bakes 30 cookies.
2. Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.
3. The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.
4. Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.
5. The remaining cookies are put in a box.
6. The number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 80 cookies in the box.
