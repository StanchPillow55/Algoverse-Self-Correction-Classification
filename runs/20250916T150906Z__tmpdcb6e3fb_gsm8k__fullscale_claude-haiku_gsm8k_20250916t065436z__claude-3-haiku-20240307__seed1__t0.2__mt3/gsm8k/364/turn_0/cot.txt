To solve this problem, we need to find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.

Given information:
- There are 96 fourth-graders at Small Tree School.
- 43 of them are girls.
- On Friday, 5 fourth-grade girls and 4 fourth-grade boys were absent.

Step 1: Find the number of fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School.
Total number of fourth-graders = 96
Number of fourth-grade girls = 43
Number of fourth-grade boys = Total number of fourth-graders - Number of fourth-grade girls
Number of fourth-grade boys = 96 - 43 = 53

Step 2: Find the number of fourth-grade boys present at Small Tree School on Friday.
Number of fourth-grade boys absent on Friday = 4
Number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday = Number of fourth-grade boys - Number of fourth-grade boys absent
Number of fourth-grade boys present on Friday = 53 - 4 = 49

Therefore, on Friday, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School.
