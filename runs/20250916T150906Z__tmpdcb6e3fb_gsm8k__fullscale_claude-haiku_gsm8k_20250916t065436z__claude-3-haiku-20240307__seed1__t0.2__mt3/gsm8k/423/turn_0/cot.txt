To solve this problem, we need to find the original cost of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Find the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Let x be the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write:
x = $28 - $6 = $22

Step 2: Find the total savings.
Total savings = $28 + $22 - (Total cost of both jeans)
Total savings = $50 - (Total cost of both jeans)

Step 3: Find the total cost of both jeans.
Total cost of both jeans = Total savings + $6 (the amount saved)
Total cost of both
