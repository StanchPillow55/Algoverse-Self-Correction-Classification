Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Find the cost of the jogger jeans.
Cost of the jogger jeans = Cost of the tattered jeans - $6
Cost of the jogger jeans = $28 - $6 = $22

Step 2: Find the original cost of the jogger jeans before the sale.
Total savings = $6
Savings from the jogger jeans = 1/3 of the total savings = 1/3 × $6 = $2
Savings from the tattered jeans = 2/3 of the total savings = 2/3 × $6 = $4

Original cost of the jogger jeans = Cost of the jogger jeans + Savings from the jogger jeans
