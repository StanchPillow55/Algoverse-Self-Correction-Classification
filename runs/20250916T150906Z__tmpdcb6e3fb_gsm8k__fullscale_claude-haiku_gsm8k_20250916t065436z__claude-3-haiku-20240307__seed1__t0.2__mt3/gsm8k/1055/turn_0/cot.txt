Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The normal cost of the insurance is $120 per month.
- Due to an accident, the cost is 60% more than normal.

Step 1: Calculate the increased cost of the insurance.
Normal cost = $120 per month
Increase = 60% of $120 = 0.60 × $120 = $72
New cost = Normal cost + Increase = $120 + $72 = $192 per month

Step 2: Calculate the total cost per year.
Total cost per year = New cost per month × 12 months
Total cost per year = $192 × 12 = $2,304

Therefore, James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.

Final answer: James pays $2,304 per year for the insurance.
