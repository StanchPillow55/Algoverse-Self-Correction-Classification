Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread

To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of spools Candy has
2. Calculate the total number of blue spools
3. Divide the total number of blue spools by the total number of spools
4. Multiply by 100 to get the percentage

Step 1: Calculate the total number of spools Candy has
Total spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (dark blue) + 40 (light green) + 50 (dark green)
Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Step 2: Calculate the total number of blue spools
Total blue spools = 15 (light blue) + 45 (
