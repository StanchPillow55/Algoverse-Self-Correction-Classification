To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has and then calculate the percentage of blue spools.

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread.
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread.

Step 1: Find the total number of spools Candy has.
Total number of spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools + Light green spools + Dark green spools
Total number of spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

Step 2: Find the total number of blue spools.
Total number of blue spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools
Total number of blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 spools

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue spools.
Percentage of blue spools = (Total number of blue spools / Total number of spools) Ã— 100
Percentage of
