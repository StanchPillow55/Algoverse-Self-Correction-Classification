Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We need to find the total number of spools Candy has:
   * 15 light blue spools
   * 45 dark blue spools
   * 40 light green spools
   * 50 dark green spools
   * Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

2. Now we need to find the total number of blue spools:
   * Light blue spools: 15
   * Dark blue spools: 45
   * Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 spools

3. To find the percentage of blue spools, we divide the total blue spools by the total spools and multiply by 100:
   * Percentage of blue spools = (60 / 150) * 100 = 40%

Therefore, 40% of Candy's spools are blue.
