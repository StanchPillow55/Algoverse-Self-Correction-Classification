To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost that Patty's Plumbing charged for the job.

Given information:
- Patty's Plumbing charges $40 to visit a house to make a repair.
- Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour, or part thereof, for labor.
- The job took 2.25 hours.
- The job used $60 in parts.

Step 1: Calculate the labor cost.
Labor cost = $35 per hour Ã— 2.25 hours = $78.75

Step 2: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Visit charge + Labor cost + Parts cost
Total cost = $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75

Therefore, Patty's Plumbing charged $178.75 for the job.
