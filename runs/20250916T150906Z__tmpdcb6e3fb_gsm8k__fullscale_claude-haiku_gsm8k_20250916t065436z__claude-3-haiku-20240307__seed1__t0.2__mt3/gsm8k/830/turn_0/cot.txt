To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities in a month with four weeks.

Given information:
- Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week.
- She spends 2 hours a week writing amateur songs to sing on TikTok.
- She spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup before filming herself for TikTok.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent recording TikTok videos in a month.
Time spent recording TikTok videos per week = 18 videos × 4 minutes per video = 72 minutes per week
Time spent recording TikTok videos in a month = 72 minutes per week × 4 weeks = 288 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time spent writing amateur songs in a month.
Time spent writing songs per week = 2 hours = 120 minutes
Time spent writing songs in a month = 120 minutes per week × 4 weeks = 480 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time spent doing makeup before filming in a month.
