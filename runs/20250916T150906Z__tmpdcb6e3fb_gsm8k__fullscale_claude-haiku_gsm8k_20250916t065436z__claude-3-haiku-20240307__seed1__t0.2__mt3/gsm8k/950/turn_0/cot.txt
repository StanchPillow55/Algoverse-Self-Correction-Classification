To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points scored by Azibo.

Given information:
- The team scored a total of 45 points.
- Bahati scored the most points, which was 20 more than Azibo and 10 more than Dinar.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of points scored by Azibo.
- Let x + 10 be the number of points scored by Dinar.
- Let x + 20 be the number of points scored by Bahati.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total points scored.
Bahati's points + Azibo's points + Dinar's points = Total points
(x + 20) + x + (x + 10) = 45

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
3x + 30 = 45

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
3x + 30 = 45
3x = 15
x = 5

Therefore, Azibo scored 5 points.

Final answer: Azibo score
