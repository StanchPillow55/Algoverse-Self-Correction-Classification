Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys.
   * Total toys needed = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys

3. After buying the 8 new toys, there are now twice as many dogs as when he left.
   * If there were 4 dogs initially, and 8 more were added, that means there are now 12 dogs total.
   * Twice as many dogs as when he left means there are now 24 dogs.
   * So he needs to buy 12 more toys (24 dogs - 12 toys he already has).
   * Total toys needed = 12 (initial) + 12 (new) = 24 toys

4. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those 3 toys.
   * Total toys needed = 24 (previous) - 3 (no longer
