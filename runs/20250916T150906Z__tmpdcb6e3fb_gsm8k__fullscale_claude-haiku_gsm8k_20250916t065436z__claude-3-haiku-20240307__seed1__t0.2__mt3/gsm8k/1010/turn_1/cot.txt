Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

2. Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
   * Trey's laps = Bethany's laps + 4
   * Trey's laps = 10 + 4 = 14 laps

3. Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
   * Shaelyn's laps = Trey's laps / 2
   * Shaelyn's laps = 14 / 2 = 7 laps

4. Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   * Quinn's laps = Shaelyn's laps - 2
   * Quinn's laps = 7 - 2 = 5 laps

5. To find how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:
   * Bethany's laps - Quinn's laps = 10 - 5 = 5 laps

Therefore
