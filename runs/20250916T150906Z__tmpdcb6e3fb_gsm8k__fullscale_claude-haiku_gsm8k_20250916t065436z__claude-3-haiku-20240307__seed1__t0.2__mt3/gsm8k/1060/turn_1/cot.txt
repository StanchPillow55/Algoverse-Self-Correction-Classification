Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 pizzas, and each pizza has 8 slices.
- Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did.
- Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did.
- Becky ate 10 slices.

Step 1: Find out how many slices Jake ate.
Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, we can say:
Becky's slices = Jake's slices + 3
10 = Jake's slices + 3
Jake's slices = 7

Step 2: Find out how many slices Silvia ate.
Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so:
Silvia's slices = 2 × Jake's slices
Silvia's slices = 2 × 7 = 14

Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.
Total slices eaten = Becky's slices + Jake's slices + Silvia's slices
Total slices
