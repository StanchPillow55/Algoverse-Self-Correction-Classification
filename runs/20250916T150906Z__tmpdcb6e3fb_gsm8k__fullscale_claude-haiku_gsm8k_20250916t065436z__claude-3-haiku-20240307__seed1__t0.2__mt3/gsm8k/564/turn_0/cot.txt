To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks.

Given information:
- In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep.
- In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.
- Judy can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week.
Number of minutes read in the first week = 15 minutes per night × 7 nights = 105 minutes
Number of pages read in the first week = (105 minutes / 1.5 minutes per 2 pages) × 2 pages = 140 pages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks.
Total pages read in two weeks = Pages read in the first week + Pages read in the second week
Total pages read in two weeks = 140 pages + 100 pages = 240 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 240 pages in two weeks.
