Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company has a total of 100 employees.
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
- The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of junior programmers.
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 × 100 = 40 junior programmers

Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers.
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary of the junior programmers.
Monthly salary of junior programmers = 40 × $2000 = $80,000

Step 4: Calculate the monthly salary of the senior programmers.
Monthly salary of senior programmers = 60 × ($2000 + $
