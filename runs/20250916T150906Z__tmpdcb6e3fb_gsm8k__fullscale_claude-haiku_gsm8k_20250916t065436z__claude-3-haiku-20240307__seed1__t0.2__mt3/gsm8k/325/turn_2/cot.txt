Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The company has a total of 100 employees.
- Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers.
- The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees.
- Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of junior programmers.
Number of junior programmers = 2/5 Ã— 100 = 40 junior programmers

Step 2: Calculate the number of senior programmers.
Total number of employees = 100
Number of junior programmers = 40
Number of senior programmers = Total number of employees - Number of junior programmers
Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Step 3: Calculate the monthly salary of the senior programmers.
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = Monthly salary of a junior programmer + $400
Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400 = $2400

Step 4: Calculate the total monthly salary for all the programmers.
Total monthly
