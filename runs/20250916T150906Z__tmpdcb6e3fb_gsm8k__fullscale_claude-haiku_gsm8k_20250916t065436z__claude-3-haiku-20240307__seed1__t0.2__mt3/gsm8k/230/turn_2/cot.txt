Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars for his company.
2. Each car sells for $20,000.
3. He pays 10% tax on the cars.
4. He pays an additional $1,000 for registration on each car.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 12 cars before tax and registration:
* 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000

Next, let's calculate the 10% tax on the $240,000:
* 10% of $240,000 = $24,000

Now, let's calculate the total registration fees for the 12 cars:
* 12 cars x $1,000 per car = $12,000

Finally, we can add up the total cost:
* Cost of cars: $240,000
* Tax: $24,000
* Registration fees: $12,000
* Total: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for
