Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars
- Each car sells for $20,000
- He pays 10% tax on the cars
- He pays $1,000 for registration on each car

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.
Total cost of cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
Total cost of cars = 12 × $20,000 = $240,000

Step 2: Calculate the tax amount.
Tax amount = Total cost of cars × Tax rate
Tax amount = $240,000 × 0.10 = $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the total registration cost.
Total registration cost = Number of cars × Registration cost per car
Total registration cost = 12 × $1,000 = $12,000

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mark pays for everything.
Total amount paid = Total cost of cars + Tax amount + Total registration cost
Total amount paid = $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,
