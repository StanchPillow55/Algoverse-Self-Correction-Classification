Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- You paid $40 for a foot-long fish sub.
- You paid thrice as much for a 6-inch cold-cut combo sub.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 6-inch cold-cut combo sub.
Cost of 6-inch cold-cut combo sub = 3 Ã— $40 = $120

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the lunch.
Total cost = Cost of foot-long fish sub + Cost of 6-inch cold-cut combo sub
Total cost = $40 + $120 = $160

Therefore, the total cost for your lunch today at Subway is $160.
