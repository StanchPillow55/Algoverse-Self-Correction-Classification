Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
- Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
- Sarah plans to use the profit to buy a new rope, which costs $1.5 per meter.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sarah will receive from selling the 20-meter rope.
Total amount received = Length of rope × Price per meter
Total amount received = 20 meters × $2 per meter = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new rope that Sarah wants to buy.
Cost of new rope = Length of new rope × Price per meter
Cost of new rope = 20 meters × $1.5 per meter = $30

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.
Money left over = Total amount received - Cost of new rope
Money left over = $40 - $30 = $10

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.
