Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Step 1: Let's represent the number of books each person has.
Let x = the number of books Anne has.
Then, Sofie has x + 25 books, and Fawn has x + 12 books.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of books.
Total books = Sofie's books + Anne's books + Fawn's books
85 = (x + 25) + x + (x + 12)
85 = 3x + 37

Step 3: Solve for x, the number of books Anne has.
3x + 37 = 85
3x = 48
x = 16

Step 4: Find the number of books Fawn has.
Fawn has x + 12 books
Fawn has 16
