Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes Jim 4 years to finish college.
- He gets $50,000 in loans per year.
- He had a $25,000 per year job before college.
- His college degree tripled his income.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out.
Total loans = $50,000 per year × 4 years = $200,000

Step 2: Calculate the income he lost by not working for 4 years.
Income lost = $25,000 per year × 4 years = $100,000

Step 3: Calculate his new income after college.
New income = $25,000 per year × 3 = $75,000 per year

Step 4: Calculate how long it will take to earn the equivalent of the loans and lost income.
Total amount to earn = Loans + Income lost = $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000
Time to earn the equivalent = $300,000 / $75,000 per year = 4
