To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out during college.
2. Calculate the difference in income before and after college.
3. Determine how long it will take Jim to earn the equivalent of the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out during college.
* Jim took out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.
* Total loans = $50,000 x 4 = $200,000

Step 2: Calculate the difference in income before and after college.
* Before college, Jim had a $25,000 per year job.
* After college, his income tripled, so his new income is $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year.
* Difference in income = $75,000 - $25,000 = $50,000 per year.

Step 3: Determine how long it will take Jim to earn the equivalent of the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
* Money lost from not working while
