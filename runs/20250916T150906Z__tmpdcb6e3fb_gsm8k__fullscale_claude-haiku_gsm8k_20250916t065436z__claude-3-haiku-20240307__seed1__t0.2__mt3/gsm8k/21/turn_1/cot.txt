Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
- Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
- Samantha is now 31 years old.

Step 1: Find Raymond's current age.
Samantha's current age = 31 years
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha
Raymond's current age = Samantha's current age - 6 years
Raymond's current age = 31 - 6 = 25 years

Step 2: Find the age of Raymond's son.
Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
Age of Raymond's son = Raymond's current age - 23 years
Age of Raymond's son = 25 - 23 = 2 years

Step 3: Find how many years ago Raymond's son was born.
Raymond's son is currently 2 years old.
Years ago Raymond's son was born = Current age of Raymond's son
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 2 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 2 years
