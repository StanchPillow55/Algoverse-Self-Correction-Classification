To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond's son and then calculate how many years ago he was born.

Given information:
- Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
- Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
- Samantha is now 31 years old.

Step 1: Find Raymond's age.
Samantha's current age = 31 years
Raymond's age = Samantha's age + 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 + 6 = 37 years

Step 2: Find the age of Raymond's son.
Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
Age of Raymond's son = 37 - 23 = 14 years

Step 3: Calculate how many years ago Raymond's son was born.
Samantha's current age = 31 years
Age of Raymond's son = 14 years
Years ago Raymond's son was born = Samantha's current age - Age of Raymond's son
Years ago Raymond's son was born = 31 - 14 = 17 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was
