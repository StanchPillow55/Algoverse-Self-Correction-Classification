Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The file size is 200 GB.
- Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
- 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
- Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

Step 1: Calculate how much of the file was downloaded before the restart.
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 Ã— 200 GB = 80 GB

Step 2: Calculate how long it took to download the 80 GB before the restart.
Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the remaining file size to be downloaded after the restart.
Remaining file size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to download the remaining 120 GB.
Time taken to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60
