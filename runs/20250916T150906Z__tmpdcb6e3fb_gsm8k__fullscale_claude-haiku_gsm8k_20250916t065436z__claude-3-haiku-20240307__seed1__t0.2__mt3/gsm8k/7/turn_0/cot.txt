To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the file, considering the interruption caused by the Windows update.

Given information:
- The file size is 200 GB.
- Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
- The Windows update takes 20 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 Ã— 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to restart the download from the beginning.
Time to download the remaining 60% of the file = (200 GB - 80 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 60 GB / 2 GB/minute = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time to download the file, including the interruption.
Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update + Time to download the remaining 60%
Total time = 40 minutes +
