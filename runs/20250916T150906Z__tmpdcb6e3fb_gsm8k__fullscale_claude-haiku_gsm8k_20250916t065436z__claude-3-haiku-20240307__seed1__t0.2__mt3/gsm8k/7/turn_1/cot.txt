Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
2. Normally, she can download 2 GB/minute.
3. 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
4. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

Let's calculate the time it takes to download the file:

* Initial download speed: 2 GB/minute
* 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
* Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Then, the Windows update takes 20 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the full 200 GB file again.
* Time to download 200 GB = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Total time:
* Initial download: 40 minutes
* Windows update: 20 minutes
* Restart download: 100 minutes
