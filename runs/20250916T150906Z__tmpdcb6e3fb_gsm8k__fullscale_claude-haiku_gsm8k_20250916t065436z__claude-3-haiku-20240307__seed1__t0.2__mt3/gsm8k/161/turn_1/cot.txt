Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Anakin caught:
  - 10 starfish
  - 6 sea horses
  - 3 clownfish
- Locsin caught:
  - 5 fewer starfish than Anakin
  - 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin
  - 2 more clownfish than Anakin

Step 1: Calculate the number of starfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 10 starfish, and Locsin caught 5 fewer.
Locsin's starfish = 10 - 5 = 5 starfish

Step 2: Calculate the number of sea horses Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 6 sea horses, and Locsin caught 3 fewer.
Locsin's sea horses = 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses 

Step 3: Calculate the number of clownfish Locsin caught.
Anakin caught 3 clownfish, and Locsin caught 2 more.
