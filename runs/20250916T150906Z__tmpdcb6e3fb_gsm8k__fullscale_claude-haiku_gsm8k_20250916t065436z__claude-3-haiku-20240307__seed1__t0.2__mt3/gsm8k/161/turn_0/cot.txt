To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin.

Given information:
- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish caught by Anakin.
Anakin's catch:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3
Total fish caught by Anakin = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish

Step 2: Calculate the number of fish caught by Locsin.
Locsin's catch:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5
Total fish caught by Locsin = 5 + 3 +
