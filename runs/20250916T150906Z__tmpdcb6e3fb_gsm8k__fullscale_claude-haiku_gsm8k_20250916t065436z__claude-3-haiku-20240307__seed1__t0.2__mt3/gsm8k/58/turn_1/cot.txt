Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Stephen's final bill came to $40.00
- The delivery vendor tacked on a 25% fee to the final total
- The delivery vendor charged $3.00 in delivery fees
- Stephen added a $4.00 tip

Step 1: Calculate the 25% fee on the $40.00 final bill.
25% of $40.00 = 0.25 Ã— $40.00 = $10.00

Step 2: Calculate the total amount before the tip.
Final bill ($40.00) + 25% fee ($10.00) + Delivery fee ($3.00) = $53.00

Step 3: Calculate the final price including the tip.
Total amount before tip ($53.00) + Tip ($4.00) = $57.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries, including all the extra fees and the tip, is $57.00.
