To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final bill to find the original cost of the groceries.

Given information:
- The final bill came to $40.00.
- There was a 25% fee added to the final total.
- There was a $3.00 delivery fee.
- Stephen added a $4.00 tip.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount added to the original cost of the groceries.
Total added amount = 25% fee + Delivery fee + Tip
Total added amount = (0.25 Ã— $40.00) + $3.00 + $4.00
Total added amount = $10.00 + $3.00 + $4.00 = $17.00

Step 2: Calculate the original cost of the groceries.
Original cost of groceries = Final bill - Total added amount
Original cost of groceries = $40.00 - $17.00 = $23.00

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $23.00.
