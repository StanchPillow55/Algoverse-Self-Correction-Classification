Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens 3 cups of mixed feed per day.
- She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals.
- In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, she gives her flock 25 cups of feed.

To find the amount of feed needed for the final meal, we need to:
1. Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day.
2. Subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day.
Total feed needed per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
Total feed needed per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal.
Feed needed for final meal = Total feed needed per day - Feed given in morning - Feed given in afternoon
Feed needed for final meal = 60 cups - 15 cups - 25
