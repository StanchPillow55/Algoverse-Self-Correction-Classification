To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of feed required for the flock of 20 chickens and then subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Given information:
- Each chicken is fed 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per day.
- In the morning, Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives her flock 25 cups of feed.
- The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed required for the flock per day.
Total feed required per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
Total feed required per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal of the day.
Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed required per day - Total
