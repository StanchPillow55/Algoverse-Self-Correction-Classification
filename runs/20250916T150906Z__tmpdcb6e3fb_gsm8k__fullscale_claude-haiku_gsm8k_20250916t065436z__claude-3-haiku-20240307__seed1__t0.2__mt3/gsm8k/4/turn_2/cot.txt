Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each chicken is fed 3 cups of mixed feed per day
- Wendi's flock has 20 chickens
- In the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives her chickens 25 cups of feed

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the day.
Total feed needed per day = Number of chickens × Feed per chicken per day
Total feed needed per day = 20 chickens × 3 cups per chicken = 60 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon.
Feed given in the morning = 15 cups
Feed given in the afternoon = 25 cups
Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups

Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal.
Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed needed per day - Total feed given in the morning and afternoon
Feed needed for the final meal = 60 cups -
