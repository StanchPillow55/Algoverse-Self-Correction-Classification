Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There are 27 unicorns left in the world.

2. One third of them are in the Scottish Highlands.
   * To find one third of 27, we divide 27 by 3:
   * 27 รท 3 = 9
   * So there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

3. Two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female.
   * To find two thirds of 9, we multiply 9 by 2 and then divide by 3:
   * 9 x 2 = 18
   * 18 รท 3 = 6
   * So there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

Final answer: There are 6 female Scottish unicorns.
