Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lillian builds 3 bird feeders and buys 3 others.
- The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each throughout the day.
- The homemade feeders attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders.
Number of store-bought feeders = 3
Birds attracted to each store-bought feeder = 20
Total birds attracted to store-bought feeders = 3 × 20 = 60 birds

Step 2: Calculate the number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders.
Number of homemade feeders = 3
Birds attracted to each homemade feeder = 20 + 10 = 30
Total birds attracted to homemade feeders = 3 × 30 = 90 birds

Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day.
Total birds attracted to all feeders = Birds attracted to store-
