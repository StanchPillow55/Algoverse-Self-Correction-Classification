Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. So, the number of video games Brian has is 20 - 5 = 15.

2. The question states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian. 
   * This means that Bobby's video games = (3 x Brian's video games) - 5
   * Plugging in the value for Brian's video games, we get:
   * Bobby's video games = (3 x 15) - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is that Bobby has 40 video games.
