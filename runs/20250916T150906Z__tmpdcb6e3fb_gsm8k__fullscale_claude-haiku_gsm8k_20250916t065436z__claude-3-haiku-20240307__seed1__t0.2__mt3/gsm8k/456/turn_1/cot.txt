Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 15 red cards in the set of magician's cards.
- The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
- The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green cards.
Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.6 Ã— 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards of all mentioned colors.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number
