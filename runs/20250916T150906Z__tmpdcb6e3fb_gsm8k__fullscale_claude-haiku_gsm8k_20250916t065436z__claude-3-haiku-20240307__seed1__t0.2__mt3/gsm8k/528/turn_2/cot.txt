Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.

Step 1: Find the number of chairs Ophelia has.
Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can say:
Ophelia's chairs = Ophelia's sofas + 2
Ophelia's chairs = 20 + 2 = 22 chairs

Step 2: Find the number of chairs Jenna has.
Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so:
Jenna's chairs = 3 × Ophelia's chairs
Jenna's chairs = 3 × 22 = 66 chairs

Step 3: Find the number of sofas Jenna has.
Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can say:
Jenna's sofas = Jenna's chairs -
