Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th.
- Today is December 31st.
- Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days between December 31st and July 19th.
Number of days = July 19th - December 31st = 200 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.
Calories needed to lose 1 lb. = 3500 calories
Calories needed to lose 30 lbs. = 30 Ã— 3500 = 105,000 calories

Step 3: Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed to reach the goal.
Daily calorie deficit = Total calories needed / Number of days
Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories

Therefore, to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of 525
