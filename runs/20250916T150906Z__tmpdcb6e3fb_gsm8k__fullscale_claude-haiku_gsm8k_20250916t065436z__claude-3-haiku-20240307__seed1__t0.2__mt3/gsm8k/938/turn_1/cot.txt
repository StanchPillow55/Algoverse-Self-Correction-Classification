Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John earned $50 per hour and worked 6 hours in the week.
   * Total earnings = $50 x 6 hours = $300

2. John spent $50 on gas.
   * Remaining money = $300 - $50 = $250

3. John wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   * Remaining money after deposit = $250 - $100 = $150

4. John bought 5 pencils that cost $10 each.
   * Cost of pencils = 5 x $10 = $50
   * Remaining money = $150 - $50 = $100

5. Now, John wants to buy 25 dollar pens.
   * Remaining money = $100
   * Number of 25 dollar pens he can buy = $100 / $25 = 4 pens

Therefore, the final answer is that John can buy 4 pens after buying 5 pencils.
