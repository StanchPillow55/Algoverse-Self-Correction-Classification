Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James' home is 4 miles from the store.
- James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance James walked.
Total distance = Distance to the store + Distance back home
Total distance = 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it took James to reach the store.
Time = Total distance / Walking speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.

Final answer: It took James 2 hours to reach the store.
