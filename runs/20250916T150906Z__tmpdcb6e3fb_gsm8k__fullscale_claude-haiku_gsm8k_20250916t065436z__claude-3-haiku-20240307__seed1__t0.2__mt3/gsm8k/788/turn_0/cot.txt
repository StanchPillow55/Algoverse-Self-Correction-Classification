To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money John is missing for the school trip.

Given information:
- The total cost of the school trip is $300.
- The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.
- John has $50.

Step 1: Calculate the amount the school will cover.
Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = 1/2 Ã— $300 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the amount John needs to contribute.
John's contribution = Total cost of the trip - School's contribution
John's contribution = $300 - $150 = $150

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money John is missing.
Amount of money John is missing = John's contribution - John's current funds
Amount of money John is missing = $150 - $50 = $100

Therefore, John is missing $100 for the school trip.

Final answer: John is missing $100 for the school trip.
