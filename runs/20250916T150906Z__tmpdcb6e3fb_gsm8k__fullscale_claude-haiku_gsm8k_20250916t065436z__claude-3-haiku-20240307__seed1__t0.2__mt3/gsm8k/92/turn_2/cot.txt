Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emily has 4 kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
- James is 10 years old.
- James is 1 year younger than Corey.

Step 1: Find Corey's age.
Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old, we can calculate Corey's age:

Amy's age = Corey's age - 2
Amy's age = 11 - 2 = 9 years old

Step 3: Find Jackson's age.
Since Amy is 5 years
