Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Josh starts off practicing juggling 3 balls.
- He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week.
- After 4 weeks, the talent show begins.
- When Josh walks on stage, he drops 3 balls.
- 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd.
