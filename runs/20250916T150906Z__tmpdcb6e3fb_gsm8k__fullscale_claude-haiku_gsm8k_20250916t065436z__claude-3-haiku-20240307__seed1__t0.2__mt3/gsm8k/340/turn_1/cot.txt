Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Josh starts off practicing juggling 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 more ball to his juggling act.
   * Week 1: 3 balls
   * Week 2: 4 balls
   * Week 3: 5 balls
   * Week 4: 6 balls

3. At the end of the fourth week, the talent show begins.
4. When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.
5. 2 of the dropped balls are caught by people in the crowd as they roll off the stage.
6. 1 ball gets lost completely since the auditorium is dark.

So, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle on stage is:
* Total balls before dropping: 6
* Balls dropped: 3
* Balls caught by the crowd: 2
* Balls lost: 1

Therefore, the final number of balls Josh has to juggle on stage is:
* 6 - 3 + 2 = 5
