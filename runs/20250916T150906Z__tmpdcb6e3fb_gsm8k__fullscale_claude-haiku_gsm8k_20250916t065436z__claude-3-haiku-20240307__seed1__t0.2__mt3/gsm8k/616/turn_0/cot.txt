Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
- In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height.
- In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the beanstalk after the second week.
Height after the first week = 3 inches
Height after the second week = 3 inches Ã— 2 = 6 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the beanstalk after the third week.
Height after the second week = 6 inches
Height after the third week = 6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.

Final answer: The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.
