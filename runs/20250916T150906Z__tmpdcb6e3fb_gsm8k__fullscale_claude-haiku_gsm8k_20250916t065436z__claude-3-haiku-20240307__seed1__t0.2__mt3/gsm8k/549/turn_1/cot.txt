Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has.

Step 1: Determine the size of the play set that Jonathan needs to create.
Since Jonathan's play set needs to be five times larger than James's play set, we can calculate the size of Jonathan's play set as follows:
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 Ã— 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Determine how many more toys Jonathan needs to have in order to create the play set.
Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so the total number of toys he needs is:
Total toys needed = 400 + 2 = 402 toys

Step 3: Determine how many toys Jonathan currently has.
Since Jonathan needs 402 toys in total, and he needs 2 more toys than he already has, we can calculate the number
