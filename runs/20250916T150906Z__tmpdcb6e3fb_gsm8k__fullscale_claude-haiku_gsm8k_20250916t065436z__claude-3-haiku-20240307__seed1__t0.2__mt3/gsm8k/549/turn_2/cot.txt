Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the size of the play set that Jonathan needs to make.
Size of James's play set = 80 toys
Size of Jonathan's play set needs to be 5 times larger than James's play set.
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 Ã— 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs to have in total.
Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys for the play set.
Total toys Jonathan needs = 400 + 2 = 402 toys

Step 3: Calculate the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
Total toys Jonathan needs = 402 toys
We know that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has, so:
Jonathan's current number of toys
