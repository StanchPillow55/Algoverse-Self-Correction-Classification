To solve this problem, we need to find the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

Step 1: Find the number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set.
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × Size of James's play set
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Find the number of toys Jonathan needs to add to his current collection.
Number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set = 400 toys
Number of toys Jonathan currently has = x
Number of toys Jonathan needs to add = 400 - x + 2

Step 3: Set up an equation to solve for the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
Number of toys Jonathan needs to add = 2
400 - x + 2 = 2
400 - x = 0
x = 400

Therefore, Jonathan currently has 400 toys.

Final answer: Jonathan currently has 400
