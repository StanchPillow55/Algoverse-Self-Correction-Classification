Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   * Let's call the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as 'x'.
   * Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   * Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'y'.
   * Then, the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50y.
   * We know that Brittany's phone can hold 'x' photographs, so 50y = x.
   * Solving for 'x', we get x = 50y.

3. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   * We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   * So,
