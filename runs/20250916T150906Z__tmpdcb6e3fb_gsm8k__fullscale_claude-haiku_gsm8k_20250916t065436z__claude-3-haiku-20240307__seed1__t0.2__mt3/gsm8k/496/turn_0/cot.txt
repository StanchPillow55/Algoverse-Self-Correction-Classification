Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brett is 14 years old.
- In four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now.

Step 1: Determine Brett's age in four years.
Brett's age in four years = 14 + 4 = 18 years old

Step 2: Determine Angela's age in four years.
Angela's age in four years = 3 × Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 × 14 = 42 years old

Step 3: Determine Angela's current age.
Angela's current age = Angela's age in four years - 4 years
Angela's current age = 42 - 4 = 38 years old

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.
