Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Johnny has a Lego boxed set with 500 pieces.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the second set = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the third Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the third set = 1/4 × 500 = 125 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up.
Total number of Lego pieces = 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2,125 Lego pieces.

Final answer: Johnny picks up 2,125
