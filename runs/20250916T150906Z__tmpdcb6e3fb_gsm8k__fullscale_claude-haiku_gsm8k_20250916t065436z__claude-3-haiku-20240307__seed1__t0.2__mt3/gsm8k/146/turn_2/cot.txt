Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first lego boxed set has 500 pieces.

2. The second lego boxed set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. 
   * 3 x 500 = 1,500 pieces

3. The third lego boxed set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one.
   * 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces

4. To find the total number of pieces, we add up the pieces from all three sets:
   * 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, the total number of lego pieces that Johnny picks up is 2,125.
