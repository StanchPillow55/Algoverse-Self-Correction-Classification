Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculating the cost of the shorts:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts
   * Each pair of shorts costs $16.50
   * Total cost of the shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

2. Calculating the cost of the pants:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants
   * Each pair of pants costs $22.50
   * Total cost of the pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

3. Calculating the cost of the shoes:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes
   * Each pair of shoes costs $42
   * Total cost of the shoes = 3 × $42 = $126

4. Calculating the total amount Mishka spent:
   * Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
   * Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is $243
