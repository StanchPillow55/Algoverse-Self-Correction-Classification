To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later to get the total salary.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
Let's represent Lylah's salary as x.
Adrien's salary = 1.3x (30% higher than Lylah's)
We know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
Therefore, 1.3x = $40,000
x = $40,000 / 1.3
x = $30,769.23

Therefore, Lylah's salary four years ago was $30,769.23.

Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Adrien's salary four years later increased by 40% compared to four years ago
