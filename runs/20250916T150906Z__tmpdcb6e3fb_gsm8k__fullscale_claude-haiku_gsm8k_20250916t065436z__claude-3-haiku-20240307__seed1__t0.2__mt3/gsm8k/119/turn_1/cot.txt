Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.
- Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago.
- Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously.
- Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

Step 1: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000

Step 2: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can use the following equation:
Adrien's salary = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
$40,000 = 1.3 × Lylah's salary
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40,000 / 1.3 = $30,769.23

Step 3: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
