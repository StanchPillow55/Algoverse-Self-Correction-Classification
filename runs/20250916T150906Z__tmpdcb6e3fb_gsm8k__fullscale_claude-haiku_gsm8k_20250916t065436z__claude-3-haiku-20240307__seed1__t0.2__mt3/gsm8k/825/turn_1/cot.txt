Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There is a total of 341 cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of cards PJ has.
- Then, Smendrick has 3x cards.
- And Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of cards Becca has.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can write:
x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Simplifying the equation:
7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides:
7x = 329

Dividing both sides by 7:
x = 47

So, PJ has 47 cards.

Now, we can find the number of cards Smendrick has:
Smendrick has 3
