To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards that Becca has.

Given information:
- The total number of cards is 341.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of cards that PJ has.
- Then, Smendrick has 3x cards.
- Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Step 1: Find the total number of cards.
Total cards = Becca's cards + Smendrick's cards + PJ's cards
341 = (3x + 12) + 3x + x
341 = 7x + 12

Step 2: Solve for x (the number of cards that PJ has).
7x + 12 = 341
7x = 329
x = 47

Step 3: Find the number of cards that Smendrick has.
Smendrick's cards = 3x = 3 Ã— 47
