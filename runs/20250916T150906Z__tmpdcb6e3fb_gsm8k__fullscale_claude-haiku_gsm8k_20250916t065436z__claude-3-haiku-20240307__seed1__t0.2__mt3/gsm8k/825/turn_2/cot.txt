Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There is a total of 341 cards.
- Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of cards PJ has.
- Then, Smendrick has 3x cards.
- And Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of cards Becca has.

Step 1: Find the total number of cards.
Total cards = Becca's cards + Smendrick's cards + PJ's cards
341 = (3x + 12) + 3x + x
341 = 7x + 12

Step 2: Solve for x.
341 = 7x + 12
329 = 7x
x = 47

Step 3: Find the number of cards Becca has.
Becca's cards = 3x +
