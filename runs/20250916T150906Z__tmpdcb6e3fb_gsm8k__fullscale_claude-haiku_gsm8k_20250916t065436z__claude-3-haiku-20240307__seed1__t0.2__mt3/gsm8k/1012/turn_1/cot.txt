Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Maria's power bank was not fully charged when she left for the park.
2. At the park, her friends asked to charge their phones, and the power bank started losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours.
3. After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
4. In the end, the charge remaining was 28%.

Let's calculate the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

First, let's calculate the charge lost in the first 5 hours:
* 9% loss per hour for 5 hours = 45% total loss

Now, let's calculate the charge lost in the next 3 hours:
* 7% loss per hour for 3 hours = 21% total loss

The total charge lost is 45% + 21% = 66%.

We know the final charge remaining was 28%, so the initial charge must have been:
* 28% + 66% = 94%

Therefore, the charge of
