To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final charge of the power bank to find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.

Given information:
- The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
- After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
- The final charge remaining was 28%.

Step 1: Calculate the charge remaining after the first 5 hours.
Initial charge = 100%
Charge remaining after 5 hours = 100% - (9% × 5 hours) = 55%

Step 2: Calculate the charge remaining after the next 3 hours.
Charge remaining after 5 hours = 55%
Charge remaining after 3 more hours = 55% - (7% × 3 hours) = 28%

Step 3: Find the initial charge when Maria went out to the park.
Final charge remaining = 28%
We know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so we can work backward to find the initial charge.
