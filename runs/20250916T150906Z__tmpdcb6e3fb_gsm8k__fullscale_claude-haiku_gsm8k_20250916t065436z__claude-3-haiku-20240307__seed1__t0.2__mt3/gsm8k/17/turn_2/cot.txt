Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jill gets paid $20 per hour as a teacher
- Jill gets paid $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach
- Jill works 50 weeks a year
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a cheerleading coach

Step 1: Calculate Jill's annual earnings as a teacher.
Earnings as a teacher = Hourly rate × Hours worked per week × Weeks worked per year
Earnings as a teacher = $20 × 35 hours × 50 weeks = $35,000

Step 2: Calculate Jill's annual earnings as a cheerleading coach.
Earnings as a coach = Hourly rate × Hours worked per week × Weeks worked per year
Earnings as a coach = $30 × 15 hours × 50 weeks = $22,500
