Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach.
- Jill gets paid $30 per hour to be a cheerleading coach.
- Jill works 50 weeks a year.
- Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher.
- Jill works 15 hours per week as a coach.

Step 1: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a teacher.
Hourly rate as a teacher = $20
Hours worked per week as a teacher = 35 hours
Weeks worked per year = 50 weeks
Annual salary as a teacher = $20 × 35 hours × 50 weeks = $35,000

Step 2: Calculate Jill's annual salary as a cheerleading coach.
Hourly rate as a coach = $30
Hours worked per week as a coach = 15 hours
Weeks worked per year = 50 weeks
Annual salary as a coach = $30 × 15 hours × 50 weeks = $22,500
