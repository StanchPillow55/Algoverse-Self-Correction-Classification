Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We know that the orchard sells apples in bags of 10.
2. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples in one day.
3. To find the number of bags sold, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   * 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

4. We also know that the price per bag is $5.
5. To find the total amount earned, we need to multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag:
   * 200 bags x $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples in one day.
