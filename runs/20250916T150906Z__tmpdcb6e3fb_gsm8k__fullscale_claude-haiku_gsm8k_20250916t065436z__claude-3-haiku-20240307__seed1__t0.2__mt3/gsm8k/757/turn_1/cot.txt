Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Extra-small shirts: 
   * 11 students need extra-small shirts

2. Small shirts:
   * Twice as many students need small as extra-small
   * 11 x 2 = 22 students need small shirts

3. Medium shirts:
   * Four less than the number of small students need medium
   * 22 - 4 = 18 students need medium shirts

4. Large shirts:
   * Half as many students need large as medium
   * 18 / 2 = 9 students need large shirts

5. Extra-large shirts:
   * Six more students need extra-large than large
   * 9 + 6 = 15 students need extra-large shirts

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts Krissa ordered:
* Extra-small: 11
* Small: 22
* Medium: 18
* Large: 9
* Extra-large: 15

Total number of shirts ordered: 11 + 22 + 18 +
