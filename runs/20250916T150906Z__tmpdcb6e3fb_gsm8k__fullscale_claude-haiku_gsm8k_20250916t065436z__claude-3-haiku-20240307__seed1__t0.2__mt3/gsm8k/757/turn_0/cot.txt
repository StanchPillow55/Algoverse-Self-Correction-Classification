To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shirts needed for each size and then add them up to get the total number of shirts ordered.

Given information:
- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large.

Step 1: Find the number of size small shirts needed.
Number of size small shirts = 2 ร 11 = 22

Step 2: Find the number of size medium shirts needed.
Number of size medium shirts = 22 - 4 = 18

Step 3: Find the number of size large shirts needed.
Number of size large shirts = 18 รท 2 = 9

Step 4: Find the number of size extra-large shirts needed.
Number of size extra-large shirts = 9 + 6 = 15

Step 5: Find the total number of shirts ordered.
Total number of shirts = 11
