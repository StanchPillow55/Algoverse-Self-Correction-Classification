Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- John had a son James when he was 19 years old.
- James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
- Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
- John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.

Step 1: Find James's current age.
Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
James is twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is 2 Ã— 9 = 18 years old.

Step 2: Find John's age when James was born.
John was 19 years old when James was born.

Step 3: Find John's age when his youngest son was born.
John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.

Step 4: Find the age of John's youngest son in 3 years.
John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
