Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John had a son James when he was 19 years old.
- James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
- Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
- John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.

Step 1: Find Dora's current age.
Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

John was 19 years old when James was born.

Step 4: Find John's age when his youngest son was born.
John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
