Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James gets 80 emails a day.
2. 20% of those emails don't require any response.
   * To find 20% of 80 emails:
   * 20% of 80 = 0.20 x 80 = 16 emails
   * So, 16 emails per day don't require a response.
3. He responds to the rest of the emails.
   * Total emails per day = 80
   * Emails that don't require a response = 16
   * Emails he responds to = 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.
4. He works a 5 day work week.
   * Emails responded to in 5 days = 64 emails/day x 5 days = 320 emails.

Therefore, the final answer is:
James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week.
