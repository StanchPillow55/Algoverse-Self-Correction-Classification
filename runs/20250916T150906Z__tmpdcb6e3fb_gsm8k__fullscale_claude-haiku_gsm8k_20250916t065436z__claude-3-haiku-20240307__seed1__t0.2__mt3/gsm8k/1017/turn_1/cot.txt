Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.
- She put the same number of pictures into 8 albums.
- 3 of the albums were selfies only.
- 2 of the albums were portraits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pictures in each album.
Total number of pictures / Number of albums = Number of pictures in each album
72 pictures / 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Step 2: Calculate the number of selfie pictures.
Number of selfie albums × Number of pictures per album = Total number of selfie pictures
3 albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfie pictures

Step 3: Calculate the number of portrait pictures.
Number of portrait albums × Number of pictures per album = Total number of portrait pictures
2 albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portrait pictures

Therefore, the total number of portraits and selfies Olivia had is:
Portraits: 18
Selfies: 27
Total: 18 + 27 = 45 portraits
