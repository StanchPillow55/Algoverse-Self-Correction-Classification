Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day from her parents.
- She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day.
- She saves the change in her piggy bank.
- She saves for 5 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lollipops Marisa buys each day.
Cost of 4 lollipops = 4 × $0.25 = $1.00

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Marisa has left after buying the lollipops each day.
Amount of money left each day = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank over 5 days.
Total amount saved = $4.00 × 5 days = $20.00

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.
