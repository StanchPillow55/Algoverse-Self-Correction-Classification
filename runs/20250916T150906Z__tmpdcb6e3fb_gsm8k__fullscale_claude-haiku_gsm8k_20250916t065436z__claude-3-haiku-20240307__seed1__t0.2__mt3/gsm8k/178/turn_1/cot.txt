Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find how many crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
So, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.

Step 2: Find how many crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Monic has 36 crabs.
So, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 crabs

Therefore, the total number of crabs the three have
