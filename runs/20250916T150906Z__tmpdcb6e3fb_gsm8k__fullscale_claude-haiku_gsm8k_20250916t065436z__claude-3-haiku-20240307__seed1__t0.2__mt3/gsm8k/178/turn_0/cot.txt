Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find the number of crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Step 2: Find the number of crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10 = 46 crabs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 +
