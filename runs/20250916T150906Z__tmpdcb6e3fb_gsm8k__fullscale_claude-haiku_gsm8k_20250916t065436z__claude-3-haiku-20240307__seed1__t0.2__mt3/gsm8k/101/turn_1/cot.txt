Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Solo has to read 4 pages from his Science textbook.
- Solo has to read 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook.
- Solo has to read 7 pages from his History textbook.
- Solo has to read 8 pages from his Geography textbook.
- Solo read 15 pages on Monday.
- Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.
Total pages to read = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Step 2: Calculate the number of pages Solo has left to read.
Pages left to read = Total pages to read - Pages read on Monday
Pages left to read = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Step 3: Calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day.
Average pages to read per day = Pages left to read / Number of days left
Average pages to read per day =
