To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sunflowers Faraday sold after 3 days.

Given information:
- Sunflower cost: $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers cost: $8
- Earnings from sunflowers per day: $26
- Earnings from bouquets per day: $56
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
Earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of each sunflower = Number of sunflowers sold per day
$26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers sold per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
Earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of each bouquet = Number of bouquets sold per day
$56 / $8 = 7 bouquets sold per day

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold per day.
Number of bouquets sold per day Ã— Number of sunflowers per bouquet = Number of sunflowers
