Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sunflower costs $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers costs $8
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.
Sunflowers sold per day = Earnings from sunflowers per day / Cost of each sunflower
Sunflowers sold per day = $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers

Step 2: Calculate the number of bouquets sold per day.
Bouquets sold per day = Earnings from bouquets per day / Cost of each bouquet
Bouquets sold per day = $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days.
Total sunflowers sold = (Sunflowers sold per day × 3 days) + (Bouquets sold per day × 12
