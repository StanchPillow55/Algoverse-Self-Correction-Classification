Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sunflower costs $2 each
- Bouquet of sunflowers costs $8
- Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers and $56 from bouquets per day
- Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers

Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day.

Bouquets sold per day = 7
Sunflowers in bouquets sold per day =
