Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
- Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
- Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

Step 1: Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
30% of 30 = 0.3 × 30 = 9
Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Step 2: Calculate how many times Robert went down the water slide.
Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
Anne went down the slide 21 times.
Robert went down the slide 4 × 21 = 84 times.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Robert went down the water slide 84 times.
