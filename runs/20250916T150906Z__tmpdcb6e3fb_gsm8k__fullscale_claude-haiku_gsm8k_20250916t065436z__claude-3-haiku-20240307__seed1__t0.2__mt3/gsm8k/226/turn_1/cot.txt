Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards.
- He loses 8 of the water type cards.
- He buys 14 grass type cards.

Step 1: Calculate the new number of cards for each type after the changes.
Fire type: 30 (no change)
Grass type: 20 + 14 = 34
Water type: 40 - 8 = 32

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.
Total cards = Fire type + Grass type + Water type
Total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96

Step 3: Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) × 100
Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) × 100 = 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the final answer is:
The
