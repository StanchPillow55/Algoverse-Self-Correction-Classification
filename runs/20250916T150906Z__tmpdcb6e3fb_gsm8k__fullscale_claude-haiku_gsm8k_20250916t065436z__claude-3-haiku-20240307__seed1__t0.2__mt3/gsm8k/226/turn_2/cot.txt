Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type Pokemon cards.
- He loses 8 of the water type cards.
- He buys 14 grass type cards.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cards James has after the changes.
Initial total cards = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards
Lose 8 water type cards = 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards
Buy 14 grass type cards = 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards
New total cards = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of water type cards James has after the changes.
Water type cards = 32

Step 3: Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
Percentage of water type cards = (Number of water type cards / Total cards) x 100
Percentage of water type cards = (32 / 96) x
