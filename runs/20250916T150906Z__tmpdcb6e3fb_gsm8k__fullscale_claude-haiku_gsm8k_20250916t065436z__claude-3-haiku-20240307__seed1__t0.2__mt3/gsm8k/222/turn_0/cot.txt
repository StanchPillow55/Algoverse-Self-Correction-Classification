Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andy plants 90 geraniums.
- Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

Step 1: Calculate the number of petunias Andy plants.
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants.
Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50 = 140

Therefore, the total number of flowers Andy plants is 140.

Final answer: Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.
