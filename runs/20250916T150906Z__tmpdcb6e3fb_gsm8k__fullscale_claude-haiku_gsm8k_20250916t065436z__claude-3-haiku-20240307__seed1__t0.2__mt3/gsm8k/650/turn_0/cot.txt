Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Tuesday's Purchase:
* Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each
* Total cost before discount: 20 x $20 = $400
* Discount from voucher: $2
* Final price paid on Tuesday: $400 - $2 = $398

Wednesday's Purchase:
* Price per pomegranate increased to $30
* Sheila bought 20 pomegranates
* Total cost before discount: 20 x $30 = $600
* Discount: 10% of $600 = 0.1 x $600 = $60
* Final price paid on Wednesday: $600 - $60 = $540

Difference between the final prices paid on the two days:
* Final price on Tuesday: $398
* Final price on Wednesday: $540
* Difference: $540 - $398 = $142

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.
