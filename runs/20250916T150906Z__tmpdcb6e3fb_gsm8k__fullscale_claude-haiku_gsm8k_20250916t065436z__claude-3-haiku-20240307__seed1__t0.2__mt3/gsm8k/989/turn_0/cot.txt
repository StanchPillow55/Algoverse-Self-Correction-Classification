To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Given information:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- Emily needs to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp.
Time to sauté 90 shrimp = (90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes) × 10 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
Total time = Time to peel + Time to sauté
Total time = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will
