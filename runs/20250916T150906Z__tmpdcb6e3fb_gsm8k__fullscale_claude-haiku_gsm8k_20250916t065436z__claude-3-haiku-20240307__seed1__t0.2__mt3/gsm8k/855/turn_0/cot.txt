Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- You are 3 years younger than your brother.
- You are 2 years older than your sister.
- Your mom's age is 1 less than 3 times your brother's age.
- The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's define the variables:
- Let your brother's age be x.
- Then, your age is x - 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 5 (since you are 2 years older than her).
- Your mom's age is 3x - 1.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for your age:

Sum of all ages = 87
(x - 3) + x + (x - 5) + (3x - 1) = 87
6x - 9 = 87
6x = 96
x = 16

Therefore, your brother's age is 16.

Now, we can calculate your age:
Your age = x - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
