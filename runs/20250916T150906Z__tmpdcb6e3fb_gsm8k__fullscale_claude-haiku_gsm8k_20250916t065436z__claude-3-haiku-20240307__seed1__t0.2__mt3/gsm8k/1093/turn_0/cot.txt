To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the walls that need to be painted and then calculate the number of gallons of paint required and the total cost.

Given information:
- The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet.
- The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet.
- A gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and costs $12.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the north and south walls.
Area of north and south walls = 2 × (10 feet × 8 feet) = 160 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of the east and west walls.
Area of east and west walls = 2 × (5 feet × 8 feet) = 80 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted.
Total area = Area of north and south walls + Area of east and west walls
Total area = 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the number of gallons of paint required.
Number of gallons require
