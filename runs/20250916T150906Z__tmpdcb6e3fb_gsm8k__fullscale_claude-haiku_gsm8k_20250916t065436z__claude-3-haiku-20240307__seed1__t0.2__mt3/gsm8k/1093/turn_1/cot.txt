Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the total area of the walls that need to be painted:
   * North wall: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft
   * South wall: 10 ft x 8 ft = 80 sq ft
   * East wall: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft
   * West wall: 5 ft x 8 ft = 40 sq ft
   * Total area = 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 sq ft

2. Calculate how many gallons of paint are needed:
   * 1 gallon of paint can cover 20 sq ft
   * Total area to be painted = 240 sq ft
   * Number of gallons needed = 240 sq ft / 20 sq ft per gallon = 12 gallons

3. Calculate the total cost of the paint:
   * 1 gallon of paint costs $12
   * Total cost of paint = 12 gallons x $12 per gal
