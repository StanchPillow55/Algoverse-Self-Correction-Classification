Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sugar Cubes:
   * The farmer buys 2 boxes of 1-pound sugar cubes
   * Total weight of sugar cubes = 2 x 1 pound = 2 pounds

2. Carrots:
   * The farmer buys 4 bags of 12-pound carrots
   * Total weight of carrots = 4 x 12 pounds = 48 pounds

3. Hay:
   * The farmer buys 42 bales of 75-pound hay
   * Total weight of hay = 42 x 75 pounds = 3,150 pounds

4. Oats:
   * The farmer buys 20 sacks of 65-pound oats
   * Total weight of oats = 20 x 65 pounds = 1,300 pounds

5. Total weight of all feed:
   * Total weight = Sugar Cubes + Carrots + Hay + Oats
   * Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3,150
