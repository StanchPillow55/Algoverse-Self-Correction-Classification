Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and serves 4 people.
2. There will be 20 people watching the game.
3. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

To find the total cost, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
2. Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.
3. Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed.
* Each sandwich serves 4 people.
* 20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches needed.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese required.
* Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
* 5 sandwiches x 1 pound of meat per sandwich = 5 pounds of meat.
* 5 sandwiches x 1 pound of cheese per
