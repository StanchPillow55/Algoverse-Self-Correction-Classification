Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each muffaletta sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese.
- Each sandwich serves 4 people.
- There will be 20 people watching the game.
- The meat costs $7.00 per pound.
- The cheese costs $3.00 per pound.

Step 1: Calculate the number of sandwiches needed to serve 20 people.
Number of people / Number of people per sandwich = Number of sandwiches
20 people / 4 people per sandwich = 5 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed.
Number of sandwiches × 1 pound of meat per sandwich = Total meat needed
5 sandwiches × 1 pound = 5 pounds of meat

Number of sandwiches × 1 pound of cheese per sandwich = Total cheese needed
5 sandwiches × 1 pound = 5 pounds of cheese

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese.
Cost of meat = Total meat neede
