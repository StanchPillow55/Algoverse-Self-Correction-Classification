Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ann is 9 years old.
- Ann's brother is twice her age.

Step 1: Find the current age of Ann's brother.
Ann's brother's age = 2 × Ann's age
Ann's brother's age = 2 × 9 = 18 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Ann's brother in 3 years.
Age of Ann's brother in 3 years = Current age of Ann's brother + 3 years
Age of Ann's brother in 3 years = 18 + 3 = 21 years old

Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.
