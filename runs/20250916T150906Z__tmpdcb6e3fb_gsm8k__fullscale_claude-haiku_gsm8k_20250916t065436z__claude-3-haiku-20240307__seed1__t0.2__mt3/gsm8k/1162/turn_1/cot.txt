Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.
- Haley is 26 years old.

Step 1: Find half the age of Haley.
Half the age of Haley = 26 / 2 = 13 years

Step 2: Find Geb's age.
Geb's age = Half the age of Haley - 10
Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.
