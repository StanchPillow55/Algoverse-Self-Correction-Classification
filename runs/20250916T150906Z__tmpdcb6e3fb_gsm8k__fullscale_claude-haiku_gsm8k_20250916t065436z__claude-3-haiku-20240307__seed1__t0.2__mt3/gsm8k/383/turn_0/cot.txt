Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Millie spends $18 to buy supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
- Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
- Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
- Millie sells all of the lemonade.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.
Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers × 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Millie will make from selling all the lemonade.
Total revenue = 36 cups × $1 per cup = $36

Step 3: Calculate Millie's profit per hour.
Profit per hour = Total revenue - Cost of supplies
Profit per hour = $36 - $18 = $18

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $18 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stan
