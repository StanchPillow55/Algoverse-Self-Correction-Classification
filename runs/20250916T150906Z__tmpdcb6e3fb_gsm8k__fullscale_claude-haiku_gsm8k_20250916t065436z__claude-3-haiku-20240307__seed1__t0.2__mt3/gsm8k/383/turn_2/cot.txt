Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to:
1. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
2. Subtract the initial cost of supplies.
3. Divide the profit by the number of hours the stand is open.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.
* Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups
* Revenue = 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36

Step 2: Calculate the profit.
* Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost of supplies
* Profit = $36 - $18 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the profit per hour.
* Profit per hour = Profit / Hours the stand is open
*
