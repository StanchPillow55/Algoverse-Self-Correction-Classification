Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to find the total revenue and total cost, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Total Revenue:
* 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade
* 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36 total revenue

Total Cost:
* $18 spent on supplies

Profit per Hour:
* Total Revenue - Total Cost = $36 - $18 = $18
* Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour
* $18 profit / 4 cups per hour = $4.50 profit per hour

Therefore, Millie will make $4.50 profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.
