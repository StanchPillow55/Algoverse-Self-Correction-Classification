To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of both tickets winning.

Given information:
- The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning.
- The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

Step 1: Find the probability of the second ticket winning.
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × Probability of the first ticket winning
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × 0.20 = 0.60 or 60%

Step 2: Find the probability of both tickets winning.
Probability of both tickets winning = Probability of the first ticket winning × Probability of the second ticket winning
Probability of both tickets winning = 0.20 × 0.60 = 0.12 or 12%

Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners, expressed as a percentage, is 12%.
