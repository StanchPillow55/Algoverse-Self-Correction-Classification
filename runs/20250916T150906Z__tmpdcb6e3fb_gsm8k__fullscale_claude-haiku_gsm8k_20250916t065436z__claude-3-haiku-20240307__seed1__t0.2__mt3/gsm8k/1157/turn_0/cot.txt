Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.
- Carl is 1 foot taller than his brother, Ned.
- Ned is 2 feet shorter than his cousin, Isabel.
- Isabel is 7 feet tall.

Step 1: Find Ned's height.
Isabel's height = 7 feet
Ned's height = Isabel's height - 2 feet
Ned's height = 7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet

Step 2: Find Carl's height.
Carl's height = Ned's height + 1 foot
Carl's height = 5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet

Step 3: Find the length of Carl's cane.
Carl's cane length = 1/2 of Carl's height
Carl's cane length = 1/2 Ã— 6 feet = 3 feet

Therefore, the length of Carl's cane is 3 feet.
