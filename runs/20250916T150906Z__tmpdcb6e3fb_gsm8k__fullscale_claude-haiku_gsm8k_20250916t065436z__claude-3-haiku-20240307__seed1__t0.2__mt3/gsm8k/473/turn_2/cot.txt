Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The shark's body length is 10 feet.
- There are 2 remoras attached to the shark, each with a length of 6 inches.

Step 1: Convert the shark's body length from feet to inches.
10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
Length of one remora = 6 inches
Combined length of two remoras = 2 × 6 inches = 12 inches

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras represents.
Percentage = (Combined length of remoras / Shark's body length) × 100
Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) × 100
Percentage = 0.1 × 100
Percentage = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer: The combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark
