Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The shark is 10 feet long.
- There are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long.

Step 1: Convert the shark's length from feet to inches.
10 feet × 12 inches/foot = 120 inches

Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the two remoras.
2 remoras × 6 inches each = 12 inches

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined remora length represents.
Percentage = (Combined remora length / Shark's body length) × 100
Percentage = (12 inches / 120 inches) × 100
Percentage = 0.1 × 100
Percentage = 10%

Therefore, the combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

Final answer: The combined length of the two remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.
