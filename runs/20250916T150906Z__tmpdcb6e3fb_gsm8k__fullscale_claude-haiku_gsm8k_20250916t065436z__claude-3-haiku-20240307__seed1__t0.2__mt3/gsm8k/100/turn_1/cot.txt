Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him.
- The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
- The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
- The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
- The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

Step 1: Calculate the number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell.
The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend.
Number of times the second friend pressed the doorbell = 20 + (20 × 1/4) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Step 2: Calculate the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell.
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.
Number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell = 60 × 10 = 600 times.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of doorbell rings.
