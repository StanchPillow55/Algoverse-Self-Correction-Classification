To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services Tim is getting and compare it to the cost of his previous cable package.

Given information:
- Netflix costs $10 per month.
- Hulu and Disney Plus normally cost $10 each per month, but he saves 20% for bundling.
- Tim's previous cable package cost $60 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the streaming services.
Netflix cost: $10 per month
Hulu and Disney Plus cost with 20% discount:
- Normal cost: $10 + $10 = $20 per month
- Discounted cost: $20 - (20% of $20) = $20 - $4 = $16 per month
Total cost of streaming services: $10 + $16 = $26 per month

Step 2: Calculate the savings by cancelling the cable package.
Cost of cable package: $60 per month
Cost of streaming services: $26 per month
Savings: $60 - $26 = $34 per month

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month
