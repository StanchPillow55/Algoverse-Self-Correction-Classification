Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark has $50 in his bank account.
2. He earns $10 per day at his work.
3. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300.

To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save to reach the $300 required for the bike.

* Amount needed for the bike: $300
* Amount Mark currently has: $50
* Amount Mark needs to save: $300 - $50 = $250

Now, we need to figure out how many days it will take Mark to save the remaining $250.

* Mark earns $10 per day
* $250 / $10 per day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.
