Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark has $50 in his bank account.
- He earns $10 per day at his work.
- The bike he wants to buy costs $300.

Step 1: Calculate how much more money Mark needs to save to buy the bike.
Cost of the bike - Amount in his bank account = Amount Mark needs to save
$300 - $50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate how much Mark earns per day.
Mark earns $10 per day at his work.

Step 3: Calculate how many days Mark needs to save to have the required $250.
Amount Mark needs to save / Amount Mark earns per day = Number of days
$250 / $10 per day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.
