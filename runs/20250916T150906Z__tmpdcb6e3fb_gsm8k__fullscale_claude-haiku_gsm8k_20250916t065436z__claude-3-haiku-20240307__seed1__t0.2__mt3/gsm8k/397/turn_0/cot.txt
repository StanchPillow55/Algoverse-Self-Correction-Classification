Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Mark has $50 in his bank account.
- He earns $10 per day at his work.
- The bike he wants to buy costs $300.

To find the number of days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Mark needs to save.
Amount needed for the bike = $300
Amount Mark currently has = $50
Amount Mark needs to save = $300 - $50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Mark needs to save.
Amount Mark needs to save = $250
Amount Mark earns per day = $10
Number of days needed to save = $250 / $10 = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to be able to buy the bike that costs $300.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to be able to buy the bike that costs $300.
