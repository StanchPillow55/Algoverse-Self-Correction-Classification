Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

2. John then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
   * For the first 2 hours, he is in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance.

3. For the next half-hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.
   * Distance traveled = Speed x Time
   * Distance = 80 mph x 1.5 hours = 120 miles

5. Total distance traveled:
   * Distance traveled on the way out = 180 miles
   * Distance traveled on the way back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135
