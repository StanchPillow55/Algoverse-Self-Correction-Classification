Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph:
   * Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours:
   * The first 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic, so no distance is covered.
   * For the next half-hour, he drives at 30 mph:
     * Distance traveled = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   * For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 mph:
     * Distance traveled = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

3. Total distance traveled:
   * Distance traveled on the way out = 180 miles
   * Distance traveled on the way back = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles
   * Total distance = 180 miles + 135 miles = 315 miles

4. Distance from home at the
