To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John traveled during each part of his journey and then find the final distance from home at the end of the 4 hours.

Given information:
- John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
- He turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours.
- He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
- He drives at a speed of 30 mph for the next half-hour.
- He drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining time of the 4 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance John traveled during the first 3 hours.
Distance traveled = Speed × Time
Distance traveled = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance John traveled during the remaining 4 hours.
Time spent in standstill traffic = 2 hours
Time spent driving at 30 mph = 0.5 hours
Time spent driving at 80 mph = 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5
