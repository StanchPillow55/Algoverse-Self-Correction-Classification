To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of picture scenes Lauren needs to create and then calculate the number of days it will take her to complete the project.

Given information:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- Lauren was hired to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of picture scenes Lauren needs to create.
Total number of picture scenes = 45 large-sized + 36 medium-sized + 49 small-sized
Total number of picture scenes = 45 + 36 + 49 = 130 picture scenes

Step 2: Calculate the number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes.
For large-sized picture scenes:
Number of days = 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes:
Number of days = 36 medium
