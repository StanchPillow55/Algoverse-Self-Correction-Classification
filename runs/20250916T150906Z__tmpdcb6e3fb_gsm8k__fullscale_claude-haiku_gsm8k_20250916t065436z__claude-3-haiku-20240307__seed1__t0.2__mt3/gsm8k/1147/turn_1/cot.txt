Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lauren can draw:
   - 5 large-sized picture scenes per day
   - 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day
   - 7 small-sized picture scenes per day

2. She was hired to create:
   - 45 large-sized picture scenes
   - 36 medium-sized picture scenes
   - 49 small-sized picture scenes

3. To calculate the number of days it will take her to create all the picture scenes, we need to find the number of days required for each size of picture scene.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
- 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
- 36 medium-sized picture scenes / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = 6 days

For the small-sized picture scenes:
- 49 small-sized picture scenes / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = 7 days

4. To find the total number of days, we ad
