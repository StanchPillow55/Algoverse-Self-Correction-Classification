Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day
- Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day
- Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day
- Lauren was hired to create:
  - 45 large-sized picture scenes
  - 36 medium-sized picture scenes
  - 49 small-sized picture scenes

To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scene and then add them together.

Step 2: Calculate the number of days required for the medium-sized picture scenes.
Number of medium-sized picture scenes = 36
Number of medium-sized picture scenes per day =
