Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
- Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
- George has 18 pens.

Step 1: Find the number of pens Timothy has.
Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we can calculate Timothy's pens as:
Timothy's pens = 3 × George's pens
Timothy's pens = 3 × 18 = 54 pens

Step 2: Find the number of pens Sarah has.
Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we can calculate Sarah's pens as:
Sarah's pens = 1/2 × Timothy's pens
Sarah's pens = 1/2 × 54 = 27 pens

Therefore, the final answer is:
Sarah has 27 pens.
