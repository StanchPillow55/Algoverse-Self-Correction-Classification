Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greg found $20 while walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings.
- He decided to split the money equally among them.

To find the amount of money each person got, we need to divide the total amount of money ($20) by the number of people (4, including Greg and his 3 siblings).

Step 1: Divide the total amount of money by the number of people.
Total amount of money = $20
Number of people = 4 (Greg and his 3 siblings)
Amount of money per person = $20 รท 4 = $5

Therefore, each of them (Greg and his 3 siblings) got $5 from the $20 that Greg found.

Final answer: Each person got $5.
