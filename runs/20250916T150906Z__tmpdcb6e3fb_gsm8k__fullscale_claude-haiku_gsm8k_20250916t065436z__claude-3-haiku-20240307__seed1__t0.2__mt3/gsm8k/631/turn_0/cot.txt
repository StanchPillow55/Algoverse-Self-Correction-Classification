Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond Jewell.
- The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold Jewell.
- The price of a diamond Jewell is $2000.

Step 1: Find the price of a gold Jewell.
Price of a gold Jewell = 4/5 × Price of a diamond Jewell
Price of a gold Jewell = 4/5 × $2000 = $1600

Step 2: Find the price of a silver Jewell.
Price of a silver Jewell = Price of a gold Jewell - $400
Price of a silver Jewell = $1600 - $400 = $1200

Step 3: Find the total price for all three jewels.
Total price = Price of a diamond Jewell + Price of a gold Jewell + Price of a silver Jewell
Total price = $2000 + $1600
