Given information:
- Colby's parents give him $150 per month to spend at the movies.
- Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10.
- Tickets for any other day cost $7.
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Boxes of candy cost $2 each.
- Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday.
- Colby has already seen 8 movies on other days.
- Colby has already had 2 tubs of popcorn.
- Colby has already had 4 boxes of candy.
- It is the last day of the month, and it's a Friday.
