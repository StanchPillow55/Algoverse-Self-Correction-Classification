To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Colby has spent on movies, popcorn, and candy, and then determine how many more movies he can see with the remaining budget.

Given information:
- Colby's monthly movie budget is $150.
- Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10.
- Tickets for any other day cost $7.
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Boxes of candy cost $2 each.
- Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy.
- It's the last day of the month, and it's a Friday.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the movies Colby has already seen.
Cost of movies on Fridays and Saturdays = 5 × $10 = $50
Cost of movies on other days = 8 × $7 = $56
Total cost of movies already seen = $50 + $56 = $106
