Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Colby's parents give him $150 per month to spend at the movies.
- Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10.
- Tickets for any other day cost $7.
- Popcorn costs $8 per tub.
- Boxes of candy cost $2 each.
- It's the last day of the month and it's a Friday.
- Colby has already seen 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday.
- Colby has already seen 8 movies on other days.
- Colby has already had 2 tubs of popcorn.
- Colby has already had 4 boxes of candy.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Colby has already spent this month.
Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays: 5 × $10 = $50
Tickets for other days: 8 × $7 = $56
Popcorn: 2 × $8 = $16
Candy: 4 ×
