Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones
- Each cell phone costs $150
- The payment plan is for 3 months
- There is a 2% interest charge for each unit

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 5 cell phones without the interest.
Total cost of cell phones = 5 × $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the interest charge for each cell phone.
Interest charge per cell phone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 × $150 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total interest charge for all 5 cell phones.
Total interest charge = 5 × $3 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Shiela will pay, including the interest.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest charge
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment for the 3-month installment plan.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3
