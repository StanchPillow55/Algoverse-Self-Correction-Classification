Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday, she saw double the number of clouds as the day before.
- We need to find the total number of clouds she counted across all 5 days (Monday through Friday).

Step 1: Calculate the number of clouds Alice counted each day.
Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 3 x 2 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: 6 x 2 = 12 clouds 
Thursday: 12 x 2 = 24 clouds
Friday: 24 x 2 = 48 clouds

Step 2: Calculate the total number of clouds counted across all 5 days.
Total clouds = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday
Total clouds = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds

Therefore, the total number of clouds Alice counted in the sky at lunch across all five days (Monday through Friday) is 93 clouds.
