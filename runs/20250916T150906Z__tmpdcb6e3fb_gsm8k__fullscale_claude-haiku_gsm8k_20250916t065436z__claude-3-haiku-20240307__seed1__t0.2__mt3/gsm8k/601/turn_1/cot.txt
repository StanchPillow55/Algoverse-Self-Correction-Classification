Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Year 1:
* Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday
* He buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so that's 12 more games
* He gets 5 games for Christmas
* Total games at the end of Year 1 = 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games

Year 2: 
* He starts with 22 games from Year 1
* He buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so that's 24 more games 
* He gets 5 games for Christmas
* Total games at the end of Year 2 = 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games

Year 3:
* He starts with 51 games from Year 2
* He buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so that's 48 more games
* He gets 5 games for Christmas
* Total games at the end of Year 3 = 51 + 48 + 5
