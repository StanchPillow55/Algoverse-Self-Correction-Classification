Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Smith has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.
- He sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y.
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 × Goats sold from Farm X
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 × 10 = 20 goats

Step 2: Calculate the number of goats left in Farm X.
Goats left in Farm X = Initial goats in Farm X - Goats sold from Farm X
Goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45 goats

Step 3: Calculate the number of goats left in Farm Y.
Goats left in Farm Y = Initial goats in Farm Y - Goats sold from Farm Y
Goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25 goats
