Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Smith has two farms: Farm X and Farm Y.
- Farm X has 55 goats.
- Farm Y has 45 goats.
- Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
- Mr. Smith sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goats sold from Farm Y.
Goats sold from Farm X = 10
Goats sold from Farm Y = 2 Ã— 10 = 20

Step 2: Calculate the number of goats left in each farm.
Goats left in Farm X = 55 - 10 = 45
Goats left in Farm Y = 45 - 20 = 25

Step 3: Calculate the total number of goats left in the two farms.
Total goats left = Goats left in Farm X + Goats left in Farm Y
Total goats left = 45 + 25 = 70

Therefore, there are 70 go
