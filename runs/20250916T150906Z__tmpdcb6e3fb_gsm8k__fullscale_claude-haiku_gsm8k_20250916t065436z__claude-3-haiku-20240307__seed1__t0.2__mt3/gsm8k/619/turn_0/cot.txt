To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at each intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights on the road.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to find the number of functioning street lights.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at each intersection.
* Each pole has 4 street lights.
* There are 6 poles at each intersection.
* Total street lights per intersection = 4 street lights per pole × 6 poles = 24 street lights.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights on the road.
* There are 4 intersections on the road.
* Total street lights on the road = 24 street lights per intersection × 4 intersections = 96 street lights.

Step 3: Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to find the number of functioning street lights.
* There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
* Functioning street lights = Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights
* Functioning street lights = 96 -
