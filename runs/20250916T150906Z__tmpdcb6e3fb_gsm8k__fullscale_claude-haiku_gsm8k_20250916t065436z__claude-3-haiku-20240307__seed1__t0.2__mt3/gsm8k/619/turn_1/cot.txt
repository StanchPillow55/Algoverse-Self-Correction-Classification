Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights.
- The number of poles at each intersection is 6.
- The road has 4 intersections.
- 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights.
Number of street lights per pole = 4
Number of poles per intersection = 6
Number of intersections = 4

Total number of street lights = Number of street lights per pole × Number of poles per intersection × Number of intersections
Total number of street lights = 4 × 6 × 4 = 96 street lights

Step 2: Calculate the number of functioning street lights.
Total number of street lights = 96
Number of street lights not working = 20

Number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of street lights not working
Number of functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76 street lights

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76.
