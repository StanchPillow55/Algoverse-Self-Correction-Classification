Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. There are 6 poles at each intersection.
3. There are 4 intersections on the road.
4. The total number of street lights is the number of poles multiplied by the number of street lights per pole, multiplied by the number of intersections.

Total number of street lights = 6 poles per intersection x 4 street lights per pole x 4 intersections
= 96 street lights

5. We are told that 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:
Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights
= 96 - 20
= 76 functioning street lights

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76.
