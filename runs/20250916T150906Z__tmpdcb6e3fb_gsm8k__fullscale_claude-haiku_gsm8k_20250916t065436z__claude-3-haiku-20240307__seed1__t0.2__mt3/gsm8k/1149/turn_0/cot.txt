Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jen got 3 fish.
- Each fish needs $1 worth of food per day.
- We need to find how much Jen spends on food in the month of May.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food needed per day.
Since each fish needs $1 worth of food per day, and Jen has 3 fish, the total amount of food needed per day is:
3 fish × $1 per fish = $3 per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of days in the month of May.
May has 31 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on food in the month of May.
Total amount spent on food = Total amount of food needed per day × Number of days in May
Total amount spent on food = $3 per day × 31 days = $93

Therefore, Jen will spend $93 on food for her 3 fish in the month of May.

Final answer: Jen will spend $93 on food for her 3 fish in the month of May
