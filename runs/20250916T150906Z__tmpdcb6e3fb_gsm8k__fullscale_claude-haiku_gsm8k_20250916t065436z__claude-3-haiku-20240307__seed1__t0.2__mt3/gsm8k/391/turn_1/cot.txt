Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6.
- The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

Step 1: Find the total parts in the ratio.
Total parts = 5 + 6 = 11

Step 2: Find the value of each part in the ratio.
Total popsicles / Total parts = Value of each part
165 / 11 = 15

Step 3: Find the number of popsicles Betty has.
Betty's popsicles = 5 parts × 15 = 75 popsicles

Step 4: Find the number of popsicles Sam has.
Sam's popsicles = 6 parts × 15 = 90 popsicles

Step 5: Find the difference between the number of popsicles Sam and Betty have.
Sam's popsicles - Betty's popsicles = 90 - 75 = 15 popsicles

Therefore, Sam has
