Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6.
- The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

Step 1: Find the total parts in the ratio.
The ratio is 5:6, so the total parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Step 2: Find the value of each part in the ratio.
Total popsicles / Total parts = Value of each part
165 / 11 = 15

Step 3: Find the number of popsicles that Betty has.
Betty's part in the ratio = 5
Number of popsicles Betty has = 5 × 15 = 75

Step 4: Find the number of popsicles that Sam has.
Sam's part in the ratio = 6
Number of popsicles Sam has = 6 × 15 = 90

Step 5: Find the difference between the number of popsicles that Sam and Betty have.
Sam's popsicles - Betty
