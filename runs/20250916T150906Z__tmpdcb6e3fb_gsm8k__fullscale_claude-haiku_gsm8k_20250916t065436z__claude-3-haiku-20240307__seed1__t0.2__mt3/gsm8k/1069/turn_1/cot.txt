Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer packed in bags.
- 2 hours after the trucks had departed, a quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer dispatched.
Total number of trucks = 20
Fertilizer per truck = 20 tons
Total fertilizer dispatched = 20 trucks × 20 tons = 400 tons

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 = 5 trucks

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that could not be delivered.
Fertilizer per truck = 20 tons
Fertilizer not delivered = 5 trucks × 20 tons = 100 tons

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers.
Total fertilizer dispatched - Fertilizer not delivere
