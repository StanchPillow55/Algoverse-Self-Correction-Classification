Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks dispatched for delivery.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer packed in bags.
- 2 hours after the trucks had departed, a quarter of the number of trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer dispatched.
Total fertilizer dispatched = Number of trucks × Tons of fertilizer per truck
Total fertilizer dispatched = 20 trucks × 20 tons/truck = 400 tons

Step 2: Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 trucks = 5 trucks

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of fertilizer that reached the farmers.
Total fertilizer that reached the farmers = Total fertilizer dispatched - Fertilizer in trucks with mechanical failures
Total fertilizer that reached the farmers = 400 tons - (5 trucks × 20 tons/truck) = 400 tons - 100 tons =
