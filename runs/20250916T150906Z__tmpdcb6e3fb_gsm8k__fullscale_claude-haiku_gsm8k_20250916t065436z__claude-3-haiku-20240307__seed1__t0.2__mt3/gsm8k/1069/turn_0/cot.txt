To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all the trucks.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to the mechanical failures.
4. Subtract the amount of fertiliser not delivered from the total amount of fertiliser to find the final amount that reached the farmers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all the trucks.
* Mr Hezekiah had 20 trucks, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
* Total amount of fertiliser = 20 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 400 tons.

Step 2: Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
* A quarter of the number of trucks dispatched had mechanical failures.
* Number of trucks with mechanical failures = 1/4 × 20 = 5 trucks.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to the mechanical failures.
* Amount of fertiliser not delivered = 5 trucks × 20 tons per truck = 100
