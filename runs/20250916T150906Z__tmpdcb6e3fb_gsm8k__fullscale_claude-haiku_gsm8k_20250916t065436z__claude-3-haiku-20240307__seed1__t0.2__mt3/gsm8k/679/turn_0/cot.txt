Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns
- We need to find how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes

Step 1: Find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns.
6 potatoes = 36 hash browns
Ratio of potatoes to hash browns = 6:36 = 1:6

This means that for every 1 potato, we can make 6 hash browns.

Step 2: Use the ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.
Number of hash browns = Number of potatoes × Ratio of potatoes to hash browns
Number of hash browns = 96 × 6 = 576 hash browns

Therefore, you can make 576 hash browns from 96 potatoes.

Final answer: 576 hash browns
