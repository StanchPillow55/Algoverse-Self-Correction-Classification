Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The hat Thea bought from the craftsman in Bali is worth $70.
- Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills.

To find the change Thea received, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Thea paid for the hat.
Total amount paid = 4 Ã— $20 = $80

Step 2: Calculate the change Thea received.
Change = Total amount paid - Cost of the hat
Change = $80 - $70 = $10

Therefore, the change Thea received from the craftsman is $10.

Final answer: Thea received $10 in change.
