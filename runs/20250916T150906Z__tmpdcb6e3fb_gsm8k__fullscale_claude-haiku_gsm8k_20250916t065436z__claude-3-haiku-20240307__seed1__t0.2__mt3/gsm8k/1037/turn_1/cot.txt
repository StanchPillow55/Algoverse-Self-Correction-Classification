Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound
- Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound
- Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of Mozzarella
- Amor starts with $50 cash

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese.
Cost of Parmesan = 2 pounds × $11 per pound = $22

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese.
Cost of Mozzarella = 3 pounds × $6 per pound = $18

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the cheese.
Total cost of cheese = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella
Total cost of cheese = $22 + $18 = $40

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Amor has left to buy meat.
Amount of money left = Initial cash - Total cost of cheese
Amount of money left = $50 - $40 = $10
