Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that:
   * 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts:
   * 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

4. To find the amount of money he had leftover after paying his debts, we need to subtract the amount used to pay debts from the total loan amount:
   * $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Therefore, the amount of money John had leftover after paying his debts is $40,000.
