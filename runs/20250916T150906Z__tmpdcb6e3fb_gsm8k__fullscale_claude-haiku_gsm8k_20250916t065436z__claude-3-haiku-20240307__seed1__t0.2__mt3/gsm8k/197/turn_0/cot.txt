To solve this problem, we need to find the number of children in the city of Soda.

Given information:
- The total population of Soda is 23786 inhabitants.
- There are 8417 men and 9092 women in the city.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of adults (men and women) in the city.
Total adults = Number of men + Number of women
Total adults = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

Step 2: Calculate the number of children in the city.
Number of children = Total population - Total adults
Number of children = 23786 - 17509 = 6277

Therefore, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda.

Final answer: There are 6277 children in the city of Soda.
