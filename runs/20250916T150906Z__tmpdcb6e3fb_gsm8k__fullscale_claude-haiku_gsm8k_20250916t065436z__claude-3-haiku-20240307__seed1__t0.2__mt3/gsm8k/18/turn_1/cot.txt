Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.
2. We need to find out how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks.

To calculate this, we need to:
* Find out how many eggs she eats in 1 day
* Find out how many eggs she eats in 1 week
* Find out how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks

Step 1: Eggs eaten in 1 day
* Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning
* So, she eats 3 eggs per day

Step 2: Eggs eaten in 1 week
* There are 7 days in a week
* So, she eats 3 eggs per day x 7 days = 21 eggs per week

Step 3: Eggs eaten in 4 weeks
* There are 4 weeks in 4 weeks
* So, she eats 21 eggs per week x 4 weeks = 84 eggs in 4 weeks

Step 4: Convert to
