To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.

Given information:
- Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning for breakfast.
- We need to find the number of dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Claire will eat in 1 day.
Number of eggs per omelet = 3
Number of omelets per day = 1
Number of eggs per day = 3 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Claire will eat in 1 week.
Number of days in a week = 7
Number of eggs per week = 3 eggs × 7 days = 21 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.
Number of weeks = 4
Number of eggs in 4 weeks = 21 eggs × 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
Number of dozens of eggs = 84 eggs ÷ 12
