To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of quilt blocks Gene has based on the given information.

Given information:
- Gene goes on 4 vacations per year.
- Gene has been vacationing since he was 23 years old.
- Gene is now 34 years old.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing.
Number of years = Gene's current age - Age when he started vacationing
Number of years = 34 years - 23 years = 11 years

Step 2: Calculate the total number of vacations Gene has taken.
Number of vacations per year × Number of years = Total number of vacations
4 vacations per year × 11 years = 44 vacations

Step 3: Calculate the total number of quilt blocks Gene has.
Total number of vacations = Total number of quilt blocks
44 quilt blocks

Therefore, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks in his quilt.

Final answer: Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.
