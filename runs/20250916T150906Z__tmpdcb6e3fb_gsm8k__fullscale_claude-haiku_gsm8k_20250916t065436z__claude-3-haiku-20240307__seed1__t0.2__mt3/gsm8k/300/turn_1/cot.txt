Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
- On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.
- On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday.
Time on Monday + Time on Sunday = 16 minutes + 23 minutes = 39 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday.
Time on Tuesday = 2 × Time on Monday and Sunday
Time on Tuesday = 2 × 39 minutes = 78 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the additional time Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday to reach his goal.
Additional time on Tuesday = Time on Tuesday - Time on Monday and Sunday
Additional time on Tuesday = 78 minutes - 39 minutes = 39 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.

Final answer: Peter needs to exercise for 39 minutes on Tuesday.
