Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jen has 6 yams that can be sold at $1.5 each.
- Jen has 10 sweet potatoes that cost $2 each.
- Jen has 4 carrots that cost $1.25 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the yams.
Total revenue from yams = Number of yams × Price per yam
Total revenue from yams = 6 × $1.5 = $9

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the sweet potatoes.
Total revenue from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes × Price per sweet potato
Total revenue from sweet potatoes = 10 × $2 = $20

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the carrots.
Total revenue from carrots = Number of carrots × Price per carrot
Total revenue from carrots = 4 × $1.25 = $5

Step 4: Calculate the total revenue Jen will earn by selling all the root crops.
Total revenue = Total revenue from
