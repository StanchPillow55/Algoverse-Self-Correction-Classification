Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows.
- Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
- Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls before Mr. Sylas bought the additional 40 cows.
Total cows in 10 stalls = 10 stalls Ã— 20 cows per stall = 200 cows

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas bought the additional 40 cows.
Total cows in 20 stalls = 200 cows (from step 1) + 40 new cows = 240 cows

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows in each stall after the 40 new cows are divided equally.
Cows per stall = Total cows in 20 stalls
