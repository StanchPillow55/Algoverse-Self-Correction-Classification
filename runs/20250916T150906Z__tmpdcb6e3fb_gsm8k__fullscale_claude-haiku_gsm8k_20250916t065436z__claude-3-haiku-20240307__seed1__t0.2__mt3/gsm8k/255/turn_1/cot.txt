Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have 10 stalls, each with 20 cows.
   * Total number of cows in the 10 stalls = 10 stalls x 20 cows per stall = 200 cows

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   * He divides these 40 cows equally among the 20 stalls (the original 10 stalls plus the 10 new stalls he created).
   * So each stall gets an additional 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

3. Now, each stall has:
   * Original 20 cows
   * Plus 2 additional cows
   * Total of 22 cows per stall

4. The question asks how many cows are in 8 of the stalls.
   * 8 stalls x 22 cows per stall = 176 cows

Therefore, the final answer is 176 cows in 8 of the stalls.
