To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls initially.
2. Calculate the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the 40 new cows.
3. Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls initially.
* 10 stalls with 20 cows each
* Total cows = 10 × 20 = 200 cows

Step 2: Calculate the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the 40 new cows.
* Total cows after adding 40 = 200 + 40 = 240 cows
* Number of stalls = 20
* Cows per stall = 240 ÷ 20 = 12 cows

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls.
* Number of cows in 8 stalls = 8 ×
