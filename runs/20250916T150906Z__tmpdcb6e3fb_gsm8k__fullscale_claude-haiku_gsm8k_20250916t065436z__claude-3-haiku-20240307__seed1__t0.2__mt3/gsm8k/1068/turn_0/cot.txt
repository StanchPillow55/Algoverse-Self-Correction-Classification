Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches:
   * 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches

2. Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs:
   * 7 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 28 meatballs

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches:
   * 4 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 16 meatballs eaten by Mark

4. Remaining meatballs after Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches:
   * 28 meatballs - 16 meatballs = 12 meatballs remaining

5. Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches:
   * 3 sub sandwiches x 4 meatballs per sub = 12 additional meatballs

6. Total meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remaine
