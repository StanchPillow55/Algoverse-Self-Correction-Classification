Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.

2. Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   * 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches ordered by Sidney

3. Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.
   * Sidney originally had 7 meatball sub sandwiches
   * Mark ate 4 of them
   * So Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 meatball sub sandwiches remaining

4. Sidney then ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.
   * So the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney had now is 3 + 3 = 6

5. To calculate the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained:
   * Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs
   * Sidney had 6 sub sandwiches remaining
   * So the total number of meatballs is 6 x 4 =
