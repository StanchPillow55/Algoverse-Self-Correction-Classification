Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
- At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of pie that were available.
Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
Total number of pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests.
Number of pieces taken by guests = Total number of pieces - Number of pieces remaining
Number of pieces taken by guests = 40 - 14 = 26 pieces

Therefore, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.
