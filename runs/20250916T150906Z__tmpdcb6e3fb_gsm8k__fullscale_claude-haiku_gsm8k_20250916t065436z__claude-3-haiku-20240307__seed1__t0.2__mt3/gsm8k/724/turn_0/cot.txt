Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bryce and 4 of his friends each ordered their own pizzas.
- Each pizza had 12 slices.
- Bryce and 2 of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
- The 2 remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices ordered.
Total number of pizzas = 5 (Bryce and 4 friends)
Total number of pizza slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 of his friends.
Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
Number of slices eaten by Bryce and 2 friends = 3 pizzas × 2/3 × 12 slices per pizza = 24 slices

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices eaten by the 2 remaining friends
