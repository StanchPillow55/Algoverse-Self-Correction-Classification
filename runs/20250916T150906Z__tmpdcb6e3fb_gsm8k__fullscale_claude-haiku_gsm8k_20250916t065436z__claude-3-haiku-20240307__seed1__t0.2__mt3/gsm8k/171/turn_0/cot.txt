Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) Jake sees 80 spiders, each with 8 legs:
   * 80 spiders x 8 legs per spider = 640 legs

2) Jake sees 90 insects, each with 6 legs:
   * 90 insects x 6 legs per insect = 540 legs

3) Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, each with 10 legs:
   * 3 invertebrates x 10 legs per invertebrate = 30 legs

4) To calculate the total number of legs Jake sees, we add up the legs from each type of creature:
   * 640 legs (spiders) + 540 legs (insects) + 30 legs (invertebrates) = 1,210 legs

Therefore, the total number of legs Jake sees is 1,210.
