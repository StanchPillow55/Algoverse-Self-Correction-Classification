Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- John bought 3 goats for $500 each.
- John bought 2 cows for $1500 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the goats.
Cost of 3 goats = 3 × $500 = $1500

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cows.
Cost of 2 cows = 2 × $1500 = $3000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money John spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of goats + Cost of cows
Total amount spent = $1500 + $3000 = $4500

Therefore, John spent a total of $4500 at the market.

Final answer: John spent $4500 at the market.
