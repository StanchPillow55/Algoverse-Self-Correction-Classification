Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The lake is 20 miles long.
- James can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
- He swims 60% of the distance.
- He rests on an island for half as long as the swimming time.
- He finishes the remaining distance at half the speed.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.
Distance swam = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 × 20 miles = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the 12 miles.
Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed
Time to swim 12 miles = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James spends resting on the island.
Time spent resting = 1/2 × Time spent swimming
Time spent resting = 1/2 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance remaining to be swam.
Distance remaining = Total distance
