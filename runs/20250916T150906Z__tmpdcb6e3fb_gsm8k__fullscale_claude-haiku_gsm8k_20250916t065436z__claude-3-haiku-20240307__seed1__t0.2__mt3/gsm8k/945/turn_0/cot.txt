To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The lake is 20 miles long.
- James can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
- James swims 60% of the distance.
- James rests on an island for half as long as the swimming time.
- James finishes the remaining distance at half the speed.

Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims.
Distance swam = 60% of 20 miles = 0.6 × 20 miles = 12 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes James to swim the first 12 miles.
Time to swim 12 miles = Distance / Speed = 12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time James rests on the island.
Rest time = Half of the swimming time = 0.5 × 6 hours = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the distance remaining to be swam.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance swam = 20 miles - 12
