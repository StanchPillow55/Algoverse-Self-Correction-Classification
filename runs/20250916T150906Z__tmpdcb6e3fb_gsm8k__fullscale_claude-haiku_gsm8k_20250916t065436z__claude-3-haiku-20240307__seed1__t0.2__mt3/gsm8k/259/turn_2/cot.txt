Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Step 1: Find how many apples Jamal has.

Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Step 3: Find how many bananas Andrea has.
Andrea has half as many bananas as
