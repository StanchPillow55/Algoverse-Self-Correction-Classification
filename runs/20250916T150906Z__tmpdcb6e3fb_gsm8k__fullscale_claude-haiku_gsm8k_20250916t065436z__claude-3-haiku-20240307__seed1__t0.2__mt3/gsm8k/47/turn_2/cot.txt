Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
- He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue ties John bought.
Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can divide the total cost by the cost per tie to find the number of blue ties.
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Step 2: Calculate the number of red ties John bought.
Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is twice the number of blue ties.
Number of red ties = 2 Ã— 5 = 10 red ties

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the red ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60 per red tie.
