Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
- The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.
- He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each.

Step 1: Find the number of blue ties John bought.
Since he spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, we can calculate the number of blue ties:
Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties

Step 2: Find the number of red ties John bought.
Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is:
Number of red ties = 2 Ã— 5 = 10 red ties

Step 3: Find the cost of the red ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of each red tie is:
Cost of red tie = $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60 per red tie

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the re
