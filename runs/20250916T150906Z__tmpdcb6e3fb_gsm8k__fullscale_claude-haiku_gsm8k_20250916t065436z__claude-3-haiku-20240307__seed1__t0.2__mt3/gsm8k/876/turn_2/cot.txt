Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Multiple-choice questions:
   * There are 10 multiple-choice questions
   * Amy correctly answers 80% of them
   * 80% of 10 = 0.8 * 10 = 8 correct answers
   * Each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point
   * So, Amy scores 8 points on the multiple-choice questions

2. True/false questions:
   * There are 20 true/false questions
   * Amy correctly answers 90% of them
   * 90% of 20 = 0.9 * 20 = 18 correct answers
   * Each true/false question is worth 1 point
   * So, Amy scores 18 points on the true/false questions

3. Long answer questions:
   * There are 5 long answer questions
   * Amy correctly answers 60% of them
   * 60% of 5 = 0.6 * 5 = 3 correct answers
   * Each long answer question is worth 5
