Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Billy has $10 to spend on candy.
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
- After buying the candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs.
- The gumballs cost $0.05 each.
- Billy bought 40 gumballs.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on the candy.
Amount spent on candy = $10

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Billy had after buying the candy.
Change = $10 - (amount spent on candy)
Change = $10 - $10 = $0

Since Billy has no change, he could not have bought 40 gumballs. We need to rework this problem.

Step 3: Recalculate the amount of candy Billy bought.
Amount spent on candy = $10
Price per pound of candy = $1.5
Pounds of candy bought = Amount spent on candy / Price per pound
Pounds of candy bought = $10 / $1.5 = 6.67
