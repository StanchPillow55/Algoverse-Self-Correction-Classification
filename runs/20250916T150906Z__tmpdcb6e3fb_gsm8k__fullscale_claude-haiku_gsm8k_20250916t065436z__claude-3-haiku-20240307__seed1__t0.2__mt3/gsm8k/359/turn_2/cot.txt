Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Billy has $10 to spend on candy.
- The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
- After buying the candy, he takes half his change and spends it on gumballs.
- The gumballs cost $0.05 each.
- Billy bought 40 gumballs.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on the candy.
Amount spent on candy = $10

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Billy had after buying the candy.
Change = Amount spent on candy - Cost of candy
Change = $10 - (Cost of candy)

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the gumballs.
Cost of gumballs = 40 Ã— $0.05 = $2

Step 4: Calculate the amount of change Billy had left after buying the gumballs.
Remaining change = Change - Cost of gumballs
Remaining change = (Amount spent on candy - Cost of candy) - $2

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Billy spent on the candy.
Amount spent on candy
