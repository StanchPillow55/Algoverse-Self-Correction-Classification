Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
- Dora is 15 years old.

Step 1: Find Dora's father's age.
Dora's father's age = 2 × Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 × 15 + 8 = 38 years old

Step 2: Find Dora's mother's age.
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.
Total combined age = Dora's age + Dora's father's age + Dora's mother's age
Total combined age = 15 + 38 + 34 = 87 years old

Therefore,
