Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
- Chatty has four children.
- Each child should receive the same number of eggs.

Step 1: Convert three dozen eggs to the total number of eggs.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
3 dozen = 3 ร 12 = 36 eggs

Step 2: Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find the number of eggs each child receives.
Total number of eggs = 36
Number of children = 4
Number of eggs each child receives = 36 รท 4 = 9 eggs

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.

Final answer: Each child receives 9 eggs.
