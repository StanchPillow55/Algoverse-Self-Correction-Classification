Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.
- When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as when the water is cold.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim a mile when the water is warm.
Time to swim a mile when water is cold = 16 minutes
Time to swim a mile when water is warm = 2 × 16 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a cold day = 3 × 16 minutes = 48 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day.
Time to swim 3 miles on a hot day = 3 × 34 minutes = 102 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the difference in time between swimming 3 miles on a hot day and a cold day.
Time difference
