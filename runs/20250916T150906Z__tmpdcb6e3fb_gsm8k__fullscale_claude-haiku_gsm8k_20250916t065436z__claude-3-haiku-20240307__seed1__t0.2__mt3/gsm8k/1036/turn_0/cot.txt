Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- There are 40 apples in one box.
- Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples.
- He is planning to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples in the two boxes.
Total number of apples = Number of apples in one box × Number of boxes
Total number of apples = 40 × 2 = 80 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of packs that can be made with 80 apples.
Number of apples per pack = 8
Number of packs = Total number of apples / Number of apples per pack
Number of packs = 80 / 8 = 10 packs

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Final answer: Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.
