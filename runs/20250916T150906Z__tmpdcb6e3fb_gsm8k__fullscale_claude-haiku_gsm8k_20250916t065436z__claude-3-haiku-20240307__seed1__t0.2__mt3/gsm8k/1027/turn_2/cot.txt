Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We have three different package sizes:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

2. We know that the prices are proportional, which means that the cost per sandwich is the same for all three packages.

3. To find the cost per sandwich, we can use the information from the first two packages:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3, so the cost per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6, so the cost per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50

4. Since the cost per sandwich is the same for all three packages, we can use this information to find the cost of the third package.

5. The third package has 8 sandwiches, and the cost per sandwich is $1.50.
   - Cost of the third package = 8
