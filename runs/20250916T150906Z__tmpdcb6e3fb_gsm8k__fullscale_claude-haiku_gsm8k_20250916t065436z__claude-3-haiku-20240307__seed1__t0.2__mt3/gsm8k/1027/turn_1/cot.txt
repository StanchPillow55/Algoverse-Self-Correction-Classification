Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three different package sizes:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

2. We know that the prices are proportional, which means that the cost per sandwich is the same across all three packages.

3. To find the cost per sandwich, we can use the information from the first two packages:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3, so cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6, so cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

4. Since the cost per sandwich is the same across all packages, we can use this information to find the cost of the third package.
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches
   - Cost per sandwich = $1.50
   - Total cost of Package 3 = 8
