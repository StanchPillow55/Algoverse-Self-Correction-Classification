To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price, and then use it to calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Given information:
- Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
- Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
- Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

Step 1: Find the cost per sandwich.
Cost per sandwich = Price of package / Number of sandwiches in the package

For Package 1:
Cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich

For Package 2:
Cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich is the same for all packages.

Step 2: Find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.
Cost of package with 8 sandwiches = Cost per sandwich × Number of sandwiches in the package
Cost of package with 8 sandwiches = $1.50 × 8 = $
