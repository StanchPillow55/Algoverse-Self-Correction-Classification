Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in the month of June.
- She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike in a day.
Miles hiked per day = 2 hikes × 125 miles per hike = 250 miles per day

Step 2: Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike in the month of June.
Total miles planned = 250 miles per day × 30 days in June = 7,500 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total miles Soledad wants to hike and the total miles she plans to hike.
Miles left to hike = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

Step 4: Calculate the additional miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey on time.
Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per
