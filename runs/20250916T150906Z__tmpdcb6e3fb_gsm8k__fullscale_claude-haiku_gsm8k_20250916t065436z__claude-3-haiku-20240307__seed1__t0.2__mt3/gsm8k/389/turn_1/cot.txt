Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 9 rides at the carnival
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides

Step 1: Calculate the cost of buying individual ride tickets for 9 rides.
Cost of 9 rides with individual tickets = 9 rides × 2 tickets per ride × $2 per ticket = $36

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying a ride bracelet.
Cost of a ride bracelet = $30

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets.
Amount saved = Cost of individual tickets - Cost of ride bracelet
Amount saved = $36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of individual tickets.
