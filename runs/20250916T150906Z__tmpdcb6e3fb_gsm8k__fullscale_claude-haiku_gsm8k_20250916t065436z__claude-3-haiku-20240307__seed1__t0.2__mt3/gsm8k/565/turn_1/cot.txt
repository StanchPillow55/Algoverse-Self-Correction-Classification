Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches in total.
- Cody ate a third of the sandwiches.
- Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.

Step 1: Calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches.
Cody's share = 1/3 × 12 = 4 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches.
Trevor's share = 1/4 × 12 = 3 sandwiches

Step 3: Calculate the number of sandwiches left.
Total sandwiches - Cody's share - Trevor's share = Sandwiches left
12 - 4 - 3 = 5 sandwiches

Therefore, the number of sandwiches left is 5.
