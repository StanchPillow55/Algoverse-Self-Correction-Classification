Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 Ã— 39 = 78 Junebugs each day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the 5 days.
Total Junebugs removed = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Step 3: Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day.
Average Junebugs removed per day = Total Junebugs removed / Number of days
Average Junebugs removed per day = 300 /
