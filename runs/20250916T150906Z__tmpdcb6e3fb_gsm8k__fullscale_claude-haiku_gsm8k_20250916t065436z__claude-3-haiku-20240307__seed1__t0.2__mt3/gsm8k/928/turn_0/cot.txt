To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of Junebugs removed by Rita over the five-day period and then calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day.

Given information:
- On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
- On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday.
- On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs.
- On Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 2 × 39 = 78 Junebugs per day
Total Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday = 78 × 2 = 156 Junebugs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of Junebugs removed over the five-day period.
Total Junebugs removed = Junebugs removed on Monday + Junebugs removed on Tuesday and Wednesday + Junebugs removed on
