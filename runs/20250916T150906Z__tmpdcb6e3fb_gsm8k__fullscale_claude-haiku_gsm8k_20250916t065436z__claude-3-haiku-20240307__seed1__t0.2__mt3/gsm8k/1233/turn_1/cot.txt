Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Walter bought 60 apples from the store.

2. He ate 2/5 of the apples:
   * 2/5 of 60 = 0.4 x 60 = 24 apples eaten

3. Remaining apples after he ate:
   * 60 - 24 = 36 apples

4. He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples:
   * 25% of 36 = 0.25 x 36 = 9 apples given to his sister

5. Remaining apples after giving to his sister:
   * 36 - 9 = 27 apples

6. He sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each:
   * 27 apples x $3 per apple = $81

Therefore, the amount of money Walter received from selling the remaining apples to his uncle is $81.
