Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Walter bought 60 apples from the store.
- He ate 2/5 of the apples.
- He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
- He then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Walter ate.
2/5 of 60 apples = 2/5 × 60 = 24 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate 24 apples.
Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36 apples

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister.
25% of 36 apples = 0.25 × 36 = 9 apples

Step 4: Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.
Remaining apples = 36 - 9 = 27 apples

Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Walter received from
