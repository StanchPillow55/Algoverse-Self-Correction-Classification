Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The water tank is initially filled with 120 liters of water.
- Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden.
- Celine was able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters.
Amount of water left in the tank = Initial amount of water - Amount of water used
Amount of water left in the tank = 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rainwater Celine collected.
Amount of rainwater collected = 2 × Amount of water left in the tank
Amount of rainwater collected = 2 × 30 liters = 60 liters

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.
Total amount of water in the tank = Amount of water left in the tank + Amount of rainwater collected
Total amount of water in the tank = 30 li
