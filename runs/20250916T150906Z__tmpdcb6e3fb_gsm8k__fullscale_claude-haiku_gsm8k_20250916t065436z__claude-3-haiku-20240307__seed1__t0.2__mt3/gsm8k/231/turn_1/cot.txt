Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, who collects 20 shells.
   * Robert collects 20 shells
   * Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert, so Kylie collects 20 + 5 = 25 shells

2. On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.
   * On Monday, Kylie collected 25 shells
   * On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more, so 2 x 25 = 50 shells

Therefore, the final answer is that Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.
