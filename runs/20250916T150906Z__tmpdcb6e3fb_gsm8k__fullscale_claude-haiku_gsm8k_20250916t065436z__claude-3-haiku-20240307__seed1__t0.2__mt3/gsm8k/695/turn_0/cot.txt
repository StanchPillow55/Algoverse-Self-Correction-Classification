Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 50 deer in the field.
- 50% of the deer are bucks.
- 20% of the bucks are 8 points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bucks in the field.
50% of 50 deer = 0.50 × 50 = 25 bucks

Step 2: Calculate the number of 8 point bucks.
20% of 25 bucks = 0.20 × 25 = 5 eight-point bucks

Therefore, the final answer is:
There are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.
