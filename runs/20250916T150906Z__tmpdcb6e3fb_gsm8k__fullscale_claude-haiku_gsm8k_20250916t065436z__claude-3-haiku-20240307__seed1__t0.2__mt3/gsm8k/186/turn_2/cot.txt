Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 3 cages of rats, with equal groups of rats in each cage.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each with one hamster.
- Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- There is a pen of rabbits where 20 pieces of straw are distributed.
- A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

To find the number of rats in each cage, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
2. Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
3. Subtract the total straw used for rats and hamsters from the total 160 pieces to get the straw used for the rabbits.
4. Divide the total straw used for the rats by the number of rats to get the number of rats in each cage.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the
