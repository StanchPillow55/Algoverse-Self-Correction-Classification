Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw
- 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits
- 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
Total pieces of straw for rats = Number of rats × 6 pieces per rat
Let's call the number of rats in each cage 'x'.
Total pieces of straw for rats = 3 × x × 6 = 18x

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
Total pieces of straw for hamsters = Number of hamsters × 5 pieces per hamster
Number of hamsters = 10 cages
Total pieces of straw for hamsters = 10 × 5 = 50

Step 3:
