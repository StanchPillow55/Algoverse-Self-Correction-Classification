To solve this problem, we need to find the number of rats in each cage.

Given information:
- The rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
- 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
- A total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the hamsters.
Number of hamster cages × Pieces of straw per hamster = Total pieces of straw for hamsters
10 × 5 = 50 pieces of straw

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rabbits.
20 pieces of straw

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of straw used for the rats.
Total pieces of straw distributed among small rodents - Pieces of straw for hamsters - Pieces of straw for rabbits = Pieces of straw
