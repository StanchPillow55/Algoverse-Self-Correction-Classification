To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services per day.
2. Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services per week.
3. Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services for the entire 5-week movie.
4. Apply the 10% discount to the total cost.
5. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services per day.
* The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
* It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
* Total cost per day = $250 × 6 hours = $1,500

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services per week.
* The makeup is required 4 times a week.
* Total cost per week = $1,500 × 4 = $6,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services for the entire 5-week movie.
* The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
* Total cost for the entire movie = $6,000
