Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts.
- Jake buys 2 T-shirts.
- The original price of each T-shirt is $8.
- Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.
- The original price of the shoes is $40.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts.
Since the store has a buy one get one 50% off deal, the cost of the 2 T-shirts will be:
- Cost of the first T-shirt: $8
- Cost of the second T-shirt: $8 × 0.5 = $4
Total cost of the T-shirts = $8 + $4 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes.
The shoes are 40% off the original price, so the discounted price will be:
Discounted price of the shoes = $40 × (1 - 0.4) = $40 ×
