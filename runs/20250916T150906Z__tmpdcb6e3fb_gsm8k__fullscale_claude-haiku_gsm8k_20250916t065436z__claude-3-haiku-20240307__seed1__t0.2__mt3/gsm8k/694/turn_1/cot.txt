Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that there are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
2. The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
3. There are 8 high chairs.

To find the number of regular chairs, we can use the information that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs:
* Number of regular chairs = 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs

Now, we need to find the total number of chairs needed for the 42 adults and 15 babies:
* Total chairs needed = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 chairs

Finally, we can calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get:
* Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Number of regular chairs
* Additional chairs needed = 57 - 40 = 17 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs to get 17 more chairs for the function.
