To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of chairs required for the function and then calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.

Given information:
- There will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
- There are 8 high chairs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people attending the function.
Total number of people = Number of adults + Number of babies
Total number of people = 42 + 15 = 57 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of regular chairs.
Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 × Number of high chairs
Number of regular chairs = 5 × 8 = 40 regular chairs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs required.
Total number of chairs required = Number of regular chairs + Number of high chairs
Total number of chairs required = 40 + 8 = 48 chairs

Step 4: Calculate the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.
Number of additional chairs needed = Total number
