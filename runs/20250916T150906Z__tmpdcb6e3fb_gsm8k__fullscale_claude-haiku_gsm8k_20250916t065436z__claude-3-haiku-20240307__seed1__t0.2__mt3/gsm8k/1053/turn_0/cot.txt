Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Alison bought a tank top for $10.
- She bought a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top.
- She bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price.
- She bought a package of athletic socks that cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the running shorts.
Cost of running shorts = Cost of tank top + $5
Cost of running shorts = $10 + $5 = $15

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the tennis shoes.
Original cost of tennis shoes = $48
Discounted price of tennis shoes = $48 รท 2 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the athletic socks.
Cost of athletic socks = $8 - $2 (coupon) = $6

Step 4: Calculate the total amount spent on athletic gear.
Total amount spent = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost
