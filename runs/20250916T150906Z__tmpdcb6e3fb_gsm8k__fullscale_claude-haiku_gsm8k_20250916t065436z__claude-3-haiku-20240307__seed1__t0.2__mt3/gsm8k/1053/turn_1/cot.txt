Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Alison bought a tank top for $10.
2. She bought a pair of running shorts that cost $5 more than the tank top, so the shorts cost $10 + $5 = $15.
3. She bought a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48, but were on sale for half price. So the tennis shoes cost $48 / 2 = $24.
4. She also bought a package of athletic socks that cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so the socks cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now let's add up all the costs:
* Tank top: $10
* Running shorts: $15
* Tennis shoes: $24
* Athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

Therefore, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is $55.
