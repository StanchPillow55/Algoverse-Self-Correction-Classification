Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.
- Each carton of ice cream has 15 servings.
- Each carton of ice cream costs $4.00.
- We need to find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.
Number of servings per day = 1
Number of days = 60
Total number of servings = 1 serving per day Ã— 60 days = 60 servings

Step 2: Calculate the number of cartons of ice cream Cynthia needs to buy.
Number of servings per carton = 15
Number of cartons needed = Total number of servings / Number of servings per carton
Number of cartons needed = 60 servings / 15 servings per carton = 4 cartons

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.
Cost per carton = $4.00
