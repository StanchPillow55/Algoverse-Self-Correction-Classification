Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he has to climb up.
- During the week, he made $105.

To find the average number of branches he climbed per day, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.
2. Divide the total number of branches by the number of days in a week (7).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches he climbed during the week.
Total amount earned during the week = $105
Cost per branch = $0.25
Total number of branches climbed = Total amount earned / Cost per branch
Total number of branches climbed = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.
Average number of branches climbed per day = Total number of branches climbed / Number of days in a week
Average number of branches climbed per day = 420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.
