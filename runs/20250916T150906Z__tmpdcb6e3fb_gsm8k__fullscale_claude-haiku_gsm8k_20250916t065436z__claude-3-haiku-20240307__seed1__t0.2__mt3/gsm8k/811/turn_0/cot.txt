To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he climbs.
- During the week, he made a total of $105.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
Total amount earned / Cost per branch = Total number of branches climbed
$105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day.
Total number of branches climbed / Number of days in a week = Average number of branches climbed per day
420 branches / 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.

Final answer: On average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.
