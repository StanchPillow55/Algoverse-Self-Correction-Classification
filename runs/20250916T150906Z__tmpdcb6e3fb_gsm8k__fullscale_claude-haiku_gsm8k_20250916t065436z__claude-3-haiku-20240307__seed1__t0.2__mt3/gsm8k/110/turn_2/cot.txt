Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for Beatrice.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice.
Total roll-ups eaten = Beatrice's roll-ups + Marcell's roll-ups
Total roll-
