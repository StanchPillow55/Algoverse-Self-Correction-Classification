Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-up was 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-up was 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

To find the average number of fruit roll-ups they ate, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person.
2. Add the total number of fruit roll-ups for both people.
3. Divide the total by 2 to find the average.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups for each person.
Beatrice's total: 2 roll-ups wide x 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups
Marcell's total: 3 roll-ups wide x 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups

Step 2: Add the total number of fruit roll-ups for both people.
Total fruit roll-ups = Beatrice's total + Marcell's total
Total fruit roll
