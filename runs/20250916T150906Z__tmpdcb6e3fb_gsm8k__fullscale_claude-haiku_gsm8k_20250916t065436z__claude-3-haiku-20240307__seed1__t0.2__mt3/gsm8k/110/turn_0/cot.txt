To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate, and then calculate the average.

Given information:
- Beatrice's fruit roll-ups were 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long.
- Marcell's fruit roll-ups were 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Beatrice ate.
Beatrice's fruit roll-ups = 2 roll-ups wide × 24 roll-ups long = 48 fruit roll-ups

Step 2: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell ate.
Marcell's fruit roll-ups = 3 roll-ups wide × 14 roll-ups long = 42 fruit roll-ups

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruit roll-ups that Marcell and Beatrice ate.
Total fruit roll-ups eaten = Beatrice's fruit roll-ups + Marcell's fruit roll-ups
Total fruit roll-ups eaten = 48
