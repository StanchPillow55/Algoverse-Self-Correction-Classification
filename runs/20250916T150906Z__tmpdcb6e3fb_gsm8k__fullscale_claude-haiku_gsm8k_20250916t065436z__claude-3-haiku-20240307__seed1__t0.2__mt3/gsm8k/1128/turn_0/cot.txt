To solve this problem, we need to find Vince's current age based on the given information about Liam's age.

Given information:
- Liam is 16 years old now.
- Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.

Step 1: Find Liam's age two years ago.
Liam's age two years ago = Liam's current age - 2 years
Liam's age two years ago = 16 - 2 = 14 years

Step 2: Find Vince's age two years ago.
Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we can use the following equation:
Liam's age two years ago = 2 × Vince's age two years ago
14 = 2 × Vince's age two years ago
Vince's age two years ago = 14 / 2 = 7 years

Step 3: Find Vince's current age.
Vince's current age = Vince's age two years ago + 2
