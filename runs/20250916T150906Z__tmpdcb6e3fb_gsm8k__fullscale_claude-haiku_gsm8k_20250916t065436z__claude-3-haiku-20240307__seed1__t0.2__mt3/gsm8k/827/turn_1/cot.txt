Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The book weighs 4 pounds
- The book cost $32
- The book needs to be returned to a distribution center 20 miles away
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound plus $0.08 per mile
- Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price

Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost.
Shipping cost per pound = $0.35
Shipping cost per mile = $0.08
Total shipping distance = 20 miles
Total shipping cost = (4 pounds × $0.35) + (20 miles × $0.08) = $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00

Step 2: Calculate the refund amount from Amazon.
Amazon refund = 75% of $32 = 0.75 × $32 = $24.00

Step 3: Calculate the total loss.
Total loss = Book cost - Amazon refund + Shipping cost
Total loss = $32 - $24.00 + $3.00
