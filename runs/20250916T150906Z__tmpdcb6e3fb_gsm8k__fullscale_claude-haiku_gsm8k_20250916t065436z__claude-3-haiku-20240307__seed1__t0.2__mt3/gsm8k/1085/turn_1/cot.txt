Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The crocodile grows 8 inches long in 4 years.

To find how many inches the crocodile will grow in 13 years, we need to find the growth rate per year and then multiply it by the number of years.

Step 1: Calculate the growth rate per year.
Growth rate per year = Total growth / Total time
Growth rate per year = 8 inches / 4 years
Growth rate per year = 2 inches per year

Step 2: Calculate the total growth in 13 years.
Total growth in 13 years = Growth rate per year × Number of years
Total growth in 13 years = 2 inches per year × 13 years
Total growth in 13 years = 26 inches

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.
