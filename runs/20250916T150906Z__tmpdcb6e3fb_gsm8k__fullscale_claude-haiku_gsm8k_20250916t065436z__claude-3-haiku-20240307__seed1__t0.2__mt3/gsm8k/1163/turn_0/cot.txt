To solve this problem, we need to find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days.

Given information:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- Tyrion goes out three times a day.

Step 1: Find the number of face masks Tyrion uses per day.
Number of face masks used per day = Number of times Tyrion goes out per day × Number of times he changes his face mask per outing
Number of face masks used per day = 3 × 2 = 6 face masks

Step 2: Find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days.
Number of face masks used every 2 days = Number of face masks used per day × Number of days
Number of face masks used every 2 days = 6 face masks × 2 days = 12 face masks

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.

Final answer: Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.
