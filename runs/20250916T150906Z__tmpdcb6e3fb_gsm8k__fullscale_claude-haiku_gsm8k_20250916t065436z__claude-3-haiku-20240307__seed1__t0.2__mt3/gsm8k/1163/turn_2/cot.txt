Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- Tyrion goes out three times a day.

To find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of face masks used per day.
2. Multiply the number of face masks used per day by 2 to get the number used every 2 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of face masks used per day.
Number of times Tyrion goes out per day × Number of face mask changes per outing = Number of face masks used per day
3 × 2 = 6 face masks used per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of face masks used every 2 days.
Number of face masks used per day × Number of days = Number of face masks used every 2 days
6 face masks per day × 2 days = 12 face masks used every 2 days

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.
