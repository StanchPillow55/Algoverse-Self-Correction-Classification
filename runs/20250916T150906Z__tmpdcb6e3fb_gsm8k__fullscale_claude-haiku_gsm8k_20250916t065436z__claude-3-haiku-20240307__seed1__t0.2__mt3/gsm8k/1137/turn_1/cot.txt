Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
- He has two mugs of water, one at 33 degrees and the other at an unknown temperature.
- He pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other mug into his water bottle.
- After mixing the two, he is now able to drink the water.

To find the minimum temperature of the second mug, we need to calculate the final temperature of the mixed water in the water bottle.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water in the water bottle.
Total water = 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug + 1 ounce from the other mug = 5 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total heat content of the water in the water bottle.
Heat content = (4 ounces × 33 degrees) + (1 ounce × unknown temperature)

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the unknown temperature.
Since
