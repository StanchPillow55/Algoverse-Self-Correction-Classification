To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water that, when mixed with the 33-degree water, results in a temperature that is at least 40 degrees.

Given information:
- Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees.
- One mug of water is 33 degrees.
- Donny pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and 1 ounce from the other bottle.
- After mixing the two, Donny is able to drink the water.

Step 1: Set up the equation to find the minimum temperature of the second bottle.
Let x be the temperature of the second bottle.

The total volume of the mixed water is 5 ounces (4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the other bottle).
The total heat content of the mixed water is the sum of the heat content of the two bottles.

Heat content = (Volume × Temperature)
Heat content = (4 × 33) + (1 × x) =
