Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jean has 30 lollipops.
- Jean eats 2 of the lollipops.
- Jean wants to package the remaining lollipops in bags, with 2 lollipops per bag.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops remaining after Jean eats 2.
Number of lollipops remaining = 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops

Step 2: Determine how many lollipops can be packaged in each bag.
Each bag will contain 2 lollipops.

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops.
Number of bags = Number of lollipops remaining / Number of lollipops per bag
Number of bags = 28 / 2 = 14 bags

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.

Final answer: Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
