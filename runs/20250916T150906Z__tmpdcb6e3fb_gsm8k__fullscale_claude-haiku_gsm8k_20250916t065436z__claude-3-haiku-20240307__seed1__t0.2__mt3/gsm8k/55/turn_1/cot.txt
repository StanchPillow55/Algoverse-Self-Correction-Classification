Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Jean starts with 30 lollipops.
2. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops, so now she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops remaining.
3. Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.
4. To calculate the number of bags Jean can fill, we need to divide the remaining lollipops by 2 (since each bag contains 2 lollipops).
5. 28 lollipops รท 2 lollipops per bag = 14 bags.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
