Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter's movie ticket costs $7
- Peter's popcorn costs $7
- Peter has $42 for the week

To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost of one movie trip and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of one movie trip.
Cost of movie ticket + Cost of popcorn = Total cost of one movie trip
$7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate how many times Peter can go to the movies.
Total amount of money / Total cost of one movie trip = Number of times Peter can go to the movies
$42 / $14 = 3 times

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.
