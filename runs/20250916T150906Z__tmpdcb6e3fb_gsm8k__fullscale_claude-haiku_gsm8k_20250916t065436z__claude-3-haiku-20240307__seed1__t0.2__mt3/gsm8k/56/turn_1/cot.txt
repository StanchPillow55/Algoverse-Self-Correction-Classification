Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter needs $7 for a movie ticket
- Peter needs $7 for popcorn
- Peter has $42 for the week

To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for each trip to the movies and then divide the total amount of money he has by the cost per trip.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost per trip to the movies.
Cost of movie ticket + Cost of popcorn = Total cost per trip
$7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the number of trips Peter can make to the movies.
Total amount of money / Total cost per trip = Number of trips
$42 / $14 = 3 trips

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Final answer: Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.
