To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with the $42 he has for the week.

Given information:
- Ticket price: $7
- Popcorn price: $7
- Total amount of money Peter has for the week: $42

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of one movie trip.
Cost of one movie trip = Ticket price + Popcorn price
Cost of one movie trip = $7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the number of times Peter can go to the movies.
Number of times Peter can go to the movies = Total amount of money / Cost of one movie trip
Number of times Peter can go to the movies = $42 / $14 = 3 times

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

Final answer: Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.
