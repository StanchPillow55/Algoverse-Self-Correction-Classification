Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 12 female lions
- There are half as many male lions as female lions
- There are 14 lion cubs

Step 1: Calculate the number of male lions.
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:
Number of male lions = 1/2 × Number of female lions
Number of male lions = 1/2 × 12 = 6 male lions

Step 2: Calculate the total number of lions in the enclosure.
Total number of lions = Number of female lions + Number of male lions + Number of lion cubs
Total number of lions = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions

Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 32.

Final answer: There are 32 lions in the enclosure.
