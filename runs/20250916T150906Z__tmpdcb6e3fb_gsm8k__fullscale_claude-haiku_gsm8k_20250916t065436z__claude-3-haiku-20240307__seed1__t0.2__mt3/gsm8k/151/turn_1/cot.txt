Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bicycles have 2 tires each.
   * 5 people with bicycles came by
   * Each bicycle has 2 tires
   * So, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is: 5 people x 2 tires = 10 tires

2. Tricycles have 3 tires each.
   * 3 people with tricycles came by
   * Each tricycle has 3 tires
   * So, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is: 3 people x 3 tires = 9 tires 

3. Unicycles have 1 tire each.
   * 1 person with a unicycle came by
   * The unicycle has 1 tire
   * So, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is: 1 person x 1 tire = 1 tire

4. Calculating the total revenue:
   * Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate
   * Total tires inflated = 10
