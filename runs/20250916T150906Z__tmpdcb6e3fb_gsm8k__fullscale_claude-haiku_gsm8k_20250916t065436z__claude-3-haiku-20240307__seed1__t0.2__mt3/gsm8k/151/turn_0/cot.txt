To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Shawnda made by inflating the tires of the bicycles, tricycles, and the unicycle.

Given information:
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated.
- 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
- 1 person came by on a unicycle.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the bicycles.
Number of bicycles × Number of tires per bicycle = Total number of tires inflated for bicycles
5 × 2 = 10 tires

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the tricycles.
Number of tricycles × Number of tires per tricycle = Total number of tires inflated for tricycles
3 × 3 = 9 tires

Step 3: Calculate the total number of tires inflated for the unicycle.
Number of unicycles × Number of tires per unicycle = Total number of tires inflate
