Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
- 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated.
- 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated.
- 1 person came by on a unicycle.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tires inflated.
Bicycles: 5 people x 2 tires per bicycle = 10 tires
Tricycles: 3 people x 3 tires per tricycle = 9 tires
Unicycle: 1 person x 1 tire per unicycle = 1 tire
Total tires inflated = 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from inflating the tires.
Cost per tire = $0.25
Total revenue = 20 tires x $0.25 per tire = $5.00

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 that day from her bike inflation service
