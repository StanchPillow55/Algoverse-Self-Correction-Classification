Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jade took 210 photos in total.
2. She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
3. She uploads 6 batches each day.

To find the number of days needed to upload all 210 photos, we need to calculate the total number of photos uploaded per day, and then divide the total number of photos by the daily upload.

Photos uploaded per day:
* 7 photos per batch x 6 batches per day = 42 photos per day

Total number of days needed:
* 210 total photos / 42 photos per day = 5 days

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 of her photos to Instagram.
