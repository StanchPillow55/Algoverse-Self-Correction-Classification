To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days Jade will need to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.

Given information:
- Jade took 210 photos in a week.
- She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of photos Jade can upload in one day.
Number of photos uploaded per day = Number of photos per batch × Number of batches per day
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7 × 6 = 42 photos

Step 2: Calculate the number of days needed to upload all 210 photos.
Number of days needed = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
Number of days needed = 210 / 42 = 5 days

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.

Final answer: Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.
