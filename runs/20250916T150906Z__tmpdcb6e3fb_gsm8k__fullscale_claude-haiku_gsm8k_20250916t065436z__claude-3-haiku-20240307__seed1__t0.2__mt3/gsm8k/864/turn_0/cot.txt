To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of burritos consumed and then subtract it from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos.

Given information:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
Number of burritos consumed by students = Number of students × Number of burritos per student
Number of burritos consumed by students = 50 × 10 = 500 burritos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.
Number of burritos consumed by Mr. George = 20 burritos

Step 3: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.
Total burritos consumed = Burritos consumed by students + Burritos consumed by Mr. George
Total burritos consumed = 500
