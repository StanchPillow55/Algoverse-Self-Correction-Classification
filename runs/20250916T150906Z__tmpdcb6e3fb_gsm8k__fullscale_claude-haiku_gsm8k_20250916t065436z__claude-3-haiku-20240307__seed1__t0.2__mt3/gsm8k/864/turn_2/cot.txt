Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
Number of students × Number of burritos per student = Total burritos given to students
50 students × 10 burritos per student = 500 burritos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of burritos eaten by Mr. George.
Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.
Total burritos given to students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George = Total burritos consumed
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Step 4: Calculate the number of leftover burritos.
Total burritos ordered - Total burritos consume
