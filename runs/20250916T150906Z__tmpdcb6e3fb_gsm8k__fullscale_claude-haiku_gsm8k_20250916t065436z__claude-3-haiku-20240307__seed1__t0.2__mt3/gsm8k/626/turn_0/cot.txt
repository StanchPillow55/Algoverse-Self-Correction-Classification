To solve this problem, we need to convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobytes per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h).

Given information:
- Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb/s.
- 1 Mb has 1000 kb.

Step 1: Convert the internet connection speed from kb/s to Mb/s.
1 Mb = 1000 kb
20 kb/s = 20 / 1000 Mb/s = 0.02 Mb/s

Step 2: Convert the internet connection speed from Mb/s to Mb/h.
1 hour = 3600 seconds
Mb/h = Mb/s × 3600 s/h
Mb/h = 0.02 Mb/s × 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.

Final answer: Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Mb per hour.
