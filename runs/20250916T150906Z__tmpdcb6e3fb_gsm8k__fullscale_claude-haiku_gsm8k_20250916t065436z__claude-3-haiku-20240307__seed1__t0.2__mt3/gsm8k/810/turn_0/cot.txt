Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month.
- There are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

To find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then find the difference between the final number and the initial 10 students.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month.
End of January: 10 × 2 = 20 students
End of February: 20 × 2 = 40 students
End of March: 40 × 2 = 80 students
End of April: 80 × 2 = 160 students
End of May: 160 × 2 = 320 students

Step 2: Find the difference between the final number of students (at the end of May) and the initial 10 students.
Final number of students - Initial number of students = Additional students
320 - 10
