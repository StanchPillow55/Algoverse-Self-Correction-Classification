Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. We start with 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

2. At the end of the first month (January), the number of students doubles, so there are now 20 students.

3. At the end of the second month (February), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 40 students.

4. At the end of the third month (March), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 80 students.

5. At the end of the fourth month (April), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 160 students.

6. At the end of the fifth month (May), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 320 students.

To find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students, we need to subtract the initial 10 students from the total number of students at the end of May:

320 students - 10 initial students = 310 additional students

Therefore, the final answer is that 310 additional students joined by the en
