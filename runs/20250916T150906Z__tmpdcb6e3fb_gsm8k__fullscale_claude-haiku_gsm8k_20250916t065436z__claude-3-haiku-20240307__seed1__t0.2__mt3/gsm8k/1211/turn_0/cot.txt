Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- For one medical dosage, Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
- We need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the second medicine.
Amount of the second medicine = 3 × 14 mL = 42 mL

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose.
Total amount of medicine in one dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.
Total amount of medicine in 8 doses = 8 × 56 mL = 448 mL

Therefore, the total amount of medicine in 8 doses would be 448 mL.

Final answer: 448 mL
