Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 90 single use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box with the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Pete can use the contacts from 2 boxes.
Contacts in 1 box = 90
Contacts in 2 boxes = 90 × 2 = 180
Days of use from 2 boxes = 45 days × 2 = 90 days

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Cost of 2 boxes = $90.00 × 2 = $180.00
