Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 90 single use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box of contacts after the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.
Number of contacts in 1 box = 90
Number of contacts in 2 boxes = 2 × 90 = 180 contacts
Number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes = 180 / 2 = 90 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Total cost of 2 boxes = 2 × $90.00 = $180
