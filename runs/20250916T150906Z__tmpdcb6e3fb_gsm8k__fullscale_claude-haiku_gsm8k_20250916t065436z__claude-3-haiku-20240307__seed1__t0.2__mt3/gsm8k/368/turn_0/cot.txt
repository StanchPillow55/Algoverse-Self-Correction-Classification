To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.

Given information:
- Erin scored 14 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Step 1: Find the total number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
Erin's total points = 3 × Sara's points
Erin's total points = 3 × 8 = 24 points

Step 2: Find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
Erin's points before scoring 14 = Erin's total points - 14
Erin's points before scoring 14 = 24 - 14 = 10 points

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

Final answer: Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.
