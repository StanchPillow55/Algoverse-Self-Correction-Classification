To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each.
- The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount spent by the baseball coach.
Total amount spent by the baseball coach = Number of baseballs × Cost per baseball
Total amount spent by the baseball coach = 9 × $3 = $27

Step 2: Calculate the total amount spent by the basketball coach.
Total amount spent by the basketball coach = Number of basketballs × Cost per basketball
Total amount spent by the basketball coach = 8 × $14 = $112

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the amount spent by the basketball coach and the baseball coach.
Difference in amount spent = Total amount spent by the basketball coach - Total amount spent by the baseball coach
Difference in amount spent = $112 - $27 = $85

Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

Final answer: The basketball coach spent $85
