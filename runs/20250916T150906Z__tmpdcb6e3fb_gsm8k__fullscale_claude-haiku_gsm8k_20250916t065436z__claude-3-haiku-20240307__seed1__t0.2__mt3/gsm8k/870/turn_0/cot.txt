Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Madeline and Keenan spend about $400 per month on groceries.
- Madeline pays 60% of the cost.
- The question is asking for how much Keenan spends per week in a four-week month.

Step 1: Calculate Madeline's monthly contribution.
Madeline's contribution = 60% of $400 = 0.60 Ã— $400 = $240

Step 2: Calculate Keenan's monthly contribution.
Keenan's contribution = Total monthly cost - Madeline's contribution
Keenan's contribution = $400 - $240 = $160

Step 3: Calculate Keenan's weekly contribution.
Keenan's weekly contribution = Keenan's monthly contribution / 4 weeks
Keenan's weekly contribution = $160 / 4 = $40

Therefore, in a four-week month, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.

Final answer: Keenan spends $40
