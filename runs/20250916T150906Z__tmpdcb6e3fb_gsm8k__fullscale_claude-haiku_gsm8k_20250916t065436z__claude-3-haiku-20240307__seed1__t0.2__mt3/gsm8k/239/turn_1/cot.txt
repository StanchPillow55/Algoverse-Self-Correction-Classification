Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The number of students in the school hall was 1000.
- The hall had 3 entrances/exits: A, B, and C.
- 30% of the students went out through exit A.
- 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B.
- The rest went out through exit C.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
30% of 1000 students = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A.
Remaining students = Total students - Students who went out through exit A
Remaining students = 1000 - 300 = 700 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) × 700 = 420 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.
Students who went out through exit C = Total
