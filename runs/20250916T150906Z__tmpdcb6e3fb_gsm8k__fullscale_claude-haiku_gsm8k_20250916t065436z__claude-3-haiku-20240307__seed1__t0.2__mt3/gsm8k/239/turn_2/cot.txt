Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total number of students in the hall is 1000.

2. 30% of the students went out through exit A.
   * 30% of 1000 = 0.30 x 1000 = 300 students went out through exit A.

3. The remaining students are 1000 - 300 = 700.

4. 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B.
   * 3/5 of 700 = 0.6 x 700 = 420 students went out through exit B.

5. The remaining students went out through exit C.
   * The remaining students = 700 - 420 = 280 students went out through exit C.

Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.
