To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Calculate the number of students who remained after exit A.
3. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
4. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
* 30% of 1000 students went out through exit A
* 30% of 1000 = 0.30 × 1000 = 300 students

Step 2: Calculate the number of students who remained after exit A.
* Total students - students who went out through exit A = remaining students
* 1000 - 300 = 700 students

Step 3: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B.
* 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B
* 3/5 of 700 = 0.6 × 700 = 420 students

Step 4: Calculate the number of students who went out through exit C.
