Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Marin eats 4 apples a day.
- Nancy eats 4 apples a day.
- We need to find the total number of apples they eat in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Marin eats in 30 days.
Marin's daily apple consumption = 4 apples
Marin's total apple consumption in 30 days = 4 apples × 30 days = 120 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples Nancy eats in 30 days.
Nancy's daily apple consumption = 4 apples
Nancy's total apple consumption in 30 days = 4 apples × 30 days = 120 apples

Step 3: Calculate the total number of apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days.
Total apples eaten = Marin's total apples + Nancy's total apples
Total apples eaten = 120 apples + 120 apples = 240
