To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and calculate the amount of Skyler's investment.

Given information:
- The total amount invested in the joint savings account is $1200.
- Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.
- Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount.
- Skyler's investment accounted for the rest.

Step 1: Calculate Dylan's investment.
Dylan's investment = 2/5 of the total amount
Dylan's investment = 2/5 × $1200 = $480

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.
Remaining amount = Total amount - Dylan's investment
Remaining amount = $1200 - $480 = $720

Step 3: Calculate Frances' investment.
Frances' investment = 2/3 of the remaining amount
Frances' investment = 2/3 × $720 = $480

Step 4: Calculate Skyler's investment.
Skyler's investment = Total amount - Dylan's investment - Frances' investment
Skyler's investment = $1200 - $480 -
