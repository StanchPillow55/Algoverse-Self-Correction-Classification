Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John wins an award at work with a one-time monetary reward of $5,000.
- The award also includes a 5% raise in his salary.
- John's current salary is $2,000 per week.
- John received the award on the first day of the year.

To calculate the total amount of money John made that year, we need to find the following:
1. His original annual salary before the raise.
2. The new annual salary after the 5% raise.
3. The total amount of money he made, including the one-time $5,000 reward.

Step 1: Calculate John's original annual salary before the raise.

Step 2: Calculate John's new annual salary after the 5% raise.
New annual salary = Original annual salary × (1 + 0.05)
New annual salary = $104,000 × 1.05 = $109,200

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money
