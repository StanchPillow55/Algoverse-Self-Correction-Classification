Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John wins an award at work with a one-time monetary reward of $5,000.
- The award also includes a 5% raise in his salary.
- John makes $2,000 per week.
- The award was given on the first day of the year.

Step 1: Calculate John's original annual salary.
John's original weekly salary = $2,000
John's original annual salary = $2,000 × 52 weeks = $104,000

Step 2: Calculate the new annual salary after the 5% raise.
New annual salary = Original annual salary + (Original annual salary × 0.05)
New annual salary = $104,000 + ($104,000 × 0.05)
New annual salary = $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200

Step 3: Calculate the total income for the year, including the one-time monetary reward.
Total income for the year = New annual salary + One-time monetary reward
Total income for the year = $109,200 + $5
