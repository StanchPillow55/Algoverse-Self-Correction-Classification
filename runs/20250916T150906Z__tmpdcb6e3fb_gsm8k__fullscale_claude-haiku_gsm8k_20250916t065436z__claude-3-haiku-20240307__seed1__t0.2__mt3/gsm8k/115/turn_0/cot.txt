To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought, the total revenue from selling the lumber, and then calculate the profit.

Given information:
- Sasha has 10 leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each.
- Sasha has 5 leftover 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.
- The prices for lumber have gone up by 50% since Sasha bought the lumber.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.
Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards × $10 per board = $100
Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards × $16 per board = $80
Total cost of lumber = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the new selling price of the lumber after the 50% increase.
New selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 × 1
