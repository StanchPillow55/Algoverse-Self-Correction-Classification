Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sasha bought 10 boards of 2 x 4 x 10 for $10 each.
- Sasha bought 5 boards of 4 x 4 x 10 for $16 each.
- The prices for lumber have gone up 50% since Sasha bought the boards.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the boards Sasha bought.
Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards x $10 per board = $100
Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards x $16 per board = $80
Total cost of all boards = $100 + $80 = $180

Step 2: Calculate the new selling price of the boards after the 50% increase.
New selling price of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = $10 x 1.5 = $15 per board
New selling price of 4 x 4 x 10 boards
