Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The farmer has 900 eggs.
- Each tray can hold 30 eggs.
- The farmer sells each tray for $2.5.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trays the farmer can make with 900 eggs.
Number of trays = Total number of eggs / Number of eggs per tray
Number of trays = 900 / 30 = 30 trays

Step 2: Calculate the total amount the farmer will earn by selling all the trays.
Total earnings = Number of trays × Price per tray
Total earnings = 30 × $2.5 = $75

Therefore, the farmer will earn $75 by selling all the trays.

Final answer: The farmer will earn $75 by selling all the trays.
