Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
2. During the day, the temperature was 45 degrees.
3. At night, the temperature is 33 degrees colder than during the day.
   * So the nighttime temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.
4. We need to raise the nighttime temperature from 12 degrees to at least 32 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.
   * The difference in temperature is 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.
5. Each log of wood burned raises the temperature by 5 degrees.
   * So we need to burn enough logs to raise the temperature by 20 degrees.
   * 20 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 4 logs.

Therefore, the final answer is that Carson needs to burn 4 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.
