To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum temperature inside the house during the night and then determine how many logs of wood Carson needs to burn to raise the temperature above 32 degrees.

Given information:
- The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
- Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees.
- It was 45 degrees during the day.
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature inside the house during the night.
Temperature during the day = 45 degrees
Temperature difference between day and night = 33 degrees
Temperature during the night = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the minimum temperature needed to prevent the pipes from freezing.
Minimum temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing = 32 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature increase needed to raise the temperature above 32 degrees.
Temperature increase needed = Minimum temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing - Temperature during the night
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12
