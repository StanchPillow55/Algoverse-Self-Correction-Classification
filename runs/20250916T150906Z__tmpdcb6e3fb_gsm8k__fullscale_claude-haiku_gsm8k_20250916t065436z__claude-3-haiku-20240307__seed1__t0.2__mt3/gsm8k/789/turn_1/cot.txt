Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees.
- Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees.
- It was 45 degrees during the day.
- It's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature during the night.
Temperature during the night = Temperature during the day - 33 degrees
Temperature during the night = 45 degrees - 33 degrees = 12 degrees

Step 2: Determine the minimum temperature needed to prevent the pipes from freezing.
Minimum temperature needed = 32 degrees (to prevent the pipes from freezing)

Step 3: Calculate the temperature increase needed to reach the minimum temperature.
Temperature increase needed = Minimum temperature needed - Temperature during the night
Temperature increase needed = 32 degrees - 12 degrees = 20 degrees

Step 4: Calculate the number of logs needed to increase the temperature by 20 degrees.
Temperature increase per log = 5 degrees
Number of logs neede
