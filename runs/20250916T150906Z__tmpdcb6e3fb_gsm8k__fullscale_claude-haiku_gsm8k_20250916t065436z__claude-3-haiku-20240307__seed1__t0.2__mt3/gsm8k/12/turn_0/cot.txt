To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it will take for the revenue from selling the lemons to exceed the cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree.

Given information:
- The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.
- The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
- The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons.
Annual revenue = Number of lemons per year × Price per lemon
Annual revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5

Step 2: Calculate the annual net profit from the lemon tree.
Annual net profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Annual net profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Step 3: Calculate the number of years it will take to recover the initial cost of planting the tree.
Initial cost / Annual net profit = Number of years
$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning
