To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in the vendor's daily and weekly expenses before and after the change in tomato suppliers.

Given information:
- The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor now buys tomatoes for $0.4 each.

Step 1: Calculate the vendor's daily expense before the change.
Daily expense before the change = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily expense before the change = 500 × $0.5 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the vendor's daily expense after the change.
Daily expense after the change = Number of tomatoes sold per day × New cost per tomato
Daily expense after the change = 500 × $0.4 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the daily savings.
Daily savings = Daily expense before the change - Daily expense after the change
Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings.
Weekly savings = Daily savings × Number of days in a week
Weekly savings = $50
