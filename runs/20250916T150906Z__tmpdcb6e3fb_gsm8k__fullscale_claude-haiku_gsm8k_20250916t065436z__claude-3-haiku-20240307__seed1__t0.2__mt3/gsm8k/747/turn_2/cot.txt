Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The vendor used to buy the tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The vendor now buys the tomatoes for $0.4 each.

Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of the tomatoes under the old vendor.
Daily cost = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily cost = 500 × $0.5 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the daily cost of the tomatoes under the new vendor.
Daily cost = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Cost per tomato
Daily cost = 500 × $0.4 = $200

Step 3: Calculate the daily savings by switching to the new vendor.
Daily savings = Old daily cost - New daily cost
Daily savings = $250 - $200 = $50

Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings by switching to the new vendor.
Weekly savings = Daily savings × Number of days in a week
Weekly savings = $50 × 7 = $350

Therefore,
