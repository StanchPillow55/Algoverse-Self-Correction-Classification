Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
2. The bag is 300g and has 5 servings.
3. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories.
4. To find how many grams you can eat, we need to first calculate the total calories in the bag of chips.
5. Total calories in the bag = 250 calories per serving x 5 servings = 1250 calories.
6. Now, we need to find out how many calories you have left to consume for the day.
7. Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories, so you have 200 calories left.
8. To find how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to divide the remaining 200 calories by the calorie density of the chips, which is 250 calories per serving.
9. 200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.
