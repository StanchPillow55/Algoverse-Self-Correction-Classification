Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
- A 300g bag has 5 servings.
- Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.
- You have already consumed 1800 calories.

Step 1: Calculate the total calories in the 300g bag of chips.
Total calories in the bag = Calories per serving × Number of servings
Total calories in the bag = 250 calories × 5 servings = 1250 calories

Step 2: Calculate the remaining calories you can consume for the day.
Remaining calories = Daily calorie target - Calories already consumed
Remaining calories = 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Step 3: Calculate the maximum amount of chips you can eat to stay within your remaining calorie target.
Maximum grams of chips = (Remaining calories / Calories per serving) × Grams per bag
Maximum grams of chips = (200 calories / 250 calories per serving) × 300 grams
Maximum grams of
