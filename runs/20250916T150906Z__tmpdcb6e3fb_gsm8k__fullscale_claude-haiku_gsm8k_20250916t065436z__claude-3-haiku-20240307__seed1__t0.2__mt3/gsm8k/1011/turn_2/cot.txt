Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons.
- On the first day:
  - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water.
  - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
- On the second day:
  - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day.
  - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day.
1/4 of 18,000 gallons = 0.25 × 18,000 = 4,500 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so:
3/4 × 4,500 gallons = 3,375 gallons
