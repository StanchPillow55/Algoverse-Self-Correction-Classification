Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on weekends, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays.
Number of weekdays = 5 (Monday to Friday)
Number of carrots per weekday = 4
Total carrots eaten on weekdays = 5 days × 4 carrots per day = 20 carrots

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends.
Number of weekend days = 2 (Saturday and Sunday)
Number of carrots per weekend day = 5
Total carrots eaten on weekends = 2 days × 5 carrots per day = 10 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats
