Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on weekends, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays.
Number of carrots per weekday × Number of weekdays = Total carrots on weekdays
4 carrots × 5 days = 20 carrots

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends.
Number of carrots per weekend day × Number of weekend days = Total carrots on weekends
5 carrots × 2 days = 10 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week.
Total carrots on weekdays + Total carrots on weekends = Total carrots per week
20 carrots + 10
