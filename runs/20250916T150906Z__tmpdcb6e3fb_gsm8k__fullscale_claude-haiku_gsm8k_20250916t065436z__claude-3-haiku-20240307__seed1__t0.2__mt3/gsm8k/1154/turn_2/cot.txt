Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays.
   * There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday through Friday).
   * So, on weekdays, he eats:
     * 4 carrots x 5 days = 20 carrots

2. Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.
   * There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
   * So, on weekends, he eats:
     * 5 carrots x 2 days = 10 carrots

3. To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the weekday and weekend amounts:
   * 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30 carrots.
