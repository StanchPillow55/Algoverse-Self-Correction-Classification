Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
- Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.
- John ate half the amount Thomas ate.

Step 1: Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate.
Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × 2 = 6 hot dogs

Step 2: Calculate how many hot dogs John ate.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate.
John's hot dogs = 1/2 × Thomas's hot dogs
John's hot dogs = 1/2 × 6 = 3 hot dogs

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of hot dogs John ate and the number of hot dogs Luke ate.
Difference = John's hot dogs - Luke's hot dogs
Difference = 3 - 2 = 1 hot dog

Therefore, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

Final answer: John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.
