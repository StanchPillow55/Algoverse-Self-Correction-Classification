Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.
- He drives at a speed of 70 mph.
- The detour added 10 miles to his trip.
- On the way back, the route is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip to his friend's house.
Original distance = 200 miles
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive to his friend's house.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time of the trip.
Total time = Time to friend's
