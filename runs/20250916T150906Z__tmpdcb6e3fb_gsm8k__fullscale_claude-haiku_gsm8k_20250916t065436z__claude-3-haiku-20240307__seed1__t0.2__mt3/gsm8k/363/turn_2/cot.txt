Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John drives 200 miles to his friend's house
- He drives at a speed of 70 mph
- The detour added 10 miles to his trip
- On the way back, the route is 240 miles and he drives at 80 mph

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip to his friend's house.
Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive to his friend's house.
Time to drive to friend's house = Total distance / Speed
Time to drive to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Total distance back home = 240 miles
Time to drive back home = Total distance / Speed
Time to drive back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time for the trip.
Total time for the trip = Time to drive
