To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house and then back home.

Given information:
- Distance to friend's house: 200 miles
- Speed to friend's house: 70 mph
- Detour distance: 10 miles
- Distance back home: 240 miles
- Speed back home: 80 mph

Step 1: Calculate the total distance to the friend's house.
Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive to the friend's house.
Time to friend's house = Total distance to friend's house / Speed to friend's house
Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Time back home = Distance back home / Speed back home
Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time for the trip.
Total time for the trip = Time to friend's
