To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations and solve for the amount of water in the small pool.

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks that are emptying them at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let y be the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the information that the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago.
y = 2x

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the information that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.
y - 4 × 4 = x - 4 × 4
y - 16 = x - 16
y = x

Step 3: Substitute the second equation into the first equation to
