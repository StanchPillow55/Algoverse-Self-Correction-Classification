Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks emptying them at 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons)
- Let 2x = the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago
- Let 4x = the amount of water in the big pool now

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water lost in 4 minutes.
Both pools are losing water at 4 gallons/minute.
Water lost in 4 minutes = 4 gallons/minute Ã— 4 minutes = 16 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
Small pool 4 minutes ago = x + 16 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago.
Big pool
