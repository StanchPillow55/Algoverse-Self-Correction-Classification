Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- We need to find how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the plane's speed.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it would take to travel the additional 2000 miles.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Time = 5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the additional time needed to travel the additional 2000 miles.
Additional time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles.
