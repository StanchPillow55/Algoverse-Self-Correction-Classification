To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the plane and then use it to calculate the additional time required to travel the additional 2000 miles.

Given information:
- The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours.
- We need to find the additional time required to travel an additional 2000 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the plane.
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 1200 miles / 3 hours
Speed = 400 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the additional time required to travel the additional 2000 miles.
Additional time = Additional distance / Speed
Additional time = 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour
Additional time = 5 hours

Therefore, it would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles at the same rate.

Final answer: It would take the plane an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles.
