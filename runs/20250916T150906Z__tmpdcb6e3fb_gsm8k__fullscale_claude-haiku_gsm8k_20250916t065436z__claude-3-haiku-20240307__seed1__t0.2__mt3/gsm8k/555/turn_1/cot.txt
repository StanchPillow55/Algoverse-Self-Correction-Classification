Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John gets paid $2 per hour.
2. He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.
3. He wants to save $80.

To calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80, we need to find out how much he earns per week and then divide the target savings by that amount.

Earnings per week:
* Hourly rate: $2 per hour
* Hours per day: 5 hours
* Days per week: 4 days
* Earnings per week = $2 x 5 hours x 4 days = $40 per week

Now, to find the number of weeks:
* Target savings: $80
* Earnings per week: $40
* Weeks needed = $80 / $40 = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
