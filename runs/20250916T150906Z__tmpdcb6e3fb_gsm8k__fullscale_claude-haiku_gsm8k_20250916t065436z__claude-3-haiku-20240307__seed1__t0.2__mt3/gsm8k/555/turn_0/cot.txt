To solve this problem, we need to find out how much money John earns per week and then calculate the number of weeks it will take him to save $80.

Given information:
- John gets paid $2 per hour.
- He works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.
- He wants to save $80.

Step 1: Calculate John's daily earnings.
Daily earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked per day
Daily earnings = $2 × 5 hours = $10

Step 2: Calculate John's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = Daily earnings × Days worked per week
Weekly earnings = $10 × 4 days = $40

Step 3: Calculate the number of weeks it will take John to save $80.
Number of weeks = Target savings / Weekly earnings
Number of weeks = $80 / $40 = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.

Final answer: It will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
