Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour
- WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour
- Each widget sells for $6
- The machines run 24 hours a day for 30 days

Step 1: Calculate the number of widgets made per day by each machine.
Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1,440 widgets/day
WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day = 1,080 widgets/day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of widgets made by each machine in 30 days.
Widgeteer 3000: 1,440 widgets/day x 30 days = 43,200 widgets
WidgetMaster 9000: 1,080 widgets/day x 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue generated by each machine in 30 days.
