Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Widgeteer 3000 production:
   * Produces 60 widgets per hour
   * Runs for 24 hours per day
   * Runs for 30 days in a month
   * Total widgets produced = 60 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days = 43,200 widgets

2. WidgetMaster 9000 production:
   * Produces 45 widgets per hour
   * Runs for 24 hours per day
   * Runs for 30 days in a month
   * Total widgets produced = 45 widgets/hour x 24 hours/day x 30 days = 32,400 widgets

3. Revenue calculation:
   * Each widget sells for $6
   * Widgeteer 3000 revenue = 43,200 widgets x $6/widget = $259,200
   * WidgetMaster 9000 revenue = 32,400 widgets x $6/widget = $194,400
