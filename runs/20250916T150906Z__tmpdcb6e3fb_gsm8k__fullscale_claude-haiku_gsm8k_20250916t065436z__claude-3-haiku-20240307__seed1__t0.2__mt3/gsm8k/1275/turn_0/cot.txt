To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children, and then calculate the force required to move the car.

Given information:
- The car weighs 1200 pounds.
- The luggage in the car weighs 250 pounds.
- The two young children in the car weigh 75 pounds each.
- The force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.
Total weight = Weight of the car + Weight of the luggage + Weight of the children
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + (2 × 75 pounds)
Total weight = 1200 pounds + 250 pounds + 150 pounds
Total weight = 1600 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the force required to move the car.
Force required = 1% of the total weight
Force required = 0.01 × 1600 pounds
Force required = 16 pounds

Therefore, the force John needs to push the car is 16 pounds.
