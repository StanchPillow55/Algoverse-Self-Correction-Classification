To solve this problem, we need to find the number of face masks Johnny bought based on the given information.

Given information:
- Mike bought 5 face masks.
- Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.

Step 1: Find the number of face masks Johnny bought.
Number of face masks Johnny bought = (3 × Mike's face masks) + 2
Number of face masks Johnny bought = (3 × 5) + 2
Number of face masks Johnny bought = 15 + 2
Number of face masks Johnny bought = 17

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.
