Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alicia's weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants, and 1 skirt.
- The dry cleaner charges $5.00 per blouse, $6.00 per skirt, and $8.00 per pair of pants.
- We need to find the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Alicia's weekly dry-cleaning.
Cost of 5 blouses: 5 × $5.00 = $25.00
Cost of 2 pants: 2 × $8.00 = $16.00
Cost of 1 skirt: 1 × $6.00 = $6.00
Total weekly cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of dry-cleaning for 5 weeks.
Total cost for 5 weeks = Weekly cost × 5 weeks
