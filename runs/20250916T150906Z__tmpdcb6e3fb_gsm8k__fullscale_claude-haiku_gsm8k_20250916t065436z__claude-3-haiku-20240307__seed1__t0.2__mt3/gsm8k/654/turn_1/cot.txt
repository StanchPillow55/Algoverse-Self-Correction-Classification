Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
2. Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
3. Lori is inviting 16 guests to her party.

To calculate the total number of deviled egg halves needed:
* Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves
* 16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves = 48 deviled egg halves

Now, to calculate the number of whole eggs needed:
* Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves
* 48 deviled egg halves / 2 = 24 whole eggs

Finally, to convert to dozens:
* 24 whole eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs for her party.
