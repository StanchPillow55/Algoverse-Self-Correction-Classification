To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of deviled egg halves required for the party and then calculate the number of whole eggs needed to make them. Finally, we can convert the number of eggs to dozens.

Given information:
- Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves.
- Each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves.
- Lori is inviting 16 guests to the party.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required for the party.
Number of deviled egg halves per guest × Number of guests = Total number of deviled egg halves
3 deviled egg halves × 16 guests = 48 deviled egg halves

Step 2: Calculate the number of whole eggs needed to make the deviled egg halves.
Total number of deviled egg halves ÷ 2 = Number of whole eggs needed
48 deviled egg halves ÷ 2 = 24 whole eggs

Step 3: Convert the number of eggs to dozens.
Number of whole eggs ÷
