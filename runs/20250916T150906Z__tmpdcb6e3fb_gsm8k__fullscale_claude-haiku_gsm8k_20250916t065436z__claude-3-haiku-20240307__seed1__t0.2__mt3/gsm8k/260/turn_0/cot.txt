Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies.
- Carla is making 36 cookies today.
- Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of flour needed for the cookies made today.
Cookies made today = 36
Flour needed for 1 dozen (12) cookies = 2 cups
Flour needed for 36 cookies = (36 ÷ 12) × 2 = 6 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour needed for the cookies made tomorrow.
Cookies made tomorrow = 30
Flour needed for 1 dozen (12) cookies = 2 cups
Flour needed for 30 cookies = (30 ÷ 12) × 2 = 5 cups

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for the cookies made today and tomorrow.
Total flour needed = Flour needed for cookies made today + Flour needed for cookies made tomorrow
Total flour needed = 6 cups
