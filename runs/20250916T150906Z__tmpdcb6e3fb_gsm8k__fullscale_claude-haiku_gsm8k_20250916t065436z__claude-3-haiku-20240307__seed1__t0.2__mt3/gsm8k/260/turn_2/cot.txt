Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies.
2. Carla is making 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow.
3. To find the total number of cookies Carla is making, we add the cookies for today and tomorrow:
   * 36 cookies + 30 cookies = 66 cookies

4. Now we need to find how many dozens of cookies that is:
   * 66 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.5 dozens

5. Since we can't have a partial dozen, we round up to 6 dozens.

6. To find the total cups of flour needed, we multiply the number of dozens (6) by the 2 cups of flour per dozen:
   * 6 dozens x 2 cups/dozen = 12 cups of flour

Therefore, Carla will need 12 cups of flour to bake the 36 cookies today and the 30 cookies tomorrow.
