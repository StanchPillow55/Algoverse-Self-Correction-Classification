Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10,000
- Gabriel wants to buy a phone for $800
- Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends
- Gabriel's brother gave him $200 to help him

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the car and phone.
Total cost = Cost of car + Cost of phone
Total cost = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel has.
Money from working on weekends = $5,000
Money from brother = $200
Total money Gabriel has = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Gabriel still needs.
Money still needed = Total cost - Total money Gabriel has
Money still needed = $10,800 - $5,200 = $5,600

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy the car and phone.

Final answer: Gabriel still needs $5,600.
