Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three possible scenarios that could happen:
   a. Substitute teacher (50% chance)
   b. Normal teacher with class extension (40% chance)
   c. Normal teacher without class extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension (20% chance)

2. To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the one scenario where he doesn't get an extension.

3. Scenario A (Substitute teacher): If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so this scenario does not contribute to the final probability.

4. Scenario B (Normal teacher with class extension): If the normal teacher comes in and gives the class an extension, Marcus also does not have to turn in his homework, so this scenario also does not contribute to the final probability.

5. Scenario C (Normal teacher without class extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension): This is the only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework.

6. The probability of this scenario is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the percentage chance that
