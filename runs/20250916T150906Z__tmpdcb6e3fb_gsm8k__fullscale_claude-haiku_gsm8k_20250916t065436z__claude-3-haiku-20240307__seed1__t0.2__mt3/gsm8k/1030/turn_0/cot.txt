To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework tomorrow.

Given information:
- There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
- Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
- Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework.
Probability of having a substitute teacher = 50% = 0.5
Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension = 40% = 0.4
Probability of getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.2

Probability of not having to turn in homework = Probability of having a substitute teacher + Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension + Probability of getting a personal extension
Probability of not having to turn in homework = 0.5 + (0.4 × 0.5) + (0.2 × 0.6)
