Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three possible scenarios that could happen:
   a. Substitute teacher comes in (50% chance)
   b. Normal teacher comes in, but gives an extension (40% chance)
   c. Normal teacher comes in, no extension, but Marcus convinces the teacher (20% chance)

2. Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:
   a. Substitute teacher comes in (50% chance): 
      - This means Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so the probability is 50%.
   b. Normal teacher comes in, but gives an extension (40% chance):
      - This also means Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so the probability is 40%.
   c. Normal teacher comes in, no extension, but Marcus convinces the teacher (20% chance):
      - This is the only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework.

3. To calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to add up the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to turn it in, and subtract that from 100
