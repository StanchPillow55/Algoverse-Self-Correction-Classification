Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.
- The starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.
- The resulting value was then multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

Step 1: Find the value of the number train after the first operation.
Starting value + (1/2 × starting value) = 20 + (1/2 × 20) = 20 + 10 = 30
Value after the first operation = 30 ÷ 5 = 6

Step 2: Find the value of the number train after the second operation.
Starting value - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
Final value = 6 × 8 = 48

Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.
