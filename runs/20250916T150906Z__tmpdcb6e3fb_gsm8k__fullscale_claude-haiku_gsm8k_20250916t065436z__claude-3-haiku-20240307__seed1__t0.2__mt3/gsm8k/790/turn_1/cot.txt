Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. There were 90 people total who needed to be split into groups.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9):
   * 90 รท 9 = 10 groups

4. Now, we need to find how many of those 10 groups had 3/5 of the members bring back 2 seashells each.
   * 3/5 of 10 groups = 6 groups

5. Each of those 6 groups had 2 seashells brought back by 3/5 of the 9 members.
   * 3/5 of 9 = 5.4 (rounded to 5 members per group)
   * 5 members x 2 seashells each = 10 seashells per group
   * 10 seashells per group x 6 groups = 60 se
