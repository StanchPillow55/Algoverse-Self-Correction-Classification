Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people in each group:
   * Number of groups = 90 / 9 = 10 groups

4. Now, we are told that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each.
5. To find the number of groups that had members bring back 2 seashells each, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:
   * Number of groups with 2 seashells each = 10 * 3/5 = 6 groups

6. Finally, to find the total number of seashells brought back, we multiply the number of groups with 2 seashells each by the number of seashells each member brought back:
   * Total number of seashells = 6 groups * 2 seashells
