To solve this problem, we need to find the number of times the alarm rang for each of the three instances and then add them up to get the total number of times the alarm rang.

Given information:
- The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
- The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time.
- The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time.

Step 1: Find the number of times the alarm rang the second time.
Number of times the alarm rang the second time = 3 ร 4 = 12 times

Step 2: Find the number of times the alarm rang the third time.
Number of times the alarm rang the third time = 12 รท 2 = 6 times

Step 3: Find the total number of times the alarm rang.
Total number of times the alarm rang = 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times

Therefore, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.
