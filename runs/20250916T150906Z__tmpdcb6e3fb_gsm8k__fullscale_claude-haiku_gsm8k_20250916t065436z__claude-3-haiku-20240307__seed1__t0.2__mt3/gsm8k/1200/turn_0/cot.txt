Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40.

Let's represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x.

Step 1: Write an equation to represent the given information.
Four times the number of coffee mugs + 8 = 40
4x + 8 = 40

Step 2: Solve the equation for x.
4x + 8 = 40
4x = 32
x = 8

Step 3: Interpret the final answer.
The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 8.

Therefore, the final answer is:
There are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.
