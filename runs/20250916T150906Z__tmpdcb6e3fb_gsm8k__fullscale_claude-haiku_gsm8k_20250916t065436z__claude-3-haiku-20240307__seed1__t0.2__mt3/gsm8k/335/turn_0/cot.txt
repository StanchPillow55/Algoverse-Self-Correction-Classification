Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers.
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge.
- Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for the 8 batches of suckers.
Sugar needed for 1 batch of suckers = 30 ounces
Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers = 8 Ã— 30 ounces = 240 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for the 1 batch of fudge.
Sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge = 70 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of sugar needed for all the batches.
Total sugar needed = Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers + Sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge
Total sugar needed = 240 ounces + 70
