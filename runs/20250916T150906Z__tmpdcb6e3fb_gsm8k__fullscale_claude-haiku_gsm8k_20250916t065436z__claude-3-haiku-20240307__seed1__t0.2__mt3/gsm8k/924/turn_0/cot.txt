To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Given information:
- It takes the sloth 4 hours to make the trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up.
- The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.

Step 1: Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.
Number of trips = Total time / Time per trip
Number of trips = 8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

Step 2: Calculate the number of berries the sloth needs to pick up per trip.
Total berries needed / Number of trips = Berries per trip
24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries per trip

Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground to collect 24 berries in 8 hours is 12 berries.

Final answer: The sloth needs to pick up at least 12
