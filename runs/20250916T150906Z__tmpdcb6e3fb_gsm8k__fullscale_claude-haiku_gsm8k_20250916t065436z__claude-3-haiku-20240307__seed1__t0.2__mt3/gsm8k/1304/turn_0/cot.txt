Given information:
- Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students every year.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School.

Step 1: Find the average enrollment at Butler High School.
Average enrollment at Butler High School = 3/4 × Average enrollment at Norman High School
