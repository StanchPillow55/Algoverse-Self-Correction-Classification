Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- Derrick sells each doughnut for $2.
- We need to find how much money Derrick makes in June.

Step 1: Convert the number of doughnuts made per day from dozens to individual doughnuts.
1 dozen = 12 doughnuts
10 dozen doughnuts per day = 10 × 12 = 120 doughnuts per day

Step 2: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
June has 30 days.
Total doughnuts made in June = 120 doughnuts per day × 30 days = 3,600 doughnuts

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue Derrick makes by selling all the doughnuts.
Revenue per doughnut = $2
Total revenue in June = 3,600 doughnuts × $2 per doughnut = $7,200

Therefore,
