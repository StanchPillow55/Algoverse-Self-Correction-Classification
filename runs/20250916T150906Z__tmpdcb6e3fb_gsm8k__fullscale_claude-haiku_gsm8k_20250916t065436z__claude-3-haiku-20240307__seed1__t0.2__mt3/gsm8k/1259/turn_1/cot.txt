Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Derrick's bakery makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
- Derrick sells each doughnut for $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June.
There are 30 days in June.
Total doughnuts made in June = 10 dozen per day × 30 days
Total doughnuts made in June = 10 × 12 × 30 = 3,600 doughnuts

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Derrick makes by selling all the doughnuts.
Revenue per doughnut = $2
Total revenue in June = 3,600 doughnuts × $2 per doughnut
Total revenue in June = $7,200

Therefore, the amount of money Derrick makes in June by selling all the doughnuts is $7,200.
