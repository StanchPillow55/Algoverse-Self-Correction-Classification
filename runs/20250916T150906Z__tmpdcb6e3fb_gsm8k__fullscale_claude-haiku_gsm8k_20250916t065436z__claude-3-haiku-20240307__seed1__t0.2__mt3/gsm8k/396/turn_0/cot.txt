Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices total.

2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill.
   * 1/3 of 12 slices = 4 slices

3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.
   * 1/4 of 12 slices = 3 slices

4. Jenny eats 2 slices.

Now, let's calculate the total number of slices taken:
* Bill's slices: 4
* Mark's slices: 3
* Jenny's slices: 2
* Total slices taken: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9

To find the number of slices left, we take the total number of slices (12) and subtract the number of slices taken (9):
* Slices left = 12 - 9 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is that 3 slices of pizza are left.
