Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount.

Step 1: Find the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some to her friend.
1/4 of the original amount = 1/4 Ã— 20 = 5 pomelos

Step 2: Find the number of pomelos Eve gave away.
Original amount - Amount left = Amount given away
20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos to her friend.

Final answer: Eve gave away 15 pomelos.
