Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- She feeds her cats twice a day with 60 grams of cat food.
- Imma has 720 grams of cat food.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed by the 3 cats per day.
Amount of cat food per cat per feeding × Number of feedings per day × Number of cats = Total amount of cat food consumed per day
60 grams × 2 feedings × 3 cats = 360 grams of cat food consumed per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of days the 720 grams of cat food will last.
Total amount of cat food / Total amount of cat food consumed per day = Number of days the cat food will last
720 grams / 360 grams per day = 2 days

Therefore, the 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.

Final answer: The 720 grams of cat food will last for 2 days.
