Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Quinn is 30 years old.

Step 1: Find Jane's age.
Quinn's age = 30 years
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3 years
Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27 years

Step 2: Find Trent's age.
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5 years
Trent's age = 27 + 5 = 32 years

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.
