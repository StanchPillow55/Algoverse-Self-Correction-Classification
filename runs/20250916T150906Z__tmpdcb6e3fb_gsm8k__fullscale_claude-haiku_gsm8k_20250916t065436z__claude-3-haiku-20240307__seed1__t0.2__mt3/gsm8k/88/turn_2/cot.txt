Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
- They sold 88,000 copies combined.

Let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as "x".

Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent Marilyn's sales as "10x".

The total number of copies sold is the sum of Marilyn's and Harald's sales:
Marilyn's sales + Harald's sales = Total copies sold
10x + x = 88,000

Simplifying the equation:
11x = 88,000
x = 88,000 / 11
x = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

Final answer: Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.
