Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The basketball game has 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long.
   * 4 quarters x 12 minutes per quarter = 48 minutes

2. In the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended for 5 minutes.
   * 48 minutes (for the 4 regular quarters) + 5 minutes (for the overtime) = 53 minutes

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.
