Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.
- Jenna's mom got 20 apples.

Step 1: Find how many apples Jenna picked.
Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, we can use the following equation:
Jenna's apples = 1/2 × Mom's apples
Jenna's apples = 1/2 × 20 = 10 apples

Step 2: Find the total number of apples they both picked.
Total apples picked = Jenna's apples + Mom's apples
Total apples picked = 10 + 20 = 30 apples

Therefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples.

Final answer: Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples.
