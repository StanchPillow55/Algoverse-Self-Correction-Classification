Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mario has 6 sled dogs.
2. Each sled dog has 4 legs.
3. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total number of legs that need snowshoes, and then multiply that by the cost per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs that need snowshoes.
Total number of legs = 6 dogs x 4 legs per dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs needed.
Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = 12 pairs x $12.00 per pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all 6 of his
