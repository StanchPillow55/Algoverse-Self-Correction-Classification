Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mario has 6 sled dogs
- Each dog has 4 legs
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00

To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs
Number of dogs × Number of legs per dog = Total number of legs
6 dogs × 4 legs per dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Total number of legs / Number of legs per pair of snowshoes = Number of pairs of snowshoes needed
24 legs / 4 legs per pair = 6 pairs of snowshoes

Step 3: Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair
Number of pairs × Cost per pair = Total cost
6 pairs × $12.00 per pair = $72.
