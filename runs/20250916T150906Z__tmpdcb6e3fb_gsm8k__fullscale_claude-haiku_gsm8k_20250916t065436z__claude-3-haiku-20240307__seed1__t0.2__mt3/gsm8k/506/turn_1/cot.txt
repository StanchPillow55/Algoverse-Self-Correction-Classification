Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mario has 6 sled dogs
- Each sled dog has 4 legs
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00

To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the sled dogs
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
3. Multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the sled dogs
Number of sled dogs × Number of legs per dog = Total number of legs
6 × 4 = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Total number of legs / Number of legs per pair of snowshoes = Number of pairs of snowshoes needed
24 legs / 4 legs per pair = 6 pairs of snowshoes

Step 3: Multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair
Number of pairs of snowshoes × Cost per pair = Total cost
