Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The sessions cost $125 per hour.

To find the total cost of the physical therapy, we need to calculate the total number of hours and then multiply it by the cost per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours of physical therapy.
Number of weeks = 6
Number of sessions per week = 2
Number of hours per session = 2
Total number of hours = 6 weeks × 2 sessions per week × 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy.
Cost per hour = $125
Total cost = Total number of hours × Cost per hour
Total cost = 24 hours × $125 per hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of the physical therapy for John was $3,000.
