To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy and then multiply it by the cost per hour to get the total cost.

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The cost of each session is $125 per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
Number of weeks × Number of sessions per week × Number of hours per session = Total number of hours
6 weeks × 2 sessions per week × 2 hours per session = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy.
Total number of hours × Cost per hour = Total cost
24 hours × $125 per hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy was $3,000.
