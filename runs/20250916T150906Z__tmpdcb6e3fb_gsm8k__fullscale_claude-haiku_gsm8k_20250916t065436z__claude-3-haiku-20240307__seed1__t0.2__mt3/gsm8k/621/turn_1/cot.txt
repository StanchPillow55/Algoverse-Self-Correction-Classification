Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
- Each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
- The sessions cost $125 per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy.
Number of sessions per week = 2 times
Number of hours per session = 2 hours
Number of weeks = 6 weeks
Total number of hours = 2 sessions/week × 2 hours/session × 6 weeks = 24 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the physical therapy sessions.
Cost per hour = $125
Total cost = Total number of hours × Cost per hour
Total cost = 24 hours × $125/hour = $3,000

Therefore, the total cost of John's physical therapy sessions was $3,000.
