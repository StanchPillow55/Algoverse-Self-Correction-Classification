Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Let's represent Jerry's current age as x.

Step 1: Find Jerry's age 5 years ago.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x - 5

Step 2: Find Jerry's current age in terms of his age 5 years ago.
Jerry's current age = 2 Ã— (x - 5)
Jerry's current age = 2x - 10

Step 3: Find how old Jerry will be in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = (2x - 10) + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 2x - 7

Therefore, Jerry will be 2x - 7 years old in 3 years.

Final answer: Jerry will be 2x - 7 years old in 3 years.
