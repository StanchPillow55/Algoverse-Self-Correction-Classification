To solve this problem, we need to find Jerry's current age and then calculate his age in 3 years.

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Step 1: Find Jerry's current age.
Let Jerry's age 5 years ago be x.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x
Jerry's current age = 2x (since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago)

Step 2: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 2x + 3

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jerry will be 2x + 3 years old in 3 years.
