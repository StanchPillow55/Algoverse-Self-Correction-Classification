Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Let's represent Jerry's current age as x.

Step 1: Find Jerry's age 5 years ago.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x - 5

Step 2: Find Jerry's current age in terms of his age 5 years ago.
Jerry's current age = 2 Ã— (Jerry's age 5 years ago)
x = 2 Ã— (x - 5)

Step 3: Solve for Jerry's current age (x).
x = 2x - 10
-x = -10
x = 10

Therefore, Jerry's current age is 10 years old.

Step 4: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 10 + 3 = 13 years old

Final answer:
Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.
