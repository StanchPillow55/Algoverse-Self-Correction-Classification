To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of acres of both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms.

Given information:
- Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.
- Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice Farmer Brown's farm.

Step 1: Calculate the size of Farmer Smith's farm.
Farmer Smith's farm = 2 × Farmer Brown's farm + 100 acres
Farmer Smith's farm = 2 × 200 acres + 100 acres
Farmer Smith's farm = 400 acres + 100 acres
Farmer Smith's farm = 500 acres

Step 2: Calculate the total number of acres of both farms.
Total acres = Farmer Brown's farm + Farmer Smith's farm
Total acres = 200 acres + 500 acres
Total acres = 700 acres

Therefore, the two farms have a total of 700 acres.

Final answer: The two farms have a total of 700 acres.
