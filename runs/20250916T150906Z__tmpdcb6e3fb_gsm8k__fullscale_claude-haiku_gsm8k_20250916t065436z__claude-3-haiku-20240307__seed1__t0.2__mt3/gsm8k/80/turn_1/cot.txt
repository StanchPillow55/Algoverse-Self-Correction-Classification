Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 24 liters of water.
- Two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water.
- Then a boy got 6 liters of water.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water each girl got.
1/6 of 24 liters = 24 รท 6 = 4 liters
So, each girl got 4 liters of water.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water the two girls got.
Total water for the two girls = 4 liters + 4 liters = 8 liters

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water left after the two girls got their share.
Total water - Water for the two girls = 24 liters - 8 liters = 16 liters

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water left after the boy got his 6 liters.
Water left after the boy got his share = 16 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters
