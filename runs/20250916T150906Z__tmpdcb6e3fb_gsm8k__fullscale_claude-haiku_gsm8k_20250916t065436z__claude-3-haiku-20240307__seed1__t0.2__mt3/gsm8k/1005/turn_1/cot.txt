Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.

2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
   * To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5:
   * 50 x 3/5 = 30 female porcupines

3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   * In a year, there are 12 months.
   * So each female porcupine will give birth to 4 x 12 = 48 babies in a year.

4. To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we need to add the new babies to the original population.
   * Total new babies born in a year = 30 female porcupines x 48 babies per female = 1,440 new babies
   * Original population = 50 porcupines
   * Total porcupines after a year = 50 +
