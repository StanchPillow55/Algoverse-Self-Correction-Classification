Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.

2. The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
   * To find the number of female porcupines, we multiply the total population by 3/5:
   * 50 x 3/5 = 30 female porcupines

3. Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
   * In a year, there are 12 months.
   * So each female porcupine will give birth to 4 x 12 = 48 babies in a year.

4. To find the total number of porcupines after a year, we need to add the original population, the number of female porcupines, and the number of babies born in a year.
   * Original population: 50
   * Number of female porcupines: 30
   * Number of babies born in a year: 30 x 48 = 1,440
   * Total p
