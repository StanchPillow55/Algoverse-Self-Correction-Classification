Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- We need to find the number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 × 50 = 30 female porcupines

Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month.
Number of babies born per month = 30 female porcupines × 4 babies per female = 120 babies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of porcupines in the park after a year.
Number of porcupines after a year = Initial population + (Number of babies born per month × 12 months)
Number of porcupines after a year = 50 + (120 × 12) = 50 + 1,
