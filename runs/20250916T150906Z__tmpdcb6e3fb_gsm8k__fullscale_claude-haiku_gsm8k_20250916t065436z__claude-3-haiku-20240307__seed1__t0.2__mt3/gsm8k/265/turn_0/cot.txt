To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee, and then compare it to Mrs. Cruz's budget.

Given information:
- Selling price of the house: $350,000
- Brokerage fee: 5% of the selling price
- Transfer fee: 12% of the selling price
- Mrs. Cruz's budget: $400,000

Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.
Brokerage fee = 5% of the selling price
Brokerage fee = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.
Transfer fee = 12% of the selling price
Transfer fee = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total cost = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the total cost and Mrs
