Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000
- The selling price of the property is $350,000
- The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price
- The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price

Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.
Brokerage fee = 5% of $350,000 = 0.05 × $350,000 = $17,500

Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.
Transfer fee = 12% of $350,000 = 0.12 × $350,000 = $42,000

Step 3: Calculate the total price of the house.
Total price = Selling price + Brokerage fee + Transfer fee
Total price = $350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Step 4: Calculate the difference between the total price and Mrs. Cruz's budget.
Difference = Total price - Mrs. Cruz's budget
Difference = $409,500 - $400,
