To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Brian will walk in 7 days based on the given information about Sofie's walking distance.

Given information:
- In 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
- Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.
Sofie's daily walking distance × Number of days = Total distance Sofie will walk
10 miles × 7 days = 70 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Brian will walk in 7 days.
Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, we can divide Sofie's total distance by 2 to find Brian's total distance.
Total distance Sofie will walk / 2 = Total distance Brian will walk
70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.

Final answer: Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.
