To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
3. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
* At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.
* By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
* To calculate the number of people who had voted by midday, we multiply the total number of people by 2/5:
* 5000 Ã— 2/5 = 2000 people had voted by midday.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
* By midday (12:00), 2000 people had voted.
* By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.
* To calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday, we subtract the
