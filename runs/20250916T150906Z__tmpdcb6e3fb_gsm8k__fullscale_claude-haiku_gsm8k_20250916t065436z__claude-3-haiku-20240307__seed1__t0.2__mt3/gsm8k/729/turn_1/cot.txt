Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station.
- By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
- By 16:00 (4:00 PM), 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2/5 of 5000 people = 2/5 × 5000 = 2000 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by midday (12:00).
Number of people who had not voted by midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00 (4:00 PM).
2/3 of the remaining 3000 people = 2/3 × 3000 = 2000 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16
