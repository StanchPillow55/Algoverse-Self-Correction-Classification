Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- A DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks.
- There are two DVDs in the public library.
- One DVD has been played 356 times.
- The other DVD has been played 135 times.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to calculate the remaining number of plays for each DVD and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining number of plays for the first DVD.
Total plays before breaking = 1000 times
Plays already used = 356 times
Remaining plays for the first DVD = 1000 - 356 = 644 times

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of plays for the second DVD.
Total plays before breaking = 1000 times
Plays already used = 135 times
Remaining plays for the second DVD = 1000 - 135 = 865 times

Step 3: Calculate the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break.
Total remaining plays = Remaining plays for the
