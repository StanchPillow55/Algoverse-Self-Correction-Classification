Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard.
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie.

Step 1: Calculate how many eggs Stacy found.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
Stacy's eggs = 2 × Lamar's eggs
Stacy's eggs = 2 × 5 = 10 eggs

Step 2: Calculate how many eggs Charlie found.
Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so:
Charlie's eggs = Stacy's eggs - 2
Charlie's eggs = 10 - 2 = 8 eggs

Step 3: Calculate how many eggs Mei found.
Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so:
Mei's eggs = 1/2 × Charlie's eggs
Mei's eggs = 1/2 × 8
