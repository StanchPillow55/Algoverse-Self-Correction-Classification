Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
2. The special size box has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.
   * To calculate the number of pods in the special box:
     * 100 pods + 20% of 100 pods = 100 + (0.20 x 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods
3. The question asks how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 if 1 pod is used per cycle.
   * To calculate this, we need to find out how many cycles can be run with the special box.
   * Cost of special box: $12
   * Number of pods in special box: 120
   * Cycles per $1 = (120 pods / $12) = 10 cycles per $1

Therefore, the final answer is:
You can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new special box for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.
