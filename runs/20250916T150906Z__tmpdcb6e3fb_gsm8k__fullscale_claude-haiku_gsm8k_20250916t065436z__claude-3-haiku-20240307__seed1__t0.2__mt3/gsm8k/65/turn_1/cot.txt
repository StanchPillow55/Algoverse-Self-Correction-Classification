Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
2. He then reads for half as long, which is 1 hour.
3. He does this 3 times a week.
4. So in 1 week, he spends:
   - 2 hours watching TV
   - 1 hour reading
   - Total of 3 hours per week

5. Now, we need to find the total for 4 weeks:
   - 3 hours per week x 4 weeks = 12 hours

Therefore, the total number of hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is 12 hours.
