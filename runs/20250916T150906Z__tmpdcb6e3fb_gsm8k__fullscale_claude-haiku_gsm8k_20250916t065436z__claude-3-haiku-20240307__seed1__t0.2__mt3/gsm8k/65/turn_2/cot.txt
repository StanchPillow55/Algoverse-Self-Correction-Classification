Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.
- He then reads for half as long as he watched TV.
- He does this 3 times a week.
- We need to find the total hours spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on reading per day.
Time spent on reading = 1/2 × 2 hours = 1 hour

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading per day.
Total time per day = Time spent on TV + Time spent on reading
Total time per day = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading per week.
Total time per week = Total time per day × 3 days
Total time per week = 3 hours × 3 days = 9 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TV and reading in 4 weeks.
Total time in 4 weeks = Total time per week × 4 weeks
Total time
