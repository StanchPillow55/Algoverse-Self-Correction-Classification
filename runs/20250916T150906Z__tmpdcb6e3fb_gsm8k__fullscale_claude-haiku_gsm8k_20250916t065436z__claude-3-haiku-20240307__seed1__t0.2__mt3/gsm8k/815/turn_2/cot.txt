Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tanya makes a salt scrub that fills a 10-ounce jar.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's assign variables to represent the amounts of each ingredient:
- Let x = amount of citrus zest and fragrance
- Let y = amount of salt and sugar
- Let 2y = amount of oil

Step 1: Find the relationship between the variables.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we can say that x = x.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we can say that y = y.
Since Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, we can say that 2y = oil.

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total volume of the salt scrub.
Total volume = citrus zest + fragrance + salt + sugar +
