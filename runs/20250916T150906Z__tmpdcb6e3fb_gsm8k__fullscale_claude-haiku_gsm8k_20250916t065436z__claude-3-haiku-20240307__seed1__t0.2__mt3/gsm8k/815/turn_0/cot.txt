To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of oil Tanya uses in her salt scrub recipe.

Given information:
- Tanya makes enough salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar each time.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of zest and fragrance.
- Let y be the amount of salt and sugar.

Step 1: Express the relationship between the variables.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of zest as fragrance, we can say that the amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, which is x.
Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we can say that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar, which is y.
Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt, so the amount of oil is 2y.
Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so the
