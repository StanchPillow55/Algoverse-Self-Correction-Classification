Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original price of the beef jerky bag is $18.00.
2. The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky.
3. Archie buys the bag while it's $3.00 off, so the discounted price is $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00.

Now, to find the cost per stick of jerky:
* Cost per bag = $15.00
* Number of sticks per bag = 30
* Cost per stick = $15.00 / 30 = $0.50

To convert this to cents:
* $0.50 = 50 cents

Therefore, the cost of each stick of jerky is 50 cents.

Final answer: 50 cents per stick of beef jerky.
