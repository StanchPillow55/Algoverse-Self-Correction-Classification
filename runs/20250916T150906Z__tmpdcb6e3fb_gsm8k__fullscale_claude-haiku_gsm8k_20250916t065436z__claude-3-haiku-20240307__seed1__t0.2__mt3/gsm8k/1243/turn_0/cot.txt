Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each bag of beef jerky contains 30 sticks.
- The regular price of a bag is $18.00.
- Archie buys 1 bag while it's $3.00 off the regular price.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the bag.
Regular price of the bag = $18.00
Discount on the bag = $3.00
Discounted price of the bag = $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost per stick of jerky.
Number of sticks per bag = 30
Discounted price of the bag = $15.00
Cost per stick of jerky = Discounted price of the bag / Number of sticks per bag
Cost per stick of jerky = $15.00 / 30 = $0.50 per stick

Step 3: Convert the cost per stick to cents.
Cost per stick in cents = $0.50 Ã— 100 = 50 cents per stick

Therefore, the cost
