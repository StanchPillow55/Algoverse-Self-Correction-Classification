Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Martha invited:
   - 2 families with 6 people each, so 2 x 6 = 12 people
   - 3 families with 4 people each, so 3 x 4 = 12 people
   - Total invited: 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
   - 24 people - 8 people = 16 people

3. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments.
   - 1/4 of 8 = 2 people
   - 16 people - 2 people = 14 people

Therefore, the final answer is that 14 people showed up for Martha's party.
