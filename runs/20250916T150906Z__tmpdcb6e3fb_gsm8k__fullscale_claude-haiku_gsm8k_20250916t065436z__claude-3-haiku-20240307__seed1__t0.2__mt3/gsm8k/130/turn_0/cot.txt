To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step.

Given information:
- Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store's Santa village.
- A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them.
- 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

Step 1: Calculate the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.
One-third of 60 elves = 60 รท 3 = 20 elves

Step 2: Calculate the number of elves remaining after the first group of elves quit.
Number of elves remaining = 60 - 20 = 40 elves

Step 3: Calculate the number of elves who quit after kids kick their shins.
10 elves quit after kids kick their shins.

Step 4: Calculate the number of elves left.
Number of elves left = 40 - 10 = 30 elves

Therefore, the final answer is that 30 elves are left.
