To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces they can add per minute and then calculate the time it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Kalinda's mom can add per minute.
Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute = 1/2 × Kalinda's pieces per minute
Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute = 1/2 × 4 = 2 pieces per minute

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces they can add per minute.
Total pieces per minute = Kalinda's pieces per minute + Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute
Total pieces per minute = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Step 3: Calculate the time it will take them to complete the puzzle.
Time to complete the puzzle = Total number of pieces / Total pieces per minute
Time to complete the puzzle =
