Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate Kalinda's rate of adding pieces.
Kalinda's rate = 4 pieces per minute

Step 2: Calculate Kalinda's mom's rate of adding pieces.
Kalinda's mom's rate = 1/2 × Kalinda's rate = 1/2 × 4 = 2 pieces per minute

Step 3: Calculate the total rate of adding pieces per minute.
Total rate = Kalinda's rate + Kalinda's mom's rate
Total rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

Step 4: Calculate the total time it will take to complete the puzzle.
Total time = Total number of pieces / Total rate of adding pieces
Total time = 360 pieces / 6 pieces per minute = 60 minutes

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes
