Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10 people think horse #2 will win

2. Now we need to find the remaining number of people:
   * Total people = 50
   * People who think horse #2 will win = 10
   * Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people

3. 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
   * 60% of 40 = 0.60 x 40 = 24 people think horse #7 will win

4. Now we can find the number of people who think horse #12 will win:
   * Total people = 50
   * People who think horse #2 will win = 10
   * People who think horse #7 will win = 24
   * People who think horse #12 will win = 50 - 10 - 24
