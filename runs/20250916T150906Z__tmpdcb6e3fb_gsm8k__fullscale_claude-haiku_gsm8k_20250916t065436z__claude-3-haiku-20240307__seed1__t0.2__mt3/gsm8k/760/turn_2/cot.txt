Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

2. The remaining people are 50 - 10 = 40 people.

3. 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
   * 60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

4. The remaining people who think horse #12 will win are:
   * 40 - 24 = 16 people

Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win the big race is 16.
