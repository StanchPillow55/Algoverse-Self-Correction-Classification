Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win the big race.
- 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
- The rest of the people think horse #12 will win the big race.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win.
20% of 50 people = 0.20 × 50 = 10 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who are left after the 10 people who think horse #2 will win.
Total people - People who think horse #2 will win = Remaining people
50 - 10 = 40 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win.
60% of the remaining 40 people = 0.60 × 40 = 24 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win.
Remaining people - People who think horse #7 will win = People who think horse #12
