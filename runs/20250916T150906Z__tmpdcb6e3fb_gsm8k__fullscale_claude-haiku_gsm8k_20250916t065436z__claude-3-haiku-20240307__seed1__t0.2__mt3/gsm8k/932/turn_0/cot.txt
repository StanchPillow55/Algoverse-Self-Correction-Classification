To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of water balloons the girls had after Maria's mom gave them additional balloons.

Given information:
- Maria invited 4 of her friends over for a water balloon fight.
- At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her friends 2 water balloons.
- Maria had one water balloon for herself.
- Maria's mom then gave each person 3 more balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of water balloons the girls had at the start of the game.
Number of balloons for Maria's friends = 4 friends × 2 balloons each = 8 balloons
Number of balloons for Maria = 1 balloon
Total number of balloons at the start of the game = 8 + 1 = 9 balloons

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional balloons Maria's mom gave to each person.
Number of additional balloons for each person = 3 balloons
Total number of additional balloons = 5 people (4 friends + Maria) × 3 balloons each = 15 balloons

Step 3
