Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons each.
   * 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
   * 1 balloon for Maria

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.
   * 4 friends x 3 balloons each = 12 balloons
   * 1 balloon for Maria

4. To calculate the total number of balloons:
   * Balloons given by Maria: 8 + 1 = 9
   * Balloons given by Maria's mom: 12
   * Total balloons: 9 + 12 = 21

Therefore, the total number of balloons the girls had is 21.
