To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of beads each sister bought and then calculate the difference between them.

Given information:
- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought.
Red beads: 1 pack × 20 beads per pack = 20 red beads
Clear beads: 2 packs × 20 beads per pack = 40 clear beads
Total beads Elizabeth bought = 20 red beads + 40 clear beads = 60 beads

Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought.
Blue beads: 3 packs × 20 beads per pack = 60 blue beads
Red beads: 4 packs × 20 beads per pack = 80 red beads
Total beads Margareth bought
