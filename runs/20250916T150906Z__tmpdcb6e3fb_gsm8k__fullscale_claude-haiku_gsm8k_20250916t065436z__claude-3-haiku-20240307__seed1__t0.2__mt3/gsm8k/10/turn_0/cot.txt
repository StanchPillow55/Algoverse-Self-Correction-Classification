Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
Downloads in the second month = 3 × Downloads in the first month
Downloads in the second month = 3 × 60 = 180 downloads

Step 2: Calculate the number of downloads in the third month.
Downloads in the third month = Downloads in the second month - (Downloads in the second month × 0.30)
Downloads in the third month = 180 - (180 × 0.30) = 180 - 54 = 126 downloads

Step 3: Calculate the total number of downloads over the three months.
Total downloads = Downloads in the first month + Downloads in the second month + Downloads in the third month
Total downloads = 60 + 180 + 126 = 366
