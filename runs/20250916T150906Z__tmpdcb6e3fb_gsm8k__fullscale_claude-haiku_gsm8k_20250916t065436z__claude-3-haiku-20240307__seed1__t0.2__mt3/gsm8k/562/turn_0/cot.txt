To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Understand the given information:
   - The great pyramids sit at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground when you stand at the entrance of Sahir's house.
   - The sun is moving at 5 degrees an hour straight upward from the pyramid relative to Sahir's house.
   - The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid and moves for 10 hours.

2. Calculate the total angle change of the sun:
   - The sun moves 5 degrees per hour.
   - The sun moves for 10 hours.
   - Total angle change of the sun = 5 degrees/hour Ã— 10 hours = 50 degrees.

3. Calculate the final angle from the ground to the sun:
   - The initial angle from the ground to the tip of the pyramid is 32 degrees.
   - The sun has moved 50 degrees upward from the tip of the pyramid.
   - The final angle from the ground to the sun = 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, the final angle from the
