To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of cars Joe has initially.
2. Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
3. Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
4. Calculate the number of cars Joe has remaining.

Step 1: Find the number of cars Joe has initially.
Since Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, we can calculate the number of cars Joe has initially:
Joe's initial number of cars = 2 × Robert's number of cars = 2 × 20 = 40 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Joe sold.
Joe sold 20% of his cars, so we can calculate the number of cars he sold:
Number of cars sold = 20% of 40 cars = 0.20 × 40 = 8 cars

Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gave away to his mother.
Joe gave away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, so we can calculate the number of cars he gave away:
Number of cars given away = 2 ×
