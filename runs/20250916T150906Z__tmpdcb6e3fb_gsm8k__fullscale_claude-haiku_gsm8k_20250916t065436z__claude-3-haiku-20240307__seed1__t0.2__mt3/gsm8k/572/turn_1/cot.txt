Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ford grows 40 roses every week.
- The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
Roses ordered by first shop: 20 per week
Roses ordered by second shop: 15 per week
Roses ordered by third shop: 30 per week
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 2: Calculate the number of roses Ford can supply per week.
Ford grows 40 roses per week.

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the roses ordered and the roses supplied per week.
Roses ordered per week: 65
Roses supplied per week: 40
Difference = 65 - 40 = 25 roses

Step 4: Calculate the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month.
