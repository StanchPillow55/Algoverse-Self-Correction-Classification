To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
2. Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
3. Calculate the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered per week.
4. Convert the weekly difference to a monthly difference.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows per week.
Ford grows 40 roses every week.
Total roses grown per week = 40 roses

Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the three flower shops per week.
First flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
Second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
Third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.
Total roses ordered per week = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered per week.
Difference = Total roses grown per week - Total roses ordered per week
Difference = 40 - 65 = -25 roses

Step 4: Convert the weekly difference to a monthly difference
