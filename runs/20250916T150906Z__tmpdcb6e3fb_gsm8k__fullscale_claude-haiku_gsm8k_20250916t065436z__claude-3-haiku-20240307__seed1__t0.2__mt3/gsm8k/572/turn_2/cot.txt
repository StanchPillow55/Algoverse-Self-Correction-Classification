Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Ford grows 40 roses every week.
2. The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
3. The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
4. The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

To find the total number of roses Ford needs to supply per week, we add up the orders from the three flower shops:
* 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

Now, to find the number of roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to:
* Calculate the total number of roses Ford can supply in a month
* Calculate the total number of roses the flower shops need in a month
* Subtract the number of roses Ford can supply from the number of roses the flower shops need

Ford can supply 40 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks) he can supply:
* 40 roses/week x 4 weeks = 160 roses per month

The flower shops need 65 roses per week, so in a month (4 weeks) they
