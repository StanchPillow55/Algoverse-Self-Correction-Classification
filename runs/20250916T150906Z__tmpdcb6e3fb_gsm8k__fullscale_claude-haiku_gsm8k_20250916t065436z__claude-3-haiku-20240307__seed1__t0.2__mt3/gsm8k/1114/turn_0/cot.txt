Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raymond had $21 initially.
- He saved $11 from his allowance.
- He spent $5 on a comic book.
- He spent $19 on a puzzle.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Raymond had after saving $11 from his allowance.
Initial amount + Amount saved = Total amount
$21 + $11 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Raymond spent.
Amount spent on comic book + Amount spent on puzzle = Total amount spent
$5 + $19 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Raymond has left.
Total amount - Total amount spent = Amount of money left
$32 - $24 = $8

Therefore, Raymond has $8 left.

Final answer: Raymond has $8 left.
