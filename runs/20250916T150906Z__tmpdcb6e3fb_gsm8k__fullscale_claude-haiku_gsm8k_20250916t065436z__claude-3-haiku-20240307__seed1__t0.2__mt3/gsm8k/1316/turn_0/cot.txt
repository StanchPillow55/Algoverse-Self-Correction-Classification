Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. Cost of the new radiator:
   * The original cost of the radiator is $400
   * Mark gets an 80% discount at the junk shop
   * To calculate the discounted price:
     * 80% of $400 = 0.8 x $400 = $320
   * So, the cost of the radiator at the junk shop is $400 - $320 = $80

2. Cost of the mechanic's labor:
   * The mechanic charges $50 per hour
   * The installation takes 3 hours
   * So, the cost of the mechanic's labor is 3 hours x $50 per hour = $150

3. Total cost:
   * Cost of the radiator: $80
   * Cost of the mechanic's labor: $150
   * Total cost = $80 + $150 = $230

Therefore, the total amount that Mark paid for the new radiator and its installation is $230.

Final answer: Mark paid $230.
