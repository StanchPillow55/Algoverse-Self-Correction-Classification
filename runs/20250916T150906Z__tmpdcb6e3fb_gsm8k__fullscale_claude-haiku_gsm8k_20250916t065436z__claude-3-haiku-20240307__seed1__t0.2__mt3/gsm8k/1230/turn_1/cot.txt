Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Charlie's standard fee for a 1-hour lesson is $80.
2. He reduces his rate by 25% when teaching a veteran.
   * 25% of $80 is $20.
   * So, the reduced rate for a veteran is $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.

3. Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate of $80 per hour.
   * 4 lessons x $80 per hour = $320.

4. Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.
   * 2 lessons x $60 per hour = $120.

5. To calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we add the earnings from the standard rate lessons and the reduced rate lessons:
   * $320 + $120 = $440.

Therefore, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.
