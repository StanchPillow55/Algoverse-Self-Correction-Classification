To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day by considering the standard rate and the discounted rate for the veteran lessons.

Given information:
- Charlie's standard fee is $80 per hour for lessons.
- He reduces his rate by 25% when giving lessons to a veteran.
- Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate and 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money for the 4 standard rate lessons.
Standard rate per lesson = $80 per hour
Number of standard rate lessons = 4
Total amount for standard rate lessons = 4 × $80 = $320

Step 2: Calculate the discounted rate for the veteran lessons.
Discount rate = 25% of $80 = 0.25 × $80 = $20
Discounted rate per lesson = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money for the 2 veteran lessons.
Discounted rate per lesson = $60 per hour
Number of veteran lessons =
