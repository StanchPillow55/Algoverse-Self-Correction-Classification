To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Chris to mow the lawn by using both the "turtle" mode and the "rabbit" mode.

Given information:
- In "turtle" mode, it takes Chris 1 hour (60 minutes) to mow the entire lawn.
- In "rabbit" mode, it takes Chris 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn.
- Today, Chris mowed half the lawn in "turtle" mode and the other half in "rabbit" mode.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode = 1/2 × 60 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode.
Time to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode = 1/2 × 40 minutes = 20 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it takes to mow the entire lawn.
Total time = Time to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode + Time to mow half the
