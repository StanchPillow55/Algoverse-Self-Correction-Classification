Okay, let's break this down step by step:

Given information:
- Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
- On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons.
- On the second day, his wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
- On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
- On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.

Amount of root beer remaining after the second day = 20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the amount
