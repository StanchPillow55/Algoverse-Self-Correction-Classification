To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the changes in the amount of root beer over the four days and then calculate the amount available for each person at the party.

Given information:
- Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.
- On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons.
- On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
- On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
- On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.

Amount of root beer consumed by children = 4 gallons
Amount of root beer remaining after the first day = 24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of root beer remaining after the second day.
Amount of root beer remaining after the first day = 20 gallons
Amount of root beer spilled by Barbie = 7 gallons
Amount of root beer remaining after the
