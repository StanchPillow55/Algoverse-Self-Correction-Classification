Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer.
2. On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, leaving 20 gallons.
3. On the second day, Barbie spilled 7 gallons, leaving 13 gallons.
4. On the third day, Ronnie drank 5 gallons, leaving 8 gallons.
5. On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.

To calculate how much root beer was available for each person, we need to divide the remaining 8 gallons by the 3 people at the party.

8 gallons รท 3 people = 2.67 gallons per person

Therefore, the final answer is that each person at the party had 2.67 gallons of root beer available to drink.
