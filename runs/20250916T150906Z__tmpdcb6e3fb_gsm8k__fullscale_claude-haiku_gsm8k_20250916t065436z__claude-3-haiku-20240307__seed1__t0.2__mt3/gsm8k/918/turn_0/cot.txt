Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- 6 students playing tennis
- Twice the number of students playing tennis are playing volleyball
- 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer

Step 1: Calculate the number of students playing volleyball.
Number of students playing volleyball = 2 Ã— 6 = 12 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of students playing sports.
Total students playing sports = Students playing tennis + Students playing volleyball + Students playing soccer
Total students playing sports = 6 + 12 + (16 + 22) = 56 students

Therefore, the total number of students is 56.

Final answer: The total number of students is 56.
