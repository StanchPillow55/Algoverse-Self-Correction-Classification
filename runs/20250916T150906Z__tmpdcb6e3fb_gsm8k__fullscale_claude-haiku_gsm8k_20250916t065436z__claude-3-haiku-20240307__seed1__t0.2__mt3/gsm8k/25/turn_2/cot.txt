Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 chicken meal that costs $12
- 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each
- 4 apples that cost $1.50 each
- Some boxes of pizza that cost $8.50 each
- Total amount paid by Marie is $50

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.
Cost of chicken meal = $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk = 5 × $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples = 4 × $1.50 = $6

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount that Marie spent on the boxes of pizza.
Total amount paid by Marie = $50
Amount spent on chicken meal, milk, and apples = $33
Amount spent on boxes of pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

Step 3: Calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered.
