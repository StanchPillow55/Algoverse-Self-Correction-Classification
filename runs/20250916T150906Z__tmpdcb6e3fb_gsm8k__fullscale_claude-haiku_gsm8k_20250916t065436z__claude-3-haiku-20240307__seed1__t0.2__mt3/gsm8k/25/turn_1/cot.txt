Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 chicken meal at $12
- 5 packs of milk at $3 each
- 4 apples at $1.50 each
- Some boxes of pizza at $8.50 each
- Total paid: $50

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the known items.
Cost of chicken meal = $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk = 5 × $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples = 4 × $1.50 = $6

Total cost of known items = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount spent on the pizza boxes.
Total paid - Total cost of known items = Cost of pizza boxes
$50 - $33 = $17

Step 3: Calculate the number of pizza boxes ordered.
Cost of pizza boxes / Cost per pizza box = Number of pizza boxes
$17 / $8.50 = 2 pizza boxes

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
