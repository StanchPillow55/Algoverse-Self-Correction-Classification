Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir.
- Amir eats 5 cookies.

Step 1: Find how many cookies Cody eats.
Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir.
Cody's cookies = 3 × Amir's cookies
Cody's cookies = 3 × 5 = 15 cookies

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir.
Total cookies eaten = Cody's cookies + Amir's cookies
Total cookies eaten = 15 + 5 = 20 cookies

Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir is 20 cookies.
