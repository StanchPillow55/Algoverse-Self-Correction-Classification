Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and show the complete reasoning and work.

Given information:
- Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills from the bank.
- He loses 10 bills while getting home.
- He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.
- He then triples his money.
- He converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.

Step 1: Calculate the number of 20 dollar bills Thomas withdrew from the bank.
Number of 20 dollar bills = $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

Step 2: Calculate the number of bills remaining after losing 10 bills.
Number of bills remaining = 50 - 10 = 40 bills

Step 3: Calculate the number of bills used to pay for a bill.
Number of bills used = 40 / 2 = 20 bills

Step 4: Calculate the number of bills remaining after paying the bill.
Number of bills remaining = 40 - 20 = 20 bills

Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money Thomas has after tripling
