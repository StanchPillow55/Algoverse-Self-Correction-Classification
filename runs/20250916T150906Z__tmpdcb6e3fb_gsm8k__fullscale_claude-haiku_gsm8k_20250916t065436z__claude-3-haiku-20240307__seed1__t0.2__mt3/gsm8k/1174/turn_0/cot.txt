Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills:
   * $1000 / $20 per bill = 50 bills

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home:
   * 50 bills - 10 lost bills = 40 bills remaining

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
   * 40 bills / 2 = 20 bills used to pay the bill
   * 40 bills - 20 bills = 20 bills remaining

4. Thomas then triples his money:
   * 20 bills x $20 per bill = $400
   * $400 x 3 = $1200

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills:
   * $1200 / $5 per bill = 240 bills

Therefore, the final answer is that Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.

Let's go through the step-by-step reasoning and calculations:
