Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills:
   * $1000 / $20 = 50 bills

2. He loses 10 bills while getting home:
   * 50 bills - 10 bills = 40 bills

3. He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill:
   * 40 bills / 2 = 20 bills

4. Thomas then triples his money:
   * 20 bills x 3 = 60 bills

5. He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills:
   * 60 bills x $5 = $300

Therefore, the final answer is that Thomas has 60 bills of $5 each, which is a total of $300.
