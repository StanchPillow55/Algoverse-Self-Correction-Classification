To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus.
2. Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
3. Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus.
Total gallons of milk purchased = 4000 gallons
Cost per gallon = $3.5
Total cost of milk purchased = 4000 gallons × $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Step 2: Determine the amount of milk that passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
Proportion of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 or 40%
Amount of milk that passed the expiry date = 4000 gallons × 2/5 = 1600 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk.
Refund amount = Amount of sour milk × Cost per gallon
Refund amount = 1600 gallons
