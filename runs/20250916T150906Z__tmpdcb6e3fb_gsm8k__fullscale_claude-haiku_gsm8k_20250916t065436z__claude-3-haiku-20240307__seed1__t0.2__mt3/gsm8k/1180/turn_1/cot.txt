Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company sold 4000 gallons of milk to Mr. Marcellus' store.
- The cost of the milk was $3.5 per gallon.
- Mr. Marcellus later realized that 2/5 of the milk he purchased had passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
- Mr. Marcellus returned the sour milk to the company and ordered a refund.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased by Mr. Marcellus.
Total cost of milk = 4000 gallons × $3.5 per gallon = $14,000

Step 2: Calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date and could not be sold.
Amount of milk that passed the expiry date = 2/5 of 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons

Step 3: Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk.
Refund amount = 1600 gallons × $3.5 per gallon = $5,600
