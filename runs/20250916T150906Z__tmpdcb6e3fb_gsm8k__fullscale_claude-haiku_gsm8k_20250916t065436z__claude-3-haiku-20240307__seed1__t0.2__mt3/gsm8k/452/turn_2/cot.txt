Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The car drives 60 mph for 2 hours.
- The car then drives 30 mph for 1 hour.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours.
Distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours = 60 mph × 2 hours = 120 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour.
Distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour = 30 mph × 1 hour = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = Distance traveled at 60 mph + Distance traveled at 30 mph
Total distance traveled = 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total time of the trip.
Total time = 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours

Step 5: Calculate the average
