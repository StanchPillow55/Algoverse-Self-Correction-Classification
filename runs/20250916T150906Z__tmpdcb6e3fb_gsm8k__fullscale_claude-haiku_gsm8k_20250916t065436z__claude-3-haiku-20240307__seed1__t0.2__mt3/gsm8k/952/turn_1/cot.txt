Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
- Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the time period and multiply it by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Vince was stapling reports.
Time period = 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours

Step 2: Convert the total number of hours to minutes.
Total minutes = 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the total time period.
Number of 15-minute intervals = 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports Vince stapled.
Number of reports stapled per interval = 30 reports
