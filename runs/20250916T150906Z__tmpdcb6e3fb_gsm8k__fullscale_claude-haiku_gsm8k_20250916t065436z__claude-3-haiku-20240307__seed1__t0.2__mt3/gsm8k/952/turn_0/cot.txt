To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of reports Vince can staple in the given time frame.

Given information:
- Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
- Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Vince was stapling reports.
Total time = 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours

Step 2: Convert the total time from hours to minutes.
Total time in minutes = 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the total time.
Number of 15-minute intervals = 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports Vince can staple.
Total reports stapled = Number of 15-minute intervals × Reports stapled per interval
Total reports stapled = 60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1,800 reports

Therefore,
