Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   * This means he can staple 120 reports per hour (30 reports x 4 quarters per hour).

2. Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.
   * This is a total of 15 hours (11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours).

3. To calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   * Vince can staple 120 reports per hour.
   * He worked for 15 hours.
   * So the total number of reports stapled is:
     * 120 reports/hour x 15 hours = 1,800 reports.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Vince stapled a total of 1,800 reports.
