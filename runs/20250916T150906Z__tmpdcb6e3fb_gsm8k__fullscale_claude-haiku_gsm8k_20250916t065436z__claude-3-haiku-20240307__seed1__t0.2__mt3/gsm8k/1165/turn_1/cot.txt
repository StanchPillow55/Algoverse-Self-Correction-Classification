Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:
   * The first two complexes have 200 apartments each
   * The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined
   * So, the third complex has 200 + 200 = 400 apartments
   * 60% of 400 is 0.6 x 400 = 240 apartments
   * Therefore, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

2. Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
   * Complex 1: 200 apartments
   * Complex 2: 200 apartments
   * Complex 3: 640 apartments
   * Total: 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments

3. Calculate the number of collections per week:
   * John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place
   * Total collections per week = 3 x 3 = 9 collections

4. Calculate the total amount earned per week:
   * John
