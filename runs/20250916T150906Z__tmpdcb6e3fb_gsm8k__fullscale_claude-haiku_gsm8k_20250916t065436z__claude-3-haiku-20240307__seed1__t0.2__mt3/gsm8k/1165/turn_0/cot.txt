To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of apartments John collects garbage from, the total number of collections per week, and then calculate the total amount of money he makes.

Given information:
- The first two apartment complexes have 200 apartments each.
- The third apartment complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.
- John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.
- He gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apartments in the third complex.
Total apartments in the first two complexes = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments
Third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined:
Number of apartments in the third complex = 400 + (0.6 Ã— 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments John collects garbage from.
Total apartments = Apartments in the first two complexes + Apartments in the third complex
Total apartments = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1,040 apartments

Step 3:
