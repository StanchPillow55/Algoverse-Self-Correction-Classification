Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the number of apartments in the third complex:
   * The first two complexes have 200 apartments each
   * The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined
   * So, the number of apartments in the third complex is:
     - 2 x 200 = 400 apartments
     - 60% of 400 = 0.6 x 400 = 240 apartments
     - Total apartments in the third complex = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

2. Calculate the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
   * 200 + 200 + 640 = 1,040 apartments

3. Determine the number of collections per week:
   * John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place
   * Total collections per week = 3 x 3 = 9 collections

4. Calculate the total amount earned per collection:
   * John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment
   * Total amount earned per collection = $
