Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests elected an early checkout, so the number of guests is now 100 - 24 = 76.
3. 15 guests elected a late checkout, so the number of guests is now 76 - 15 = 61.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, which is 2 * 15 = 30 people. So the number of guests is now 61 + 30 = 91.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in, so the final number of guests is 91 + 7 = 98.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.
