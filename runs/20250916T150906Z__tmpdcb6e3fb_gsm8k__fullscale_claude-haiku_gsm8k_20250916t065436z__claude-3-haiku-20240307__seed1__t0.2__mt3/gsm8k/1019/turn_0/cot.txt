Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The hotel was completely booked with 100 guests.
- 24 guests elected an early checkout.
- 15 guests elected for a late checkout.
- In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.
- 7 more people checked in after dinner was served.

Step 1: Calculate the number of guests who checked out early.
Number of guests who checked out early = 24

Step 2: Calculate the number of guests who checked out late.
Number of guests who checked out late = 15

Step 3: Calculate the number of guests who checked in during the afternoon.
Number of guests who checked in during the afternoon = 2 Ã— 15 = 30

Step 4: Calculate the number of guests who checked in after dinner.
Number of guests who checked in after dinner = 7

Step 5: Calculate the total number of guests in the hotel.
Total number of guests = Initial number of guests - Number of guests who checked out early - Number of guests who checked out late + Number of guests
