Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James is putting together 4 tables
- Each table has 4 legs
- Each leg needs 2 screws
- James has 40 screws

To find the number of screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws required and then subtract it from the number of screws he has.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all 4 tables.
Number of legs per table × Number of tables = Total number of legs
4 legs × 4 tables = 16 legs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of screws required for all the legs.
Number of screws per leg × Total number of legs = Total number of screws required
2 screws × 16 legs = 32 screws

Step 3: Calculate the number of screws James will have left over.
Total number of screws - Total number of screws required = Number of screws left over
40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws

Therefore, James will have 8
