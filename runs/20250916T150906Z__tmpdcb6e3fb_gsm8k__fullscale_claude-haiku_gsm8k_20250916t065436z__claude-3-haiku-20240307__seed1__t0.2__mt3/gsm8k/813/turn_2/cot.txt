Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bag of marshmallows has 35 marshmallows.
- Each S'more uses one marshmallow.
- John makes 9 S'mores.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marshmallows used for the S'mores.
John's S'mores: 9 marshmallows
DeSean's S'mores: 9 marshmallows
Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows

Step 2: Calculate the number of marshmallows dropped on the ground.
Marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (for S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows
