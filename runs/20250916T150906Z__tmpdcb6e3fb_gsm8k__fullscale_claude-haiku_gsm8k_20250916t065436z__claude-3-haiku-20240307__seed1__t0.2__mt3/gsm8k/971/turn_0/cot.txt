To solve this problem, we need to find the total length of the fence and then calculate the number of wooden slats required.

Given information:
- The fence is rectangular.
- The length of the fence is 15 feet.
- The width of the fence is 10 feet.
- Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the fence.
Total length of the fence = 2 × (length) + 2 × (width)
Total length of the fence = 2 × 15 feet + 2 × 10 feet
Total length of the fence = 30 feet + 20 feet
Total length of the fence = 50 feet

Step 2: Calculate the number of wooden slats required.
Number of wooden slats required = Total length of the fence × 2
Number of wooden slats required = 50 feet × 2
Number of wooden slats required = 100 wooden slats

Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the 15-foot by 10-foot rectangular wooden fence around his garden.
