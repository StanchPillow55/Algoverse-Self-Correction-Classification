Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given the dimensions of the rectangular fence:
   - Length: 15 feet
   - Width: 10 feet

2. To calculate the total length of fencing needed, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides:
   - Total fencing length = 2 x (15 feet) + 2 x (10 feet) = 50 feet

3. We are told that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds.
   - Total number of wood slats needed = 50 feet x 2 slats/foot = 100 slats

Therefore, the final answer is that Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the fence around his garden.
