Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Dan plants 3 rose bushes.
- Each rose bush has 25 roses.
- Each rose has 8 thorns.

To find the total number of thorns, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Find the total number of roses.
Total number of roses = Number of rose bushes × Number of roses per bush
Total number of roses = 3 × 25 = 75 roses

Step 2: Find the total number of thorns.
Total number of thorns = Total number of roses × Number of thorns per rose
Total number of thorns = 75 roses × 8 thorns per rose = 600 thorns

Therefore, the total number of thorns is 600.

Final answer: The total number of thorns is 600.
