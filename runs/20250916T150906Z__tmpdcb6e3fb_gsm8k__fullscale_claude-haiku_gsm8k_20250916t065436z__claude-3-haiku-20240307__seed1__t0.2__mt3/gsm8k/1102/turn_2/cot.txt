Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. She then returned one item that cost $15.00.
   * This means the initial charge on her credit card was reduced by $15.00.
   * The new balance on her credit card is $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00.

3. Sheila then bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.
   * The original price of the frying pan was $20.00.
   * The discount was 20%, which is 0.20 of the original price.
   * The discount amount is 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00.
   * The sale price of the frying pan is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
   * This $16.00 charge was added to her credit card balance.

4. Sheila also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00
