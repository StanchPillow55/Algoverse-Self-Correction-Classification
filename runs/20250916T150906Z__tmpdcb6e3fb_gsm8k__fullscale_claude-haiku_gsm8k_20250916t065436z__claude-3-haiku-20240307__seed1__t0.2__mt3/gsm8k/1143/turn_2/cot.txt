Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tim grows 5 trees
- Each tree produces 6 lemons per year
- We need to find the total number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years)

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons collected per year.
Number of trees × Number of lemons per tree per year = Total lemons per year
5 trees × 6 lemons per tree = 30 lemons per year

Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons collected in a decade (10 years).
Total lemons per year × Number of years = Total lemons in a decade
30 lemons per year × 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 300 lemons.

Final answer: Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.
