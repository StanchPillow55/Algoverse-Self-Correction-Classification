Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tim grows 5 trees.
- Each year, he collects 6 lemons from each tree.
- We need to find the total number of lemons he gets in a decade.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lemons Tim gets in one year.
Number of lemons per tree per year = 6
Number of trees = 5
Total number of lemons per year = 6 lemons per tree × 5 trees = 30 lemons

Step 2: Calculate the number of lemons Tim gets in a decade.
Number of years in a decade = 10
Total number of lemons in a decade = 30 lemons per year × 10 years = 300 lemons

Therefore, the final answer is:
Tim gets 300 lemons in a decade.
