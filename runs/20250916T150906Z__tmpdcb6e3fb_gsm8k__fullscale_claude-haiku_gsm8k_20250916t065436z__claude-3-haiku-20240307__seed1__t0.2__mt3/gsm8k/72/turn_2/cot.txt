Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brownies are sold for $3 per slice.
- Cheesecakes are sold for $4 per slice.
- Tommy sold 43 brownies.
- Tommy sold 23 slices of cheesecake.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling the brownies.
Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies sold × Price per brownie
Revenue from brownies = 43 × $3 = $129

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the cheesecake slices.
Revenue from cheesecake = Number of cheesecake slices sold × Price per cheesecake slice
Revenue from cheesecake = 23 × $4 = $92

Step 3: Calculate the total money raised by Tommy.
Total money raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecake
Total money raised = $129 + $92 = $221

Therefore, the total money Tommy raised from selling 43 brownies and 23 slices of cheesecake is $221.
