Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brownies are sold for $3 per slice
- Cheesecakes are sold for $4 per slice
- Tommy sold 43 brownies
- Tommy sold 23 slices of cheesecake

To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raised, we need to find the revenue from selling the brownies and the revenue from selling the cheesecakes, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling the brownies.
Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies sold × Price per brownie slice
Revenue from brownies = 43 × $3 = $129

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling the cheesecakes.
Revenue from cheesecakes = Number of cheesecake slices sold × Price per cheesecake slice
Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 × $4 = $92

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Tommy raised.
Total money raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
Total money raised = $129 + $92 =
