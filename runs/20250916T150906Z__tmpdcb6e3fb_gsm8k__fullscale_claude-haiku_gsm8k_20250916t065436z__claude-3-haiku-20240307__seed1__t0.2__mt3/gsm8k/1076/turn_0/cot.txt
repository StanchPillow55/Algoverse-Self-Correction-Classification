To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Terry makes from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each.
- Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.
- Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling milkshakes.
Total revenue from milkshakes = Number of milkshakes × Price per milkshake
Total revenue from milkshakes = 6 × $5.50 = $33.00

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling burger platters.
Total revenue from burger platters = Number of burger platters × Price per burger platter
Total revenue from burger platters = 9 × $11 = $99.00

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling sodas.
Total revenue from sodas = Number of sodas × Price per soda
Total revenue from sodas = 20 × $1.50 = $30.
