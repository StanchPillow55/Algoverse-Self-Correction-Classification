Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each:
   * 6 milkshakes x $5.50 each = $33.00

2. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each:
   * 9 burger platters x $11 each = $99.00

3. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each:
   * 20 sodas x $1.50 each = $30.00

4. To calculate the total money Terry makes, we add up the amounts from each item:
   * $33.00 (milkshakes) + $99.00 (burger platters) + $30.00 (sodas) = $162.00

Therefore, the total amount of money Terry makes is $162.00.
