Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * To find the amount of water in the tank, we divide the total water in the pool by 2:
   * 10,000 gallons รท 2 = 5,000 gallons

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.
4. We need to find the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.

To calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days, we need to subtract the amount of water used each day from the initial amount of water in the tank.

* Initial amount of water in the tank: 5,000 gallons
* Amount of water used per day: 500 gallons
* Number of days: 6

Calculation:
* Amount of water used in 6 days = 500 gallons/day ร 6 days = 3,000 gallons
