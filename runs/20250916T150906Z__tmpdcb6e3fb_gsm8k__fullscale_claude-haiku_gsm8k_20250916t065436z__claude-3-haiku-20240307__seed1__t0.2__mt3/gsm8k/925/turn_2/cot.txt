Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.
2. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
   * Half of 10,000 gallons is 5,000 gallons.
   * So the tank is filled with 5,000 gallons of water.

3. The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.
4. We need to find how many gallons will be remaining in the tank after 6 days.
   * After 1 day, 500 gallons will be used, leaving 5,000 - 500 = 4,500 gallons.
   * After 2 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,500 - 500 = 4,000 gallons.
   * After 3 days, another 500 gallons will be used, leaving 4,000 - 500 = 3,500 gallons.
   * After 4 days, another
