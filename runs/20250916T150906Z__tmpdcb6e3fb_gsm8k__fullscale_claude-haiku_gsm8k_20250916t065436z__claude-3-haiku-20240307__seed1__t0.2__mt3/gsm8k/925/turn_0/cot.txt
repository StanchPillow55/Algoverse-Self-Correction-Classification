Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool.
- Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool.
- The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the tank.
Amount of water in the tank = 1/2 × 10,000 gallons = 5,000 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water remaining in the tank after 6 days.
Amount of water remaining in the tank = Initial amount of water - (Rate of water usage × Number of days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - (500 gallons/day × 6 days)
Amount of water remaining in the tank = 5,000 gallons - 3,000 gallons = 2,000 gallons

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

Final answer: 2,
