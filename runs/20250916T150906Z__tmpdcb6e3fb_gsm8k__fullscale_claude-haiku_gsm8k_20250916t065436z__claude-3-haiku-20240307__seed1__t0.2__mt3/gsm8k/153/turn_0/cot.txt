To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final amount of french fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

Given information:
- Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.
- The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate.
- Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
- The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
- Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fries the seagull ate.
Seagull ate = 1/2 × 14 = 7 fries

Step 2: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the seagull's theft.
Remaining fries = 14 - 7 = 7 fries

Step 3: Calculate the number of fries eaten by the three pigeons.
Pigeons ate = 3 × 3 = 9 fries

Step 4: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the pigeons' theft.
