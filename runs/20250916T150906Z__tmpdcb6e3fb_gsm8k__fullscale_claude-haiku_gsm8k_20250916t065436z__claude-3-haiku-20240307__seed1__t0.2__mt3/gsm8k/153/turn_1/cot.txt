Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the pack.

2. The seagull then ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - Dave's eaten - Seagull's eaten
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 14 - 7 = Original amount - 21

3. Three pigeons then each ate 3 fries, so 3 x 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 21 - 9 = Original amount - 30

4. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 30
   * Raccoon took two-thirds of (Original amount - 30)
   * Remaining fries = (Original amount - 30) - (2/3 * (Original amount - 30))
   * Remaining
