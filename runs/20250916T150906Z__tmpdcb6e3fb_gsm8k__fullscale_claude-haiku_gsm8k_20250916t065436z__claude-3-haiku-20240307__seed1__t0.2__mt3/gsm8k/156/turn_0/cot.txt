Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.
- The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the total monthly requirement and then multiply it by 2.

Step 1: Calculate the total monthly requirement.
Monkeys' monthly requirement = 200 bananas
Gorillas' monthly requirement = 400 bananas
Baboons' monthly requirement = 100 bananas
Total monthly requirement = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

Step 2: Calculate the total requirement for 2 months.
Total requirement for 2 months = Total monthly requirement × 2
Total requirement for 2 months = 700 bananas × 2 = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for
