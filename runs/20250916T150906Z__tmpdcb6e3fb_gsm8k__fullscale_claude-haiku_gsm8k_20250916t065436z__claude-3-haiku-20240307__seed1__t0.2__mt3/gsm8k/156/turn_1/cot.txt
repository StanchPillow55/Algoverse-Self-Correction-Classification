Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know the following:
   - Monkeys need 200 bananas per month
   - Gorillas need 400 bananas per month
   - Baboons need 100 bananas per month
   - The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months

2. To calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to add up the monthly requirements for each type of ape and multiply by 2 months.

   Monkeys: 200 bananas/month x 2 months = 400 bananas
   Gorillas: 400 bananas/month x 2 months = 800 bananas
   Baboons: 100 bananas/month x 2 months = 200 bananas

3. Now we add up the total bananas needed for all the apes:
   400 + 800 + 200 = 1,400 bananas

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1,400 bananas to last for 2 months.
