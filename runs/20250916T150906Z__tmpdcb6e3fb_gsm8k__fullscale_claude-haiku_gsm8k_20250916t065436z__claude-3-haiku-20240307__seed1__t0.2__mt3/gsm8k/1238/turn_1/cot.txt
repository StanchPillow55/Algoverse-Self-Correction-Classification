Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bud makes homemade macaroni and cheese once a week.
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
- Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese.
Cost of gruyere cheese = 2 × $3.00 = $6.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of ingredients per week.
Cost of pasta per week = $1.00
Cost of cheddar cheese per week = $3.00
Cost of gruyere cheese per week = $6.00
Total cost of ingredients per week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of ingredients in one year.
There are 52 weeks in a year.
Total cost of ingredients in one year = $10.00 × 52 =
