To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a year.

Given information:
- The pasta costs $1.00 per box.
- Bud spends $3.00 on cheddar cheese.
- Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese as he does on cheddar cheese.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the gruyere cheese.
Cost of gruyere cheese = 2 × $3.00 = $6.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese per week.
Total cost per week = Cost of pasta + Cost of cheddar cheese + Cost of gruyere cheese
Total cost per week = $1.00 + $3.00 + $6.00 = $10.00

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese in one year.
Number of weeks in a year = 52 weeks
Total cost in one year = Total cost per week × Number of weeks in a year
Total cost in one year
