To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day and then calculate the number of flights to France.

Given information:
- The first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.
- The remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany.
- The second plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.

Step 1: Find the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
Let the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day be x.
Three-quarters of the flights go to Greece, so the number of flights to Greece is 3/4 × x.
The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany, so the number of flights to each is (1/4 × x) / 2 = 1/8 × x.

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.
Therefore, 2 × 44 = x
x = 88 flights

Step 2: Calculate the number of flights to
