Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. James buys 10 suits at $750 each:
   * 10 suits x $750 per suit = $7,500

2. James buys 10 dress pants, which cost 1/5 the cost of a suit:
   * 1/5 of $750 = $150 per dress pant
   * 10 dress pants x $150 per pant = $1,500

3. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, at $60 each:
   * 10 suits x 3 shirts per suit = 30 shirts
   * 30 shirts x $60 per shirt = $1,800

4. Adding up the total cost:
   * Suits: $7,500
   * Dress pants: $1,500
   * Dress shirts: $1,800
   * Total cost: $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800 = $10,800

Therefore, the total cost of James' new wardrobe is $10,
