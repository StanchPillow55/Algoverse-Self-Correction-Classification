Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- James buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants.
- He buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- The suits cost $750 each.
- The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits.
- The dress shirts cost $60 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits.
Cost of 10 suits = 10 × $750 = $7,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants.
Cost of 1 dress pant = 1/5 × $750 = $150
Cost of 10 dress pants = 10 × $150 = $1,500

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts.
Number of dress shirts = 10 suits × 3 shirts per suit = 30 dress shirts
Cost of 30 dress shirts = 30 × $60 = $1,800

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of suits + Cost of dress pants + Cost of dress
