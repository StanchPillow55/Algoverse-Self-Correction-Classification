Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- James buys 10 suits and 10 dress pants.
- He buys 3 dress shirts per suit.
- The suits cost $750 each.
- The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits.
- The dress shirts cost $60 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the suits.
Total cost of suits = 10 suits × $750 per suit = $7,500

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants.
Cost of each dress pant = 1/5 × $750 = $150
Total cost of dress pants = 10 dress pants × $150 per pant = $1,500

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the dress shirts.
Total number of dress shirts = 10 suits × 3 shirts per suit = 30 shirts
Total cost of dress shirts = 30 shirts × $60 per shirt = $1,800

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of everything.
Total cost = Total cost of suits +
