Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.
- Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
- Movie C was 1.25 hours.

Step 1: Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes.
Movie C was 1.25 hours
1.25 hours = 1 hour and 15 minutes
1 hour = 60 minutes
1.25 hours = 75 minutes

Step 2: Find the length of Movie B.
Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
Length of Movie B = Length of Movie C + 5 minutes
Length of Movie B = 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

Step 3: Find the length of Movie A.
Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.
Length of Movie A = Length of Movie B / 4
Length of Movie A = 80 minutes / 4 = 20 minutes

Therefore, Movie A was 20 minutes long.
