Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 schools competing in the basketball tournament.
- Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to calculate the number of players and coaches.

Step 1: Calculate the number of players.
Number of players per team = 5
Number of teams per school = 2 (girls' team and boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of players = 5 players per team × 2 teams per school × 4 schools = 40 players

Step 2: Calculate the number of coaches.
Number of coaches per school = 2 (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of coaches = 2 coaches per school × 4 schools = 8 coaches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people sent by all the schools.
