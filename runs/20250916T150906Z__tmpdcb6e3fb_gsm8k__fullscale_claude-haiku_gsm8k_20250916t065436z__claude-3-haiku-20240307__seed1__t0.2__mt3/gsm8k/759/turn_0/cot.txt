Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The number of songs in a playlist is 300.
- John has 20 such playlists.
- Each song is 10 hours long.

To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in the 20 playlists.
Total number of songs = Number of songs per playlist × Number of playlists
Total number of songs = 300 × 20 = 6,000 songs

Step 2: Calculate the total duration of all the songs.
Total duration of songs = Number of songs × Duration of each song
Total duration of songs = 6,000 songs × 10 hours per song = 60,000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours.

Final answer: The 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours.
