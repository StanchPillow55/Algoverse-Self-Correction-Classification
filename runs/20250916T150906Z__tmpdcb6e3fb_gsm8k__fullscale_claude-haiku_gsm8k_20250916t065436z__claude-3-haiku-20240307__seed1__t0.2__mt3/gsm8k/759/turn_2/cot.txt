Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The number of songs in a playlist is 300.
2. John has 20 such playlists.
3. Each song is 10 hours long.

To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to:
* Calculate the total number of songs in the 20 playlists
* Multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song

Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in the 20 playlists.
* Total number of songs = 300 songs per playlist x 20 playlists = 6,000 songs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last.
* Total number of hours = 6,000 songs x 10 hours per song = 60,000 hours

Therefore, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours.
