Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Kim has 3 current clients and is talking to 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 8 clients.
2. Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
3. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is $2 x 2 = $4 per client.
4. The cost of 1 pack of cloths is $5 per client.
5. The total expense per client is $4 + $5 = $9.
6. With 8 clients, the total weekly expenses are 8 x $9 = $72.
7. Kim's total weekly income is $92.
8. The profit is the difference between the total income and total expenses.
9. Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses
10. Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, the profit that Kim will make each week is $20.
