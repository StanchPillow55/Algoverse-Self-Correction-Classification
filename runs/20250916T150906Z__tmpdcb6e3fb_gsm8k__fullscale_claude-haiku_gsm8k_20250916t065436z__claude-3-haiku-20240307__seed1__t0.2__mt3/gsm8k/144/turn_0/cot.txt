To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total expenses and the total income, and then find the difference between them to determine the weekly profit.

Given information:
- Kim has 3 existing clients and is talking to 5 potential clients.
- Each client's home needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths.
- Bottles of bleach cost $2 each, and packs of cloths cost $5 each.
- Kim's total income each week is $92.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of clients.
Total number of clients = 3 existing clients + 5 potential clients = 8 clients

Step 2: Calculate the total expenses per week.
Expenses for bleach:
Total bottles of bleach needed = 8 clients × 2 bottles per client = 16 bottles
Total cost of bleach = 16 bottles × $2 per bottle = $32

Expenses for cloths:
Total packs of cloths needed = 8 clients × 1 pack per client = 8 packs
Total cost of cloths = 8 packs × $5
