To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish and the time it takes with the old varnish, then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.
- With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.
- Louise needs to apply the coat of varnish to 6 paintings.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish.
Time for 1 painting with old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with old varnish = 6 Ã— 7 minutes = 42 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish.
Time for 1 painting with new varnish = 12 minutes
Time for
