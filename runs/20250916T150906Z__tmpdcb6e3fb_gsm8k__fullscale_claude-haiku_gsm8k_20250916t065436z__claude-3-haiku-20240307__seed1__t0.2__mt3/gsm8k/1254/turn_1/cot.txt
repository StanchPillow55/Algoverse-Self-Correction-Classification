Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- With the old varnish, it takes 7 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.
- With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for the coat to dry on one painting.
- Louise needs to apply the coat of varnish to 6 paintings.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it would take for the 6 paintings to dry with the old varnish.
Time for 1 painting with old varnish = 7 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with old varnish = 6 × 7 minutes = 42 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it would take for the 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish.
Time for 1 painting with new varnish = 12 minutes
Time for 6 paintings with new varnish = 6 × 12 minutes = 72 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the new varnish and the old varnish.
Time difference = Time with new varn
