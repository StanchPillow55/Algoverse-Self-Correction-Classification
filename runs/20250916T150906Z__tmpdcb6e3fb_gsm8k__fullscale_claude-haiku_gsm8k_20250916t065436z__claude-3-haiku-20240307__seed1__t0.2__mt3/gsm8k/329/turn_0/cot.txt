Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Erin initially has 7 lollipops.
- Erin's mother gives her 10 more lollipops.
- Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more.
Initial number of lollipops + Number of lollipops given by mother = Total number of lollipops
7 + 10 = 17 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops Erin has left after giving 3 to Ella.
Total number of lollipops - Number of lollipops given to Ella = Number of lollipops Erin has left
17 - 3 = 14 lollipops

Therefore, the final answer is that Erin has 14 lollipops left.
