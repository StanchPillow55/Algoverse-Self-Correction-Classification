Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs.
- Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his player.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel on his player.

Step 1: Find out how many songs Luri has on his player.
Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs

Step 2: Find out how many more songs Gabriel can add to his player.
Gabriel's player capacity - Gabriel's current songs = Songs Gabriel can add
100 - 20 = 80 songs

Step 3: Find out how many more songs Luri can add to his player.
Luri's player capacity - Luri's current songs = Songs Luri can add
100 - 60 = 40 songs

Step 4: Find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add.
Songs Gabriel can add - Songs Luri can add =
