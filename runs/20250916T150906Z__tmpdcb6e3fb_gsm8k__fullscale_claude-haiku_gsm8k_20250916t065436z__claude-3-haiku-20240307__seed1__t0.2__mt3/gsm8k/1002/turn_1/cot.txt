Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
- Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars.

To find the number of chocolate bars in a box, we need to set up an equation and solve for the unknown.

Step 1: Find the total number of boxes sold.
Total boxes sold = Lisa's boxes + Peter's boxes
Total boxes sold = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of chocolate bars sold.
Total chocolate bars sold = Number of chocolate bars per box × Total boxes sold
64 = Number of chocolate bars per box × 8

Step 3: Solve for the number of chocolate bars per box.
64 = Number of chocolate bars per box × 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 64 / 8
Number of chocolate bars per box = 8

Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in a box is 8.
