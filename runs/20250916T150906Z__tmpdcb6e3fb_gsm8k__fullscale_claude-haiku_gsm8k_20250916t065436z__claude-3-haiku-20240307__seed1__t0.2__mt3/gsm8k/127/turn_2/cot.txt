Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Amy made 20 more friends than Lily.
- Lily made 50 friends.

Step 1: Find the number of friends Amy made.
Amy's friends = Lily's friends + 20
Amy's friends = 50 + 20 = 70 friends

Step 2: Find the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together.
Total friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total friends = 50 + 70 = 120 friends

Therefore, Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together.
