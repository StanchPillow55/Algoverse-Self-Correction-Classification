   * Total days worked per year: 5 x 50 = 250 days

3. Total miles driven per year:
   * Miles per day: 60 miles
   * Days worked per year: 250 days
   * Total miles driven per year: 60 x 250 = 15,000 miles

4. Cost per mile:
   * Cost per mile: $2

5. Bonus per month:
   * Bonus per month: $150

6. Total cost per year:
