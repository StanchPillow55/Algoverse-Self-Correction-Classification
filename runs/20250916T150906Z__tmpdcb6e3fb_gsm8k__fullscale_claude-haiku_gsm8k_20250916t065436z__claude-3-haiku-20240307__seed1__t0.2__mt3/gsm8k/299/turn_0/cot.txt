To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the driving service for John per year.

Given information:
- John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back each day.
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year.
- He gets charged $2 per mile driven.
- He also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance John travels per day.
Distance to work + Distance from work = Total distance per day
30 miles + 30 miles = 60 miles per day

Step 2: Calculate the total distance John travels per week.
Total distance per day × Number of days per week = Total distance per week
60 miles × 5 days = 300 miles per week

Step 3: Calculate the total distance John travels per year.
Total distance per week × Number of weeks per year = Total distance per year
300 miles × 50 weeks = 15,000 miles per year

Step 4: Calculate the cost per mile.
Cost per mile = $2

Step 5: Calculate
