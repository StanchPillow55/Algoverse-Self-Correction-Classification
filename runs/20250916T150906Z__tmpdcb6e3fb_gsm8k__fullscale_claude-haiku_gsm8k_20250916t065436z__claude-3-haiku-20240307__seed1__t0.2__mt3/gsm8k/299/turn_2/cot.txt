Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John's work is 30 miles away
- He has to go there and back each day
- He goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year
- He gets charged $2 per mile driven
- He also gives his driver a $150 bonus per month

Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven per day
Total miles driven per day = 30 miles (to work) + 30 miles (back home) = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total miles driven per week
Total miles driven per week = 60 miles per day × 5 days per week = 300 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total miles driven per year
Total miles driven per year = 300 miles per week × 50 weeks per year = 15,000 miles

Step 4: Calculate the cost per mile
Cost per mile = $2 per mile

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the miles driven per year
Total cost for miles driven per year = 15,000 miles × $2 per
