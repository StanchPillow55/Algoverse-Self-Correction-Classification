Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet makes $10 per hour from wages
- Janet makes $15 per hour from tips
- Janet wants to save 20% of a $10,000 car for a down payment
- Janet works 40 hours per week

Step 1: Calculate Janet's total hourly rate.
Hourly wage + Hourly tips = Total hourly rate
$10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Step 2: Calculate the down payment amount Janet needs to save.
20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings.
Total hourly rate × Hours worked per week = Weekly earnings
$25 × 40 hours = $1,000 per week

Step 4: Calculate how many weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment.
Down payment amount / Weekly earnings = Number of weeks
$2,000 / $1,000 per week = 2 weeks

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks
