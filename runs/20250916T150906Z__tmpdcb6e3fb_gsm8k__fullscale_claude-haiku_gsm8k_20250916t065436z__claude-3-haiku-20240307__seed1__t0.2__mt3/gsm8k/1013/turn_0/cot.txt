To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment and then calculate the number of weeks she needs to work to save that amount.

Given information:
- Janet makes $10 per hour from wages.
- Janet makes $15 per hour from tips.
- Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car for a down payment.
- Janet works 40 hours per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janet needs to save for the down payment.
Down payment = 20% of $10,000 = 0.20 × $10,000 = $2,000

Step 2: Calculate Janet's total hourly rate.
Total hourly rate = Wages per hour + Tips per hour = $10 + $15 = $25 per hour

Step 3: Calculate Janet's weekly earnings.
Weekly earnings = Total hourly rate × Hours worked per week = $25 × 40 = $1,000 per week

Step 4: Calculate the number of weeks Janet needs to work to save the down payment.
Number of weeks = Down payment
