Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.
- There are 16 weeks in one semester.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Number of classes per day = 3
Duration of each class = 1 hour
Number of days per week = 3 (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
Total hours per week = 3 classes × 1 hour × 3 days = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends in classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Number of classes per day = 2
Duration of each class = 2 hours
Number of days per week = 2 (Tuesday, Thursday)
Total hours per week = 2 classes × 2 hours
