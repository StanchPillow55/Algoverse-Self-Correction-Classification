Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes that are each 1 hour long.
   * So on those days, he spends 3 hours in class.
   * There are 3 days per week like this, so that's 3 hours x 3 days = 9 hours per week.

2. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes that are each 2 hours long.
   * So on those days, he spends 4 hours in class.
   * There are 2 days per week like this, so that's 4 hours x 2 days = 8 hours per week.

3. In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.
   * For the Monday/Wednesday/Friday classes, that's 9 hours per week x 16 weeks = 144 hours.
   * For the Tuesday/Thursday classes, that's 8 hours per week x 16 weeks = 128
