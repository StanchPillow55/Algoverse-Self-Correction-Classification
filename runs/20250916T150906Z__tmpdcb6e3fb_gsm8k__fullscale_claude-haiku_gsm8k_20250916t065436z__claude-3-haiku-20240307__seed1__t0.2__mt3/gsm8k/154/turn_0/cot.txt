To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.

Given information:
- On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.
- On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.
- There are 16 weeks of school in one semester.

Total hours for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in one semester = 9 hours per week × 16 weeks = 144 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Number of classes per day × Number of hours per class × Number of days per
