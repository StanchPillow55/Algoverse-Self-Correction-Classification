Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Baldur gets 5 pails of water every morning.
- Baldur gets 6 pails of water every afternoon.
- Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pails of water Baldur gets every day.
Morning pails of water + Afternoon pails of water = Total pails of water per day
5 pails + 6 pails = 11 pails

Step 2: Calculate the total liters of water Baldur gets every day.
Total pails of water per day × Liters per pail = Total liters of water per day
11 pails × 5 liters per pail = 55 liters

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.

Final answer: Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.
