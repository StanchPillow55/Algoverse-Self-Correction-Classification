Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 now.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, we can subtract 20 years from John's current age to find his age when Digimon came out.
John's age when Digimon came out = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
We know that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
Jim's age when Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out / 2
Jim's age when Digimon came out = 8 / 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Determine Jim's current age.
Since 20 years have passed since Digimon came out, we can
