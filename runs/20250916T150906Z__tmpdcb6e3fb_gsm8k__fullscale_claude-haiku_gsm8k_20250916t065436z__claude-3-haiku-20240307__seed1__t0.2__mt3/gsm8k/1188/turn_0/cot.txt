To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age based on the given information about John's age.

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 now.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
John's age now - Years since Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out
28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
Since John was twice as old as Jim when Digimon came out, we can divide John's age by 2 to find Jim's age.
John's age when Digimon came out / 2 = Jim's age when Digimon came out
8 / 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Determine Jim's current age.
Jim's age when Digimon came out + Years since Digimon came out = Jim's current age
4 + 20
