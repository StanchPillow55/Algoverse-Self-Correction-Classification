Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads.
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost of newspaper ads = $5 × 50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the television ads.
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost of television ads = $75 × 15 = $1,125

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the ads.
Total cost = Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1,125 = $1,375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1,375 on buying all the ads.
