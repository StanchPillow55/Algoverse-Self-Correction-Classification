Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
2. He bought 50 newspaper ads.
3. So the total cost of the newspaper ads is:
   * 50 newspaper ads x $5 per ad = $250

4. The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad.
5. He bought 15 television ads.
6. So the total cost of the television ads is:
   * 15 television ads x $75 per ad = $1,125

7. To find the total amount spent on all the ads, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and television ads:
   * $250 + $1,125 = $1,375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1,375 on buying all the ads.
