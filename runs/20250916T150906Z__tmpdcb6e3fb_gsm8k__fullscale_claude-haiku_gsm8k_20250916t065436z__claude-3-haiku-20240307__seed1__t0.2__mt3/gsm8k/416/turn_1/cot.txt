Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 bumps in total.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of camels
- Let y = the number of dromedaries

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Total number of heads:
   x + y = 180 (since each animal has 1 head)

2. Total number of bumps:
   2x + y = 304 (since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the number of dromedaries.

Step 1: Solve for x in the first equation.
x + y = 180
x = 180 - y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for x in the second equation.
