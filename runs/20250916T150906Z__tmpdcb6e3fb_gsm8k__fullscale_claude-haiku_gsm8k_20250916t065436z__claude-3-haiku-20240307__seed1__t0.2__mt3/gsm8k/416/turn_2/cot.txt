Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads in the herd.
- There are 304 bumps in the herd.
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of camels in the herd.
- Let y be the number of dromedaries in the herd.

We can set up two equations to solve for x and y:

1. Total number of heads:
   x + y = 180 (since each animal has one head)

2. Total number of bumps:
   2x + y = 304 (since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each)

Now, we can solve this system of equations:

Step 1: Solve for x in the first equation.
x + y = 180
x = 180 - y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for x in the second equation.
2(180 -
