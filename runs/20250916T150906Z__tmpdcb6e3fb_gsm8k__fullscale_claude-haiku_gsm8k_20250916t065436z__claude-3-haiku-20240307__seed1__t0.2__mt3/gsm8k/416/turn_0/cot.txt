To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of dromedaries.

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads (animals) in the herd.
- There are 304 bumps (humps) in the herd.
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of camels.
- Let y be the number of dromedaries.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the total number of heads (animals) in the herd.
Total number of heads = Number of camels + Number of dromedaries
180 = x + y

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the total number of bumps (humps) in the herd.
Total number of bumps = (Number of camels × 2) + (Number of dromedaries × 1)
304 = 2x + y

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to
