Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 50 socks that need washing.
- Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of socks washed.
Number of socks in 10 pairs = 10 Ã— 2 = 20 socks
Number of loose socks = 15 socks
Total number of socks washed = 20 + 15 = 35 socks

Step 2: Calculate the number of socks missed.
Total socks that need washing = 50 socks
Total socks washed = 35 socks
Number of socks missed = Total socks that need washing - Total socks washed
Number of socks missed = 50 - 35 = 15 socks

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.
