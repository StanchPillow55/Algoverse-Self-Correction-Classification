Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, the number of people increased by 20 compared to the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day.
- For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the second day.
Number of people on the second day = Number of people on the first day + 20
Number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the third day.
Number of people on the third day = 2 × Number of people on the second day
Number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140 people

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach for the rest of the week.
Number of days
