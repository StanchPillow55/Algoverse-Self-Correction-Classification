Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes was 37 centimeters.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
- Then the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the length of the red rope.

The combined length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters, so:
x + 4x + (x + 7) = 37

Simplifying the equation:
6x + 7 = 37
6x = 30
x = 5

Therefore, the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.

Now, we can calculate the length of the red rope:
Length of the red rope = 4 Ã—
