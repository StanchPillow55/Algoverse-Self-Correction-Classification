Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red rope was 4 times the length of the blue rope.
- The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.
- The combined length of the 3 ropes was 37 centimeters.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the length of the blue rope be x centimeters.
- Then the length of the red rope is 4x centimeters.
- The length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters.

Step 1: Write an equation for the combined length of the 3 ropes.
Combined length = Length of red rope + Length of blue rope + Length of yellow rope
37 = 4x + x + (x + 7)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
37 = 6x + 7

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
37 - 7 = 6x
30 = 6x
x = 5 centimeters

Step 4: Calculate the length of the red rope
