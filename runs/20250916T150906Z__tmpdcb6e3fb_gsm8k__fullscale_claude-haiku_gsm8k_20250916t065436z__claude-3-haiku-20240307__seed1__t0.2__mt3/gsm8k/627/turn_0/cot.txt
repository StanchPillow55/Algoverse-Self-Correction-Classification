To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The tow truck pulled 10 cars for each of the first three days.
- The tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cars towed on the first three days.
Number of cars towed on the first three days = 10 cars × 3 days = 30 cars

Step 2: Calculate the number of cars towed on the remaining days of the week.
Assuming the week has 7 days, the remaining days would be 4 days.
Number of cars towed on each of the remaining 4 days = 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars
Total number of cars towed on the remaining 4 days = 6 cars × 4 days = 24 cars

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars towed that week.
Total number of cars towed = Number of cars towed on the first three days + Number of cars towed on the remaining days
Total number of
