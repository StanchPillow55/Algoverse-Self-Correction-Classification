Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, two more than the number of Petri dishes requested.
- Igor lost several beakers on the way to the lab bench.
- The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29.

Step 1: Calculate the number of test tubes Igor gathered.
Number of test tubes requested = 16
Number of test tubes Igor gathered = 16 / 2 = 8

Step 2: Calculate the number of Petri dishes Igor gathered.
Number of Petri dishes requested = 14
Number of Petri dishes Igor gathered = 14 + 2 = 16

Step 3: Calculate the total number of items Igor gathered.
Total items gathered = Number of test tubes + Number of beakers + Number of Petri dishes
Total items gathered = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31

Step 4: Calculate the number of be
