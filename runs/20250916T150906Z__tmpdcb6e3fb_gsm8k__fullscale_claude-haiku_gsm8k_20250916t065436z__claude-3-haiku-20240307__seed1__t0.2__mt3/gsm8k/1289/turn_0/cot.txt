Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Small t-shirt = 3 square feet of fabric
- Medium t-shirt = 4 square feet of fabric
- Large t-shirt = 6 square feet of fabric
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts

To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the area contributed by the small t-shirts.
Area of small t-shirts = 11 shirts × 3 square feet per shirt = 33 square feet

Step 2: Calculate the area contributed by the medium t-shirts.
Area of medium t-shirts = 8 shirts × 4 square feet per shirt = 32 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the area contributed by the large t-shirts.
Area of large t-shirts = 6 shirts × 6 square feet per shirt = 36 square feet

Step 4: Calculate the total area of the quilt.
