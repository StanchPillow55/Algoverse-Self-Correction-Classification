Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.
- The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.

To find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes for each slide and then find the difference.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time for biggest slide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time for second biggest slide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Step 3: Find the difference in time between the two slides.
Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the
