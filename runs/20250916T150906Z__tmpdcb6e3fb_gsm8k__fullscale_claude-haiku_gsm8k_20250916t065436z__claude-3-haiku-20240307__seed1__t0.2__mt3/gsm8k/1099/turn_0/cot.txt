To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to ride each waterslide and then calculate the difference between the two.

Given information:
- The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.
- The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest waterslide.
Time to ride the biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Sliding speed
Time to ride the biggest waterslide = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest waterslide.
Time to ride the second biggest waterslide = Length of the slide / Sliding speed
Time to ride the second biggest waterslide = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between the two slides.
Difference in time = Time to ride the biggest waterslide - Time to ride the second biggest waterslide
Difference in time
