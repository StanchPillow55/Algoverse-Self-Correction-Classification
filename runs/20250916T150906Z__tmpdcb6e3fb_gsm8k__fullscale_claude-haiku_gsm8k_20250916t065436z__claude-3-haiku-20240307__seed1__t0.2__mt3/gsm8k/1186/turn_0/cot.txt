Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- Sam ran 5 miles on Tuesday and Thursday.

To find the total miles Sam ran this week, we need to add up the miles he ran on each day.

Step 1: Calculate the miles Sam ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Miles ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday = 3 miles × 3 days = 9 miles

Step 2: Calculate the miles Sam ran on Tuesday and Thursday.
Miles ran on Tuesday and Thursday = 5 miles × 2 days = 10 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total miles Sam ran this week.
Total miles ran this week = Miles ran on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday + Miles ran on Tuesday and Thursday
Total miles ran this week = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

Therefore, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.

Final answer: Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.
