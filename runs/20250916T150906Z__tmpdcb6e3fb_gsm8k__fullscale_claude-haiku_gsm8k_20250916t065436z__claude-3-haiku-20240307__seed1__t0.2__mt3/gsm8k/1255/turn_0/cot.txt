To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water required for all of Crista's plants.

Given information:
- Crista has 20 plants.
- 4 plants need half a cup of water.
- 8 plants need 1 cup of water.
- The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water needed for the 4 plants that need half a cup of water.
Amount of water needed for 4 plants = 4 × 0.5 cup = 2 cups

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water needed for the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water.
Amount of water needed for 8 plants = 8 × 1 cup = 8 cups

Step 3: Calculate the number of plants that need a quarter of a cup of water.
Total number of plants - (4 plants that need half a cup + 8 plants that need 1 cup) = 20 - (4 + 8) = 8 plants

Step 4: Calculate the amount of water neede
