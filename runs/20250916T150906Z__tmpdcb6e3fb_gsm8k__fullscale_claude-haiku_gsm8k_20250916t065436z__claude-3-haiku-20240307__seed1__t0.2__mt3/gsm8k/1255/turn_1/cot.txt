Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Crista has a total of 20 plants.
2. 4 of her plants need half a cup of water each.
   * 4 plants x 0.5 cups = 2 cups

3. 8 of her plants need 1 cup of water each.
   * 8 plants x 1 cup = 8 cups

4. The remaining 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.
   * 8 plants x 0.25 cups = 2 cups

5. To find the total amount of water needed, we add up the amounts for each group:
   * 2 cups + 8 cups + 2 cups = 12 cups

Therefore, the total amount of water Crista needs every day for her 20 plants is 12 cups.
