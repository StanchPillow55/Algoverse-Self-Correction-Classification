Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.
- He gets 1 hour free.
- The first paid hour is $15.
- Each hour after that is twice the cost of the previous hour.

Step 1: Determine the total number of hours James hired the carriage.
Total hours = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours

Step 2: Determine the number of paid hours.
Paid hours = Total hours - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 paid hours

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the first paid hour.
Cost of first paid hour = $15

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the second paid hour.
Cost of second paid hour = 2 × $15 = $30

Step 5: Calculate the cost of the third paid hour.
Cost of third paid hour = 2 × $30 = $60

Step 6: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of first paid hour + Cost
