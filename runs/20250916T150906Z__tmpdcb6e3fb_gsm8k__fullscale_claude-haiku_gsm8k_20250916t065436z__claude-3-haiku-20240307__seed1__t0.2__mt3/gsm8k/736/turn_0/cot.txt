Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
- Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Step 1: Calculate how many apples Beck has initially.
Beck's initial apples = Boris' apples - 23
Beck's initial apples = 100 - 23 = 77 apples

Step 2: Calculate how many apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples.
Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = Beck's initial apples + 10
Beck's apples after receiving 10 from Boris = 77 + 10 = 87 apples

Step 3: Calculate how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.
Boris' apples after giving 10 to Beck = 100 - 10 = 90 apples
Difference in apples between Boris and Beck = Boris' apples - Beck's apples
Difference in apples between Boris and Beck = 90 - 87 = 3 apples
