Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initially, Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
   * Boris: 100 apples
   * Beck: 100 - 23 = 77 apples

2. Boris gives Beck 10 apples.
   * Boris now has: 100 - 10 = 90 apples
   * Beck now has: 77 + 10 = 87 apples

3. Now, we need to find how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.
   * Boris has 90 apples
   * Beck has 87 apples
   * Difference: 90 - 87 = 3 apples

Therefore, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.

Final answer: Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.
