To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boys and girls in the third class.

Given information:
- Each class has 20 students.
- There are 3 classes in the school.
- The school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls.
- The first class has 15 girls.
- The second class has 12 girls.

Step 1: Find the total number of students in the school.
Total number of students = Number of students per class × Number of classes
Total number of students = 20 × 3 = 60 students

Step 2: Find the number of boys and girls in the school.
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys and girls is equal.
Number of boys = Number of girls = 60 / 2 = 30 students

Step 3: Find the number of girls in the first two classes.
Number of girls in the first class = 15
Number of girls in the second class = 12
Total number of girls in the first two classes = 15 + 12 = 27 students
