Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each class has 20 students.
2. There are 3 classes in total.
3. The school is 50% boys and 50% girls.
4. The first class has 15 girls.
5. The second class has 12 girls.

To find the number of boys in the third class, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of students in the school.
2. Calculate the total number of girls in the school.
3. Calculate the total number of boys in the school.
4. Subtract the number of boys in the first two classes from the total number of boys to get the number of boys in the third class.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Total students = 3 classes x 20 students per class = 60 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of girls in the school.
Total girls = 15 (in first class) + 12 (in second class) + (60 - 15 - 12) = 33 girls

Step 3:
