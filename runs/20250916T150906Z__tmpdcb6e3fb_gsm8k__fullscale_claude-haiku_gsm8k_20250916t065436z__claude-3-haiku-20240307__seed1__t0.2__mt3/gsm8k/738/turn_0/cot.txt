Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
- Clara has 20 books.

Step 1: Find the number of books Steven has.
Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has.
Clara's books = 2 × Steven's books
20 = 2 × Steven's books
Steven's books = 20 / 2 = 10 books

Step 2: Find the number of books Alice has.
Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so:
Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
Alice's books = 10 + 6 = 16 books

Step 3: Find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.
Difference = Clara's books - Alice's books
Difference = 20 - 16 = 4 books

Therefore, Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Final answer: Clara
