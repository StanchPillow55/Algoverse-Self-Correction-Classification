Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Steve is 60 years old.
- Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
- Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
- Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.

Step 1: Find the age of Steve's wife.
Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4 years
Steve's wife's age = 60 + 4 = 64 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Steve's son.
Steve's son's age = Steve's wife's age / 2
Steve's son's age = 64 / 2 = 32 years old

Step 3: Find the age of Steve's son's wife.
Steve's son's wife's age = Steve's son's age - 3 years
Steve's son's wife's age = 32 - 3 = 29 years old

Therefore, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.
