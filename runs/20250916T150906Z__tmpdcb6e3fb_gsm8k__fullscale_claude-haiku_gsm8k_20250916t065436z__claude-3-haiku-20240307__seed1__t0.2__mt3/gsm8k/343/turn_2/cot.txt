Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day.
- We need to find the total distance he covered in June.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run per day based on his coach's advice.
Additional distance per day = 1/5 × 5000 meters = 1000 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs per day with the coach's advice.
Total distance per day = 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June.
Number of days in June = 30 days
Total distance covered in June = 6000 meters × 30 days = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June, following his coach's advice, is 180,000 meters.
