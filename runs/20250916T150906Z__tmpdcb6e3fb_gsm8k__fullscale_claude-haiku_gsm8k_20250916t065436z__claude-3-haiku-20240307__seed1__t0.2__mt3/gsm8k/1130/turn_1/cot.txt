Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nik has 200 crayons.
2. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.
3. Each box weighs 8 ounces.
4. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
5. There are 16 ounces in a pound.

First, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need to hold all 200 crayons.
* 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the crayons:
* 200 crayons x 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Next, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes:
* 25 boxes x 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Finally, we can calculate the total weight in pounds:
* (200 ounces + 200 ounces) / 16 ounces per pound = 25
