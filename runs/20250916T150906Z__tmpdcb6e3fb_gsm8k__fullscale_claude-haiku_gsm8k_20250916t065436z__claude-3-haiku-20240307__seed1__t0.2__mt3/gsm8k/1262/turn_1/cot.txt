Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).
- After training, his speaking speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.
- He needs to speak 10 pages, and each page has 450 words.

Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
John's new speaking speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.
Total words = 10 pages × 450 words per page = 4,500 words

Step 3: Calculate the time it would take John to speak 4,500 words at his new speaking speed.
Time taken = Total words / Speaking speed
Time taken = 4,500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages, where each page has 450 words.
