To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
2. Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.
3. Calculate the time it takes John to speak 10 pages.

Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.
* John's normal speaking speed is 150 WPM (words per minute).
* After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his starting speed.
* New speaking speed = 150 WPM × 2.5 = 375 WPM

Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.
* Each page has 450 words.
* Total number of words in 10 pages = 10 × 450 = 4,500 words

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes John to speak 10 pages.
* Total number of words = 4,500 words
* John's new speaking speed = 375 WPM
* Time to speak 10 pages = Total number of words / Speaking speed
* Time to speak 10
