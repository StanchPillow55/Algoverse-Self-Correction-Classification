Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
- There are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
- There are 30 days in a month.

Step 1: Calculate how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe per day.
Bare hands: 12 pounds per day
Iron pickaxe: 2 × 12 = 24 pounds per day
Steel pickaxe: 1.5 × 24 = 36 pounds per day

Step 2: Calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickaxes in a day.
40 dwarves × 36 pounds per day = 1,440 pounds per day

Step 3: Calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine with steel pickax
