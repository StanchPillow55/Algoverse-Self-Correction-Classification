Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
- With an iron pickaxe, a dwarf can mine twice as much as with bare hands.
- With a steel pickaxe, a dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.
- There are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.
- The time period is 1 month with 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of ore 1 dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.
Ore mined with bare hands per day = 12 pounds
Ore mined with iron pickaxe per day = 12 pounds × 2 = 24 pounds
Ore mined with steel pickaxe per day = 24 pounds × 1.5 = 36 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of ore 40 dwarves can mine in 1 day with steel pickaxes.
Ore mined per day by 40
