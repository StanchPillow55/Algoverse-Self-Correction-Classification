Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with his bare hands.
2. With an iron pickaxe, the dwarf can mine twice as much, which is 24 pounds of ore per day.
3. With a steel pickaxe, the dwarf can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, which is 24 + (0.5 x 24) = 36 pounds of ore per day.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month (30 days):
* 1 dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 pounds of ore per day
* 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 x 36 = 1,440 pounds of ore per day
* In a month (30 days), they can mine 1,440 x 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore

Therefore, the final answer is:
43,200 pounds of ore
