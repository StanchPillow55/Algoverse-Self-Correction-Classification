Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon.
- The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
- The person is buying 10 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the gas before the cashback reward.
Total cost of gas = Number of gallons × Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons × $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback reward.
Cashback reward = Number of gallons × Cashback per gallon
Cashback reward = 10 gallons × $0.20 per gallon = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the final cost of the gas after the cashback reward.
Final cost of gas = Total cost of gas - Cashback reward
Final cost of gas = $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00

Therefore, the final cost of the gas, after the cashback reward, will be $28.00
