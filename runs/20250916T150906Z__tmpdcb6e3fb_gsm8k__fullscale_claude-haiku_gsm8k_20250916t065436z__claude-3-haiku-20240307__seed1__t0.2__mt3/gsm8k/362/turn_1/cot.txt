Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
2. A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
3. A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
   * The average of 8 pounds (Rottweiler) and 2 pounds (chihuahua) is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.
4. Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.
   * For the 4 chihuahua beds, he needs 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
   * For the 3 collie beds, he needs 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.
5. The total amount of stuffing Mark needs is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.

Therefore, the final answer is that Mark needs 23
