Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A bed for a Rottweiler takes 8 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a chihuahua takes 2 pounds of stuffing.
- A bed for a collie takes the average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler and chihuahua beds.
- Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

Stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds = 4 Ã— 2 pounds = 8 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed.
Average stuffing = (Rottweiler bed + chihuahua bed) / 2
Average stuffing = (8 pounds + 2 pounds) / 2 = 5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the collie
