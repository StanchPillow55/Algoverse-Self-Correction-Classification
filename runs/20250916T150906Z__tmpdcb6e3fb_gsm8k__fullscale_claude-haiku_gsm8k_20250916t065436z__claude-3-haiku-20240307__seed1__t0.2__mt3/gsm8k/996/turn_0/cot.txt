To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred based on the given information.

Given information:
- There are four children: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred.
- Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
- The total age of the children is 20.
- Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.

Step 1: Find the average age of the group.
Total age of the children = 20 years
Number of children = 4

Average age = Total age / Number of children
Average age = 20 / 4 = 5 years

Step 2: Find Helene's age.
Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.
Helene's age = 2 × Average age
Helene's age = 2 × 5 = 10 years

Step 3: Find Wilfred's age.
Total age of the children = 20 years
Akbar's age = 3 years
Alessandro's age = 4
