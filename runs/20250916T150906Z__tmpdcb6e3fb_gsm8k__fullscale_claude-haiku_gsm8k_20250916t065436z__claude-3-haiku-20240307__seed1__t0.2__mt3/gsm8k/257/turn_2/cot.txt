Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
- Termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.
- The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the entire redwood tree before the termites ate any of the wood.
Weight of each 10-foot section = 400 pounds
Number of 10-foot sections in a 200-foot tree = 200 feet / 10 feet per section = 20 sections
Total weight of the redwood tree = 20 sections × 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the amount of wood eaten by the termites.
Percentage of wood eaten by termites = 30%
Amount of wood eaten by termites = 8,000 pounds × 0.30 = 2,400 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the remaining weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.
Remaining weight of the redwood tree
