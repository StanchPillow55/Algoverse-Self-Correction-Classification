To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the weight of each 10-foot section of the redwood tree.
2. Calculate the weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate 30% of the wood.
3. Calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of each 10-foot section of the redwood tree.
* Each solid 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the redwood tree before the termites ate 30% of the wood.
* The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.
* Since each 10-foot section weighs 400 pounds, the total weight of the redwood tree is:
* (200 feet / 10 feet per section) Ã— 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the redwood tree after the termites ate 30% of the wood.
* The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.
* To calculate
