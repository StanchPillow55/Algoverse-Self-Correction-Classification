Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that each 10-foot section of the redwood tree weighs 400 pounds.
2. The redwood tree is 200 feet tall.
3. This means the tree has 20 sections (200 feet / 10 feet per section).
4. So the total weight of the tree before the termites ate any of the wood would be:
   * 20 sections x 400 pounds per section = 8,000 pounds

5. The termites ate 30% of the redwood's wood.
6. To calculate the weight lost due to the termites, we take 30% of the total weight:
   * 8,000 pounds x 0.30 = 2,400 pounds

7. To get the final weight of the redwood tree, we subtract the weight lost from the original weight:
   * 8,000 pounds - 2,400 pounds = 5,600 pounds

Therefore, the final weight of the 200-foot tall redwood tree is 5,600 pounds.
