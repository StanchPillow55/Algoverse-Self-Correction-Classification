To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that information to calculate the time it would take for the turtles to travel across the highway.

Given information:
- It takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- Four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, need to travel across the same highway.

Step 1: Find the speed of the kangaroos.
Let's assume the distance of the highway is 'D' units.
Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel the distance 'D', the total distance traveled by the 3 kangaroos is 3 × D units.
The speed of each kangaroo = (3 × D) / 18 = D / 6 units per hour.

Step 2: Find the speed of the turtles.
The speed of each turtle = (1/2) × (speed of each kangaroo) = (1/2) × (D / 6) = D / 12 units per hour
