Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- We need to find how many hours it will take 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to travel across the same highway.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of a single kangaroo.
Since the 3 kangaroos travel the same distance in 18 hours, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time for a single kangaroo.
Time for a single kangaroo = 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours

Step 2: Calculate the speed of a single turtle.
The turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, so their speed is 1/2 of the kangaroo's speed.
Speed of a single turtle = 1/2 Ã— Speed of a single kangaroo

Step 3: Calculate the total time for 4 turtles to travel the same distance.
