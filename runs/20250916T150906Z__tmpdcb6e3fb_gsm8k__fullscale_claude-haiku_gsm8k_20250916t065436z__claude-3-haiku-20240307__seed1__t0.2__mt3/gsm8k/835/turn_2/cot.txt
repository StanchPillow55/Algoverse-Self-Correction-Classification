Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to travel across a highway.
- 4 turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, need to travel the same distance.

To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that to calculate the speed of the turtles and the time it will take them to travel the same distance.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the kangaroos.
Since 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to travel the distance, we can calculate the speed of each kangaroo.
Let's assume the distance is D.
Speed of each kangaroo = D / 6 (since 3 kangaroos take 18 hours)

Step 2: Calculate the speed of the turtles.
Each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of each turtle = (D / 6) / 2 = D / 12.
