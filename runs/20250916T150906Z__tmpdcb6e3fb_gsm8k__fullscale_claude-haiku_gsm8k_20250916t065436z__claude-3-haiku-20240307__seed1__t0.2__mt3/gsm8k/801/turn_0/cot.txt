To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers, and then add them together.

Given information:
- Each child plants one tree.
- Each teacher plants two trees.
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students and 3 teachers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Total number of students = Number of classes × Average number of students per class
Total number of students = 40 × 25 = 1,000 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the students.
Total number of trees planted by students = Total number of students
Total number of trees planted by students = 1,000 trees

Step 3: Calculate the total number of teachers.
Total number of teachers = Number of classes × Average number of teachers per class
Total number of teachers = 40 × 3 = 120 teachers

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
Total number of trees planted by teachers = Total number of teachers × 2 trees per teacher
Total number of trees plante
