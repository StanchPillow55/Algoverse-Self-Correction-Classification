Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The school has 40 classes.
2. Each class has an average of 25 students.
3. Each class has 3 teachers.

To calculate the total number of trees planted, we need to find the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers, then add them together.

Trees planted by students:
* Each student plants 1 tree.
* There are 25 students per class.
* There are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of trees planted by students is:
   * 25 students per class x 40 classes = 1,000 trees

Trees planted by teachers:
* Each teacher plants 2 trees.
* There are 3 teachers per class.
* There are 40 classes.
* So, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:
   * 2 trees per teacher x 3 teachers per class x 40 classes = 240 trees

Total trees planted:
* Trees planted by students (1,000) + Trees planted by teachers (
