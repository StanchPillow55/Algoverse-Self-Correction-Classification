Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Each child plants 1 tree.
- Each teacher plants 2 trees.
- The school has 40 classes.
- Each class has an average of 25 students.
- Each class has 3 teachers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Number of students per class × Number of classes = Total number of students
25 students × 40 classes = 1,000 students

Step 2: Calculate the total number of teachers.
Number of teachers per class × Number of classes = Total number of teachers
3 teachers × 40 classes = 120 teachers

Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the students.
Number of students × 1 tree per student = Total trees planted by students
1,000 students × 1 tree = 1,000 trees

Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by the teachers.
Number of teachers × 2 trees per teacher = Total trees planted by teachers
120 teachers × 2 trees = 240
