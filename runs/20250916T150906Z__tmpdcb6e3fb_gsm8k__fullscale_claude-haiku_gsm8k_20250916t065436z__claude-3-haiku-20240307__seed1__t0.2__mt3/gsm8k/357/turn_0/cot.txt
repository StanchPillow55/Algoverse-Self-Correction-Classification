To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities Morgan wants to do and then determine how many friends she can invite within her $90 budget.

Given information:
- Morgan has a $90 budget for her birthday party.
- She wants to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice.
- A round of mini-golf costs $5.
- The go-karts cost $10 per ride.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the activities.
Cost of mini-golf = $5
Cost of arcade tokens = $5
Cost of go-karts (2 rides) = $10 Ã— 2 = $20
Total cost of activities = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the remaining budget for inviting friends.
Remaining budget = Total budget - Total cost of activities
Remaining budget = $90 - $30 = $60

Step 3: Calculate the cost per friend.
Cost per friend = Total cost of activities / (1 + Number of friends)
Since Morgan is also
