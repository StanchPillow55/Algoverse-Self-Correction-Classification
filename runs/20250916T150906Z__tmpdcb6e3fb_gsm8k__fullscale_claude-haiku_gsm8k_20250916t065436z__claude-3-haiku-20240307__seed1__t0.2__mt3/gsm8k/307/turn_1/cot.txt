Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.
- Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate how much weight Joey loses in a single week.
Joey's weight loss per week = 8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds per week

Step 2: Calculate how much weight Sandy loses in 4 weeks.
Sandy's weight loss in 4 weeks = Joey's weight loss in 1 week
Sandy's weight loss in 4 weeks = 2 pounds

Step 3: Calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey (8 pounds).
Sandy's weight loss per week = Joey's weight loss per week / 4 = 2 pounds / 4 = 0.5 pounds per week
Time for Sandy to lose 8 pounds = 8 pounds / 0.5 pounds per week = 16 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of
