Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours to their vacation spot.
- They drove at an average of 50 miles per hour.
- They hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed.
- It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

Step 1: Calculate the hiking speed.
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 1/2 of driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = (1/2 × 50) - 5 = 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the distance hiked.
Time hiked = 1.5 hours
Distance hiked = Hiking speed × Time hiked
Distance hiked = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance driven.
Total time = 6 hours
Time driven = Total time - Time hiked
Time driven
