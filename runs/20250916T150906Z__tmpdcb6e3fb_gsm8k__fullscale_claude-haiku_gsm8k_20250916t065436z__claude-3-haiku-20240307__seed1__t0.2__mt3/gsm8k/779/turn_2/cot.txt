Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Llesis family drove and hiked for a total of 6 hours to their vacation spot.
- They drove an average of 50 miles per hour.
- They hiked an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their speed when they drive.
- It took them 1.5 hours to hike.

Step 1: Calculate the average speed of the hike.
Driving speed = 50 miles per hour
Hiking speed = 1/2 of driving speed - 5 miles per hour
Hiking speed = (50 / 2) - 5 = 20 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the distance covered during the hike.
Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours
Distance covered during hike = Hiking speed × Time spent hiking
Distance covered during hike = 20 miles per hour × 1.5 hours = 30 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance covered during the drive.
Time spent driving = Total time - Time spent hiking
Time spent driving =
