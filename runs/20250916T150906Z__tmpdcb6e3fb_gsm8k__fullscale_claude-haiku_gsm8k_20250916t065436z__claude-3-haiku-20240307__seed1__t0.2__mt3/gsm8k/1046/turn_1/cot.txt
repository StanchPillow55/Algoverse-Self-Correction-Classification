Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There is a team of 4 painters.
- They worked on a mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks.

To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the following:
1. Total number of days worked
2. Total number of hours worked per day
3. Total number of hours worked by the team
4. Total number of hours worked by each painter

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked.
There are 3 weeks, and each week has 7 days.
Total number of days worked = 3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked per day.
We know that the team worked for 3/8ths of a day every day.
1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of a day = 3/8 × 24 hours = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked by the team.
Total number of
