To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours each painter worked.

Given information:
- The team consists of 4 painters.
- They worked on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks.

Step 1: Convert the fraction of a day to hours.
1 day = 24 hours
3/8 of a day = (3/8) × 24 hours = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days the team worked.
Total number of days = 3 weeks × 7 days per week = 21 days

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours the team worked.
Total number of hours = Number of hours per day × Number of days
Total number of hours = 9 hours × 21 days = 189 hours

Step 4: Calculate the number of hours each painter worked.
Number of hours each painter worked = Total number of hours / Number of painters
Number of hours each painter worked = 189 hours / 4 painters = 47.25 hours

Therefore, each painter put in 47.
