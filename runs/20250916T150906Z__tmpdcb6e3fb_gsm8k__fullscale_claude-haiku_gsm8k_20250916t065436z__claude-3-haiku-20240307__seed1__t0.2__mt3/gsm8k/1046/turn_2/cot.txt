Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The team consists of 4 painters.
2. They worked on the mansion for 3/8ths of a day every day.
3. They worked for 3 weeks.

To find the total hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the following:
* Total number of days worked
* Total number of hours worked per day
* Total number of hours worked over the 3 weeks
* Total number of hours worked per painter

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked.
* There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks = 21 days.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of hours worked per day.
* 1 day = 24 hours
* 3/8 of a day = 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours

Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours worked over the 3 weeks.
* 21 days * 9 hours per day = 189 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total number of hours worked per painter.
