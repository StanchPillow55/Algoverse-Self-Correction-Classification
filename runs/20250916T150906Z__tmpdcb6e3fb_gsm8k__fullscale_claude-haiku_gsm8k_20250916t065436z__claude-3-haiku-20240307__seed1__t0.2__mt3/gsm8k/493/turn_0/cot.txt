To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the razors after the discount and then calculate the cost per individual razor.

Given information:
- Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.
- The razors are currently on sale for buy one get one free.
- Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
- Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the razors before the discount.
Cost of 2 packs of razors = 2 ร $4.00 = $8.00

Step 2: Apply the buy one get one free discount.
Since the discount is buy one get one free, the total cost of the razors is halved.
Total cost of the razors after the discount = $8.00 รท 2 = $4.00

Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon.
Total cost of the razors after the discount and coupon = $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.
