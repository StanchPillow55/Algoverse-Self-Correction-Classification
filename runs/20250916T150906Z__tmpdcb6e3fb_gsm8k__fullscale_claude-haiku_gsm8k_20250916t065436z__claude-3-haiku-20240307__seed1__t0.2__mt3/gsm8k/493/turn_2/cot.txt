Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Heather's razors come 4 to a pack and cost $4.00 a pack.
2. The razors are currently on sale for buy one get one free.
3. Heather also has a $2.00 coupon.
4. Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the 2 packs of razors without any discounts:
* 2 packs x $4.00 per pack = $8.00

Now, with the buy one get one free sale, the effective cost of the 2 packs is:
* $8.00 / 2 = $4.00

Finally, with the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is:
* $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

Now, to find the cost per individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the total number of razors:
* 2 packs x 4 razors per pack = 8
