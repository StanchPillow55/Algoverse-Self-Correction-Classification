To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money Roy has saved based on the given information.

Given information:
- Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.
- Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.
- Eva has saved $20.00.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Anthony has saved.
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

Step 2: Find the amount of money Roy has saved.
Roy's savings = Anthony's savings + 40% of Anthony's savings
Roy's savings = $30.00 + (0.40 Ã— $30.00)
Roy's savings = $30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

Therefore, Roy has $42.00 saved.

Final answer: Roy has $42.00 saved.
