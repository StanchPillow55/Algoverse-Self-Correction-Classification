Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
2. Mark is making a quadruple batch, which means he needs 4 times the normal amount of ingredients.

To calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch:
* Flour needed: 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups
* Milk needed: 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups

Now, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
* 12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so: 
* 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract:
* 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles
