Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. The watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

2. After two months, Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest, so she took them home.
   * To calculate how many watermelons were ready for harvest:
     * 30% of 120 = 0.30 x 120 = 36 watermelons

3. After the first harvest, the remaining watermelons were:
   * 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready, so Ashlyn harvested them.
   * To calculate how many watermelons were ready for the second harvest:
     * 3/4 of 84 = 0.75 x 84 = 63 watermelons

5. The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is:
   * 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons

Therefore, the number of water
