Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The watermelon farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
- After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
- Ashlyn took the 30% of ready watermelons home.
- Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.

Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home after the first two months.
30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 × 120 = 36 watermelons

Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after the first two months.
Remaining watermelons = Total watermelons - Watermelons taken home
Remaining watermelons = 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons

Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home after the two-week period.
3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons = 3/4 × 84 = 63 watermelons
