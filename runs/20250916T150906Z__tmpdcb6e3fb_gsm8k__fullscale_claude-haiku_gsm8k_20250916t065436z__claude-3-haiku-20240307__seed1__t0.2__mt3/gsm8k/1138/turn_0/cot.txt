To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks.

Given information:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings him 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings him 10 chickens per day.
- The duration is three weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cows after three weeks.
Initial number of cows = 50
Number of cows added per day = 20
Number of days in three weeks = 21 (3 weeks × 7 days per week)
Total number of cows added in three weeks = 20 cows per day × 21 days = 420 cows
Total number of cows on the farm after three weeks = Initial number of cows + Total number of cows added
Total number of cows = 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Step 2: Calculate the number of chickens after three weeks.
Initial number of chickens = 20
Number of chickens added per
