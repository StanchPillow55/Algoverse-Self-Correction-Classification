Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial number of animals on the farm:
   - 50 cows
   - 20 chickens
   - Total: 50 + 20 = 70 animals

2. Additions to the farm over 3 weeks:
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day
   - Over 3 weeks (21 days), the total additions are:
     - Cows: 20 cows/day x 21 days = 420 cows
     - Chickens: 10 chickens/day x 21 days = 210 chickens

3. Total number of animals on the farm after 3 weeks:
   - Initial animals: 70
   - Cows added: 420
   - Chickens added: 210
   - Total: 70 + 420 + 210 = 700 animals

Therefore, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.
