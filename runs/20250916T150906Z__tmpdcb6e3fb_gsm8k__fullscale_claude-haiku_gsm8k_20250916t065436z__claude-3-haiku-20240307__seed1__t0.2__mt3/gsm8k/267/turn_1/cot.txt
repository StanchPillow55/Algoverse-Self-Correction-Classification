Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.

2. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
   * 40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 * 20 = 8 minutes
   * So the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes.

3. After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   * Warming the oil took 28 minutes.
   * So the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Now, let's add up the total time:
* Heating the oil to 300 degrees: 20 minutes
* Heating the oil from 300 to 400 degrees: 8 minutes
* Cooking time: 23 minutes
* Total time: 20 + 8 + 23 =
