Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John has 2 houses.
2. Each house has 3 bedrooms.
3. Each bedroom has 2 windows.
4. There are an additional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.

To calculate the total number of windows:

* Bedrooms:
  - Each house has 3 bedrooms
  - Each bedroom has 2 windows
  - So, each house has 3 x 2 = 6 bedroom windows
  - For 2 houses, that's 6 x 2 = 12 bedroom windows

* Additional windows:
  - Each house has 4 additional windows
  - For 2 houses, that's 4 x 2 = 8 additional windows

* Total windows:
  - Bedroom windows: 12
  - Additional windows: 8
  - Total windows = 12 + 8 = 20

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is 20.
