Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John has 2 houses
- Each house has 3 bedrooms
- Each bedroom has 2 windows
- Each house has an additional 4 windows not connected to bedrooms

Step 1: Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for each house.
Number of bedrooms per house = 3
Number of windows per bedroom = 2
Number of windows in bedrooms per house = 3 bedrooms × 2 windows = 6 windows

Step 2: Calculate the total number of windows in each house.
Number of windows in bedrooms per house = 6 windows
Number of additional windows per house = 4 windows
Total number of windows per house = 6 windows + 4 windows = 10 windows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows between the two houses.
Number of houses = 2
Total number of windows between the two houses = 2 houses × 10 windows per house = 20 windows

Therefore, the total number of windows between the two houses is 20 windows.
