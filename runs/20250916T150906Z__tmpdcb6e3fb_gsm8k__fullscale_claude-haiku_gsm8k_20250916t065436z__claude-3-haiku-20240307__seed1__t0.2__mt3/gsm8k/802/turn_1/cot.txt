Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has:
   * 3 stuffed puppies
   * 5 stuffed koalas
   * 2 stuffed zebras
   * 4 stuffed frogs
   * Total = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals

2. Now, we want the percentage of stuffed goats to be 30% of the total. 
   * 30% of 14 = 0.3 * 14 = 4.2 stuffed goats

3. However, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, since we can't have a fraction of a stuffed goat.
   * Therefore, Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.

Final answer: Bubbles should buy 5 stuffed goats.
