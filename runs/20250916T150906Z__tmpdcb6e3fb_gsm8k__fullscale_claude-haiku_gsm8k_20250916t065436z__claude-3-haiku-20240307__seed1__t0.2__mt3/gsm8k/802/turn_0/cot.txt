To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles currently has, and then calculate the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy to make the percentage of stuffed goats 30% of the total.

Given information:
- Bubbles has 3 stuffed puppies, 5 stuffed koalas, 2 stuffed zebras, and 4 stuffed frogs.

Let x be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles needs to buy.
Total number of stuffed animals after buying the goats =
