Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The bag of buttons had a total of 21 buttons.
- 7 buttons had 2 holes each.
- The remaining buttons had 4 holes each.

To find the total number of holes in all the buttons, we need to calculate the number of holes for the 7 buttons with 2 holes each, and the number of holes for the remaining buttons with 4 holes each, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of holes for the 7 buttons with 2 holes each.
Number of holes for 7 buttons with 2 holes each = 7 Ã— 2 = 14 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes each.
Total number of buttons - Number of buttons with 2 holes = Number of buttons with 4 holes
21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes

Step 3: Calculate the number of holes for the 14 buttons with 4 holes each.
Number of holes for 14 buttons with
