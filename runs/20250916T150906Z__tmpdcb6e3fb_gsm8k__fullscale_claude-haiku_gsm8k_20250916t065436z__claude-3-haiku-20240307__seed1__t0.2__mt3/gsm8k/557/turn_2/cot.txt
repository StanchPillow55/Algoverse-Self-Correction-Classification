Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The bag of buttons had 21 buttons in total.
- 7 buttons had 2 holes each.
- The remaining buttons had 4 holes each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes.
Total buttons - Buttons with 2 holes = Buttons with 4 holes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of holes in the buttons with 4 holes.
Buttons with 4 holes × 4 holes per button = Total holes in buttons with 4 holes
14 × 4 = 56 holes

Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes in all the buttons.
Total holes in buttons with 2 holes + Total holes in buttons with
