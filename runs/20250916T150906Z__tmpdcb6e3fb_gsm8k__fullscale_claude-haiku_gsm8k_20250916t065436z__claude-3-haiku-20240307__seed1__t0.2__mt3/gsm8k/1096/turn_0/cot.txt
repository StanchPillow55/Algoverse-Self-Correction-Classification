To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
2. Determine the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days.
3. Calculate the number of days Billy works.
4. Determine the number of people Billy can help per day.
5. Calculate the total number of people Billy helps.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.
Total days = 31 days in March + 19 days in April = 50 days

Step 2: Determine the number of days Billy takes off, which is 20% of the total days.
Number of days off = 20% of 50 days = 0.20 Ã— 50 = 10 days

Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.
Number of days worked = Total days - Days off = 50 days - 10 days = 40 days

Step 4: Determine the number of people Billy can help per day.
Billy can help 2 people per
