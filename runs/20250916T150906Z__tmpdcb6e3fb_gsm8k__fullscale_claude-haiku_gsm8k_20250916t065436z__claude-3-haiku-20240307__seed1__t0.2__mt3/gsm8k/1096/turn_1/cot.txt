Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.
   * That means he can help 2 people x 3 hours = 6 people per day.

2. There are 31 days in March and 19 days in April (until April 19th).
   * That's a total of 31 + 19 = 50 days.

3. Billy takes 20% of the days off.
   * 20% of 50 days = 0.2 x 50 = 10 days off.

4. So, he helps people on the remaining 50 - 10 = 40 days.

5. On each of those 40 days, he helps 6 people.
   * 40 days x 6 people per day = 240 people.

Therefore, the final answer is that Billy helps 240 people.
