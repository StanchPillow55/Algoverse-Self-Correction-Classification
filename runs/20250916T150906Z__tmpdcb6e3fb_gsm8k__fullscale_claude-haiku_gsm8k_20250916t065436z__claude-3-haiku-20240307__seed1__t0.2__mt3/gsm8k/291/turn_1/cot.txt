Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 adults and 8 children.
- There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars.
Total number of chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will get.
Number of chocolate bars for adults = 4 adults × 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Step 3: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children.
Number of chocolate bars remaining for children = Total chocolate bars - Chocolate bars for adults
Number of chocolate bars remaining for children = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get.
Number of chocolate bars per child = Chocolate bars remaining for children / Number of children
Number of chocolate bars per child = 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars
