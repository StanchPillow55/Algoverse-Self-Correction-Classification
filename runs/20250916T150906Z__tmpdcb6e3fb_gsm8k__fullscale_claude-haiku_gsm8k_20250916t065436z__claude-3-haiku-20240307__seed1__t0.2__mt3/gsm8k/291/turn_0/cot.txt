Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 adults and 8 children.
- There are 8 packets of chocolate bars, and each packet contains 5 chocolate bars.
- Each adult gets 6 chocolate bars.
- The remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among the children.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars.
Total number of chocolate bars = 8 packets × 5 chocolate bars per packet = 40 chocolate bars

Step 2: Calculate the number of chocolate bars the adults will get.
Number of chocolate bars for the adults = 4 adults × 6 chocolate bars per adult = 24 chocolate bars

Step 3: Calculate the number of chocolate bars remaining for the children.
Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children = Total number of chocolate bars - Number of chocolate bars for the adults
Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children = 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars

Step 4: Calculate the number of chocolate bars each child will get.
Number of chocolate bars per child = Number of chocolate bars remaining for the children
