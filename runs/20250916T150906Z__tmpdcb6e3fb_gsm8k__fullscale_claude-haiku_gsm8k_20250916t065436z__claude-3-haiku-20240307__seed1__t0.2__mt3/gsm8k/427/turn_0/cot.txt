To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cards Kenny started with.

Given information:
- The amusement park ticket costs $100.
- Kenny sells the cards for $1.5 each.
- Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards and gets $50 in spending cash.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Kenny needs to buy the amusement park ticket and have $50 in spending cash.
Total amount needed = Amusement park ticket cost + Spending cash
Total amount needed = $100 + $50 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Kenny will get from selling the cards.
Total amount from selling cards = (2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5

Step 3: Set up an equation to find the total number of cards.
Total amount from selling cards = Total amount needed
(2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5 = $150

Step 4: Solve the equation for the total number of cards.
(2/3) × Total number of cards × $1.5 = $150
Total number
