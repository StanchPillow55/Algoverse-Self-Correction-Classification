To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of flowers in Arianna's garden and then calculate how many of them have bloomed.

Given information:
- Arianna's garden has 10 rows of flowers.
- Each row has 20 flowers.
- Currently, only 4/5 of the planted flowers have bloomed.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers in Arianna's garden.
Total number of flowers = Number of rows × Number of flowers per row
Total number of flowers = 10 × 20 = 200 flowers

Step 2: Calculate the number of flowers that have bloomed.
Fraction of flowers that have bloomed = 4/5
Number of flowers that have bloomed = Total number of flowers × Fraction of flowers that have bloomed
Number of flowers that have bloomed = 200 × 4/5 = 160 flowers

Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.

Final answer: 160 flowers have bloomed in Arianna's garden.
