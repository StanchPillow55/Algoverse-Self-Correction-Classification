Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each tray can hold 24 eggs.
- Jaime has 64 eggs.
- Jaime has 2 trays.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs that can be placed on the 2 trays.
Total capacity of the 2 trays = 2 Ã— 24 = 48 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs that won't be able to be placed on the trays.
Number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays = Total eggs - Total capacity of the trays
Number of eggs that won't be placed on the trays = 64 - 48 = 16 eggs

Therefore, 16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays.

Final answer: 16 eggs won't be able to be placed on the trays.
