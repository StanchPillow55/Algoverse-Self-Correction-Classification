To solve this problem, we need to find the share of the first person.

Given information:
- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the share of the first person be x.
- The share of the second person is x + $80.
- The share of the third person is 2(x + $80).

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total amount.
Total amount = Share of the first person + Share of the second person + Share of the third person
$1920 = x + (x + $80) + 2(x + $80)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
$1920 = x + x + $80 + 2x + 2($80)
$1920 = 4x + $240

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
$1920 = 4x + $240
$1680 = 4x
x = $420

Therefore, the share
