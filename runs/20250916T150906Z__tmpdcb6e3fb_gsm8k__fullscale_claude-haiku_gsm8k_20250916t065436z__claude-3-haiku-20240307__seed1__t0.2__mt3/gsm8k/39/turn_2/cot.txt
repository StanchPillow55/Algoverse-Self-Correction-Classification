Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
- Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
- The total time is 6 hours.

Step 1: Find Dana's running speed.
Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour, and her skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, we can calculate her running speed as follows:
Running speed = 2 × Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 × 3 miles per hour = 6 miles per hour

Step 2: Find Dana's walking speed.
We know that Dana's running speed is four times faster than her walking speed, so we can calculate her walking speed as follows:
Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour

Step 3:
