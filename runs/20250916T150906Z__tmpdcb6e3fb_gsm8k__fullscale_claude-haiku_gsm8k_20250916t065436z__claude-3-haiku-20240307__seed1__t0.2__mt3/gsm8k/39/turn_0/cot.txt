To solve this problem, we need to find the rates of walking and running, and then calculate the distance traveled during the given time.

Given information:
- Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk.
- Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run.
- Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.
- Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
- The total time is 6 hours.

Step 1: Find the rate of skipping.
Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour.

Step 2: Find the rate of running.
Since Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, we can use the following equation:
Rate of skipping = 1/2 × Rate of running
3 miles per hour = 1/2 × Rate of running
Rate of running = 3 × 2 = 6 miles per hour

Step 3: Find the rate of walking.
Since Dana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we
