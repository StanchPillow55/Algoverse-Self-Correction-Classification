Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays.
- The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays.
- The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Fridays compared to Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chimichangas made on Fridays.
Chimichangas made on Fridays = 2 × Chimichangas made on Tuesdays and Wednesdays
Chimichangas made on Fridays = 2 × 125 = 250 chimichangas

Step 2: Calculate the total number of chimichangas made on the three days.
Total chimichangas made = Chimichangas made on Tuesdays + Chimichangas made on Wednesdays + Chimichangas made on Fridays
Total chimichangas made = 125
