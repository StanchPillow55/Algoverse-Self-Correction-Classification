To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount Gus spent at the grocery store and then subtract it from the given total of $20.00 to find the cost of the apple pie.

Given information:
- Gus spent $20.00 at the grocery store.
- He bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each.
- He bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.
- He bought a bottle of soda for $1.00.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought.
Cost of 2 bags of chips = 2 Ã— $2.00 = $4.00
Cost of the bucket of fried chicken = $8.00
Cost of the bottle of soda = $1.00
Total cost of the items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the apple pie.
Total amount spent at the grocery store = $20.00
Total cost of the items = $13.00
Cost of the apple pie = Total amount spent
