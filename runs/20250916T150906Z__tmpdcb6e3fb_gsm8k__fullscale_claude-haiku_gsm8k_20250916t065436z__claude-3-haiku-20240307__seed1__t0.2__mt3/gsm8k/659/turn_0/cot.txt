Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 pound of almonds costs $10
- 1 pound of walnuts costs $15

Mixture 1:
- 1/2 pound of almonds
- 1/3 pound of walnuts

Mixture 2:
- 1/5 pound of almonds
- 1/3 pound of walnuts

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Mixture 1.
Cost of 1/2 pound of almonds = (1/2) × $10 = $5
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = (1/3) × $15 = $5
Total cost of Mixture 1 = $5 + $5 = $10

Step 2: Calculate the cost of Mixture 2.
Cost of 1/5 pound of almonds = (1/5) × $10 = $2
Cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts = (1/3) × $15 = $5
Total cost of
