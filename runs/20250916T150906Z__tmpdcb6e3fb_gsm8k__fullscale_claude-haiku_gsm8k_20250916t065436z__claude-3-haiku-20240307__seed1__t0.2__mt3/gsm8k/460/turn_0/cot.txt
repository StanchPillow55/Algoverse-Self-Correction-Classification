Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- An aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
- A plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
- Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda and 5 plastic bottles of water per week.
- We need to find the total amount of cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the aluminum cans Grayson recycles per week.
Value of aluminum cans per week = 3 cans × 2 cents per can = 6 cents

Step 2: Calculate the value of the plastic bottles Grayson recycles per week.
Value of plastic bottles per week = 5 bottles × 3 cents per bottle = 15 cents

Step 3: Calculate the total value of Grayson's recycling per week.
Total value per week = Value of aluminum cans + Value of plastic bottles
Total value per week = 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents

Step 4: Calculate the total value of
