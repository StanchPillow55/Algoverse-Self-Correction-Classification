Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces.
Length of the fabric pieces = 6 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet
Width of the fabric pieces = 8 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 12 feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of each fabric piece.
Area of each fabric piece = Length × Width
Area of each fabric piece = 10 feet × 12 feet = 120 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric needed.
Total area of fabric needed = Area of 2 fabric pieces
Total area of fabric needed = 2 × 120 square feet = 240 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 240 square feet of fabric to make the comforter for his king-sized bed.
