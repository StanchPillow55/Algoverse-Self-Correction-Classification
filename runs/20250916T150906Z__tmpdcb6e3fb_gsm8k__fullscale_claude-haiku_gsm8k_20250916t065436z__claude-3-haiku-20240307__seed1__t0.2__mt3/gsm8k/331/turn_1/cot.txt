To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net pay for each job and then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- Job A:
  - Hourly rate: $15
  - Hours per year: 2000
  - Total tax rate: 20%
- Job B:
  - Annual salary: $42,000
  - Property tax: $6,000
  - Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%

Step 1: Calculate the gross pay for each job.
Gross pay for Job A = $15 Ã— 2000 hours = $30,000
Gross pay for Job B = $42,000

Step 2: Calculate the net pay for each job.
Net pay for Job A:
Taxes for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Net pay for Job B:
Net income before property tax = $42,000
Property tax = $6,000
Net income after property tax = $42,000 - $6,
