To solve this problem, we need to calculate the net pay for each job and then find the difference between the two.

Given information:
- Job A: $15 per hour, 2000 hours per year, 20% total tax rate
- Job B: $42,000 per year, $6,000 property tax, 10% tax rate on net income after property tax

Step 1: Calculate the gross pay for each job.
Gross pay for Job A = $15 per hour Ã— 2000 hours per year = $30,000 per year
Gross pay for Job B = $42,000 per year

Step 2: Calculate the net pay for each job.
Net pay for Job A:
Tax for Job A = 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay for Job A = $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Net pay for Job B:
Property tax = $6,000
Taxable income = $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax for Job B = 10% of $36,000
