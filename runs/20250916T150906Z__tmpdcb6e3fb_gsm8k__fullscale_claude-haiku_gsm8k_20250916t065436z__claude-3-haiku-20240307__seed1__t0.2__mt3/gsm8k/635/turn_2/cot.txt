Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum cost per class that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum cost per class = $10

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the 10 classes.
Total cost of 10 classes = $60

Step 3: Calculate the maximum total cost that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum total cost = Maximum cost per class × Number of classes
Maximum total cost = $10 × 10 = $100

Step 4: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before his parents won't sign him up again.
Since the total cost of the 10 classes is $60, and the maximum total cost that Manny's parents will allow is $100, the difference is $40.
Number of classes Manny can miss = Difference in total cost / Maximum cost per class
Number of classes
