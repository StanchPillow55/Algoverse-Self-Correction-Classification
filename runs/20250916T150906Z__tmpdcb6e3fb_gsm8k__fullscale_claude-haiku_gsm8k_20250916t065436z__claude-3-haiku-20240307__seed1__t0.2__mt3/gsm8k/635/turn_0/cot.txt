To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class is more than $10.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the cost per class.
Cost per class = Total cost / Total number of classes
Cost per class = $60 / 10 = $6 per class

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of classes Manny can miss.
Since the cost per class is $6, and the maximum cost per class is $10, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10.

Explanation:
If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class is $6.
If Manny misses 1 class, the cost per class would be $60 / 9 = $6.67, which is still less than $10.
If Manny misses 2 classes,
