Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Manny signed up for Karate classes for $60.
- His parents won't sign him up again if the classes cost more than $10 per class.
- There are 10 total classes.

Step 1: Calculate the maximum total cost of the classes that Manny's parents will allow.
Maximum total cost = $10 per class × 10 classes = $100

Step 2: Calculate the cost per class that Manny's parents will allow.
Cost per class = $100 / 10 classes = $10 per class

Step 3: Calculate the number of classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.
If Manny misses x classes, the total cost will be $60 for the remaining (10 - x) classes.
Total cost = $60
Cost per class = $60 / (10 - x)

We know the cost per class must be less than or equal to $10, so:
$60 / (10 - x) ≤ $10
