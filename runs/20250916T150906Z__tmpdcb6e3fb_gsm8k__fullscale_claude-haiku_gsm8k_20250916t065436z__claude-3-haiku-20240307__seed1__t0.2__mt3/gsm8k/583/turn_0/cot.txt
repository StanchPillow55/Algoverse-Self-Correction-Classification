Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Judy bought a dozen cups (12 cups)
- Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups
- Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy

Step 1: Calculate the number of dishes Judy bought.
Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, so:
Number of dishes = 2 × Number of cups
Number of dishes = 2 × 12 = 24 dishes

Step 2: Calculate the number of dishes Judy's friend brought.
Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, so:
Number of dishes Judy's friend brought = 24 + 20 = 44 dishes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of utensils brought by the two.
Total number of utensils = Number of cups Judy brought + Number of dishes Judy brought + Number of cups Judy's friend brought + Number of dishes Judy's friend brought
Total number of utensils = 12 + 24 + 40 + 44 = 120
