Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.
- Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.

Step 1: Convert Xavier's height to inches.
Xavier's initial height = 4 feet
1 foot = 12 inches
Xavier's initial height in inches = 4 feet Ã— 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate Xavier's final height.
Xavier's final height = Xavier's initial height + Growth
Xavier's final height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Step 3: Calculate Cole's final height.
Cole's initial height = 50 inches
Cole's final height = Cole's initial height + Growth
Cole's final height = 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches

Step 4: Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's final heights.
Difference in height = Cole's final height - Xavier's final height
Difference in height = 52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch

Therefore, the difference
