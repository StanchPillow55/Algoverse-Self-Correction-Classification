Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- There are 6 periods in a normal day for a student.
- John has to take 2 extra classes.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He goes to class for 5 days a week.
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per day.
Number of periods per day = 6 + 2 = 8 periods
Duration of each period = 40 minutes
Total minutes per day = 8 periods × 40 minutes = 320 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
Total minutes per week = Total minutes per day × 5 days = 320 minutes × 5 days = 1,600 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
Total minutes per week = 1,600 minutes
Extra learning time
