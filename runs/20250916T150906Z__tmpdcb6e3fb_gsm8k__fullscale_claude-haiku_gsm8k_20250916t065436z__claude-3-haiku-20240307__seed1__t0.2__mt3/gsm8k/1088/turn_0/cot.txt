To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
2. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
3. Add the total minutes spent in class and on extra learning time to get the total minutes spent learning per week.
4. Convert the total minutes spent learning per week to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
* John has 8 classes per day (6 normal classes + 2 extra classes)
* Each class is 40 minutes long
* He goes to class for 5 days a week
* Total minutes in class per week = 8 classes × 40 minutes × 5 days = 1,600 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
* John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday
* Total minutes per week = 1,600 minutes
* Minutes spent on extra learning time = 1,600 minutes
