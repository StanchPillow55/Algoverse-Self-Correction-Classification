Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
- She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
- She bakes muffins for her friends every day using 4 eggs.
- She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day.
Total eggs laid per day = 16

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs used for breakfast and muffins.
Eggs used for breakfast = 3
Eggs used for muffins = 4
Total eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7

Step 3: Calculate the number of eggs remaining to be sold at the farmers' market.
Eggs remaining to be sold = Total eggs laid - Eggs used for breakfast and muffins
Eggs remaining to be sold = 16 - 7 = 9

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of money Janet makes at the farmers' market.
Money made at the farmers' market = Eggs remaining to be sold Ã— Price
