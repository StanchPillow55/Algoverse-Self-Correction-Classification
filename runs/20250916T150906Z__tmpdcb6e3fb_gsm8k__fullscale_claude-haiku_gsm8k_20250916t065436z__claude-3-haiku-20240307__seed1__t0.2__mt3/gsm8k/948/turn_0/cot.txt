To solve this problem, we need to calculate the commission Cayley will earn from the sales of the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and then add them together to find the total commission.

Given information:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- The cost of each copy of the New York Times is $5.
- The cost of each copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15.
