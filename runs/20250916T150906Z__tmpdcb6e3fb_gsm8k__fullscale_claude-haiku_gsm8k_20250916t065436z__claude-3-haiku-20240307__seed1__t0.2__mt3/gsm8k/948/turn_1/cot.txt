Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times.
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal.
- The cost of each New York Times copy is $5.
- The cost of each Wall Street Journal copy is $15.
