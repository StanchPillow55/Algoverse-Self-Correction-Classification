Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times
- Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal
- The New York Times costs $5 per copy
- The Wall Street Journal costs $15 per copy
- Cayley sold 6 copies of the New York Times
- Cayley sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal

Step 1: Calculate the commission on the New York Times sales.
Commission on New York Times = 10% of $5 per copy
Commission per copy = 0.10 × $5 = $0.50
Total commission on 6 copies = 6 × $0.50 = $3.00

Step 2: Calculate the commission on the Wall Street Journal sales.
Commission on Wall Street Journal = 8% of $15 per copy
Commission per copy = 0.08 × $15 = $1.20
Total commission on 10 copies = 10 × $1.20 = $12.00
