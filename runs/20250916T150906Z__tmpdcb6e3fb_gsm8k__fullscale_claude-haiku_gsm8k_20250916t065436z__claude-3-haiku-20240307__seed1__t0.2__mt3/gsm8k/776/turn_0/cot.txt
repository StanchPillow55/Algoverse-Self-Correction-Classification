Certainly! Let's solve this step-by-step.

Given information:
- The original price of the laptop is $1000.
- There is a 20% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 20%
Discount amount = Original price × Discount percentage
Discount amount = $1000 × 0.20 = $200

Step 2: Calculate the final price after the discount.
Final price = Original price - Discount amount
Final price = $1000 - $200 = $800

Therefore, the amount you have to pay for the laptop after the 20% discount is $800.
