To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people going on the tour, which includes the employees and the tour guides.

Given information:
- The company has 3 groups of 200 employees each.
- Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees going on the tour.
Total number of employees = 3 groups × 200 employees per group = 600 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total number of tour guides going on the tour.
Total number of tour guides = 3 groups × 7 tour guides per group = 21 tour guides

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people going on the tour.
Total number of people = Total number of employees + Total number of tour guides
Total number of people = 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people

Therefore, the total number of people going on the tour is 621.

Final answer: The total number of people going on the tour is 621.
