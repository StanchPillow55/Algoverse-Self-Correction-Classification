Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Calculate how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.
Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the Comet.
Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the Comet.
Therefore, Bill saw the Comet a second time when his dad was 3 Ã— 30 = 90 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the time between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing the Comet a second time.
Time between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing the Comet a second time = 90 years - 30 years = 60 years

Step 3: Calculate how
