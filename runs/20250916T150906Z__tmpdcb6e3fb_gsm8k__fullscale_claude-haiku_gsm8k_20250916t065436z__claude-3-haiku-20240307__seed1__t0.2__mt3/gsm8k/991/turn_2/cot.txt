Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate how many years it took for Bill's dad to see the Comet again.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years it took for Bill's dad to see the Comet again:
75 years - (30 years) = 45 years

Step 2: Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
We know that Bill saw the Comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, so:
Bill
