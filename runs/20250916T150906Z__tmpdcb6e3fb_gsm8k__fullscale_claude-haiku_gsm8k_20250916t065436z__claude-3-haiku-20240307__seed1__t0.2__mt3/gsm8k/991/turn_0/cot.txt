To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad would have seen the Comet again 75 years after his first sighting.
Age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the second time = 30 + 75 = 105 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time =
