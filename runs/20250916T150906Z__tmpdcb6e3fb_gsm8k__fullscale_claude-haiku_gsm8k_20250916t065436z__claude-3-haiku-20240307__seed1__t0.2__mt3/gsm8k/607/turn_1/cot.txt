Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash, and this will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
Since the directions say 2 pumps per wash and the bottle lasts for 120 washings, the total number of pumps in the bottle is:
2 pumps per wash Ã— 120 washings = 240 pumps

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pump.
Cost per pump = Total cost of the bottle / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps
Cost per pump = $0.10 or 10 cents

Therefore, the cost per pump, in cents, is 10 cents.
