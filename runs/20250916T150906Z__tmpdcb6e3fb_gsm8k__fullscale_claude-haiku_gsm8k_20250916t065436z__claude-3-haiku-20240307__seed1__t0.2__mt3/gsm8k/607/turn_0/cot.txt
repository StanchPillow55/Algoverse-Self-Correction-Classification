Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash, and this will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

To find the cost per pump, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
Since the directions say to use 2 pumps per wash and the bottle lasts for 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
Total number of pumps = 2 pumps per wash Ã— 120 washings = 240 pumps

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pump.
Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the number of pumps she will use is the same as the number of washings, which is 120 pumps.
Cost per pump = Total cost of the jumbo bottle / Total number of
