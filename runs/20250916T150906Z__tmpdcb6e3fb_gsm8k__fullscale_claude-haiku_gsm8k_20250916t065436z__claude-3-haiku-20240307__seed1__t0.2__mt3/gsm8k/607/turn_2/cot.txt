Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash, and this will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
Since the directions say 2 pumps per wash and the bottle gives 120 washings, we can calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:
Total pumps = 2 pumps per wash × 120 washings = 240 pumps

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pump.
Cost per pump = Total cost of the bottle / Total number of pumps
Cost per pump = $24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10 per pump

Step 3: Convert the cost per pump to cents.
Cost per pump in cents = $0.10 per pump × 100 cents/dollar = 10 cents per pump

Therefore, if Jackie uses 1 pump per wash
