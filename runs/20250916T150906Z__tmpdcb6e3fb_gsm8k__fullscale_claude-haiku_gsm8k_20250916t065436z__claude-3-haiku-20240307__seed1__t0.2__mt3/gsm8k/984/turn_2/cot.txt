Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the flower bed.
Total width of the flower bed = 111 feet

Step 2: Calculate the space needed for each plant.
Space needed for each plant = 1 foot (width of the plant) + 1.5 feet (space between plants)
Total space needed for each plant = 2.5 feet

Step 3: Calculate the number of plants needed to fill the flower bed.
Number of plants needed = Total width of the flower bed / Space needed for each plant
Number of plants needed = 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4 plants

Since we can't have a fractional plant, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of plants needed = 45
