Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the total length of the flower bed that needs to be filled.
Total length of flower bed = 111 feet
Length taken by the 17 flowers Pat already owns = 17 feet (17 flowers x 1 foot per flower)
Remaining length to be filled = 111 feet - 17 feet = 94 feet

Step 2: Calculate the number of additional plants needed to fill the remaining length.
Space needed between each plant = 1.5 feet
Number of additional plants needed = Remaining length / (1 foot + 1.5 feet) = 94 feet / 2.5 feet = 37.6 plants
Since we can't have a fractional plant, we round up to 38
