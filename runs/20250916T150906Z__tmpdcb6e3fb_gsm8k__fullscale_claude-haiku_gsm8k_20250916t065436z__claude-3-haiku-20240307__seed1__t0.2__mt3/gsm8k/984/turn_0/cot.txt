To solve this problem, we need to find the number of plants required to fill the flower bed, and then calculate the total cost of the additional plants needed.

Given information:
- The flower bed is 111 feet long.
- Each flower grows 12 inches wide (1 foot).
- Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet between every plant.
- Pat already owns 17 flowers.
- Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.

Step 1: Calculate the available space in the flower bed.
Total length of the flower bed = 111 feet
Space required between each plant = 1.5 feet
Available space for the plants = Total length - (Number of plants × Space between each plant)

Step 2: Calculate the number of plants that can fit in the available space.
Available space = 111 feet - (Number of plants × 1.5 feet)
Number of plants = Available space / 1.5 feet

Step 3: Determine the number of additional plants needed.
Total number of plants required = Available space / 1.5 feet
Number of additional plants needed = Total number of plants require
