Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
- Bob went to the pet store and had the sales assistant dip out 17 fish from a mixed tank of white and orange fish.
- After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 1: Determine the total number of fish Bob has in his pond after adding the new fish.
Initial number of fish + New fish = Total number of fish
7 + 17 = 24 fish

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the number of orange and white fish.
Let x = number of white fish bought at the store
Then, the number of orange fish bought at the store is 17 - x

We know that after adding the new fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.
Number of orange fish = 2 Ã— Number of white fish
(3 + 17 - x) = 2x

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
