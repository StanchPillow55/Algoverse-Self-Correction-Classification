Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
- Bob went to the pet store and had the sales assistant dip out 17 more fish.
- After adding the new fish to his pond, Bob now has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

Step 1: Determine the total number of fish Bob has in his pond after adding the new fish.
Initial number of fish + New fish = Total number of fish
7 + 17 = 24 fish

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between the orange and white fish.
Let x = number of white fish Bob bought at the store
Then, 2x = number of orange fish Bob bought at the store

Step 3: Write an equation to represent the total number of fish.
Total number of fish = Initial orange fish + New orange fish + Initial white fish + New white fish
24 = 3 + 2x + 4 + x
24 = 3 + 2x + 4 + x
24
