Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs.
- An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs.
- Each pepper costs $15.
- Dillon needs to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.

Step 1: Find the cost of a watermelon.
Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon:
Cost of a watermelon = 3 × $15 = $45

Step 2: Find the cost of an orange.
An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so:
Cost of an orange = $45 - $5 = $40

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the items.
Total cost = (4 watermelons × $45) + (20 peppers × $15) + (10 oranges × $40)
Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400
