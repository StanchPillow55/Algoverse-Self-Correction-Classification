Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Herb's house cost $76,000.
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Juan's house.
Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we can calculate the cost of Juan's house as follows:
Cost of Juan's house = Cost of Herb's house - (Cost of Herb's house × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - ($76,000 × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800
Cost of Juan's house = $53,200

Step 2: Calculate the combined value of the two houses.
Combined value of the two houses = Cost of Herb's house + Cost of Juan's house
Combined value of the two houses = $76,000 + $53,200
Combined value of the two houses = $129,200

Therefore, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.
