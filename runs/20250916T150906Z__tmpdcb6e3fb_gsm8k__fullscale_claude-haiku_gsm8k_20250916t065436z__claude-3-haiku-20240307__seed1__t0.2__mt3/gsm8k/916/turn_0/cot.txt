To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine had, and then divide it by 2 to find the amount their mother gave to each of them.

Given information:
- Julia and Nadine bought a cake for $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons.
Cost of 1 dozen balloons = (1 dozen / 2) × $0.5 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the items they bought.
Total cost = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total cost = $11 + $3 + (2 × $7) = $28

Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after buying the items.
Remaining money = Total allowance - Total cost
Remaining money = Total allowance - $28

Step 4: Find the total allowance that Julia and Nadine had.
