Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother.
- They combined their allowance to buy a cake for $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- The remaining money was used to buy 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons.
1 dozen balloons = 12 balloons
Cost of 2 balloons = $0.5
Cost of 12 balloons = (12 / 2) × $0.5 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ice cream.
2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $7 = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of cake + Cost of balloons + Cost of ice cream
Total amount spent = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

Step 4: Calculate the remaining money
