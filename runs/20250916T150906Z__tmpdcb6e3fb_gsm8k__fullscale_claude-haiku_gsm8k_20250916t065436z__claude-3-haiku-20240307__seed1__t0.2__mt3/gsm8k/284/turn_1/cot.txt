Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stories written in the second week.
Alani's stories in the second week = 20 × 2 = 40 stories
Braylen's stories in the second week = 40 × 2 = 80 stories
Margot's stories in the second week = 60 × 2 = 120 stories

Step 2: Calculate the total number of stories written in both weeks.
Total stories written by Alani = 20 + 40 = 60 stories
Total stories written by Braylen = 40 + 80 = 120 stories
Total stories written by Margot = 60 + 120 = 180 stories

Step 3: Calculate the total number
