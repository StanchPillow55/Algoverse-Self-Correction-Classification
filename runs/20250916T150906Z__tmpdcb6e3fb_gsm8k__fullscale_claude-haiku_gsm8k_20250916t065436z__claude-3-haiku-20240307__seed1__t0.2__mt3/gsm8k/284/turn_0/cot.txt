Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.
- Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.
- Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.
- Each of them doubled the number of stories they wrote in the second week.

Braylen: 40 stories
Margot: 60 stories
Total stories in the first week = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

Total stories written in the second week:
