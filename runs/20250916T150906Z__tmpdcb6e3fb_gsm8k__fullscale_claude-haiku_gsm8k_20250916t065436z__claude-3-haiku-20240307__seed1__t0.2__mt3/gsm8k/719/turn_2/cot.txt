Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice.
- She gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- She gave 4 sacks to her brother.
- There are 25 kilograms of rice per sack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sacks of rice Goldy gave away.
Sacks given to cousin = 3
Sacks given to brother = 4
Total sacks given away = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks

Step 2: Calculate the total kilograms of rice given away.
Kilograms of rice per sack = 25 kg
Total kilograms of rice given away = 7 sacks Ã— 25 kg/sack = 175 kg

Therefore, Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

Final answer: Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.
