Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice.
- She gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- She gave 4 sacks to her brother.
- Each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rice Goldy bought.
Total rice bought = 20 sacks × 25 kilograms per sack = 500 kilograms

Step 2: Calculate the amount of rice Goldy gave to her cousin.
Rice given to cousin = 3 sacks × 25 kilograms per sack = 75 kilograms

Step 3: Calculate the amount of rice Goldy gave to her brother.
Rice given to brother = 4 sacks × 25 kilograms per sack = 100 kilograms

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother.
Total rice given = Rice given to cousin + Rice given to brother
Total rice given = 75 kilograms + 100
