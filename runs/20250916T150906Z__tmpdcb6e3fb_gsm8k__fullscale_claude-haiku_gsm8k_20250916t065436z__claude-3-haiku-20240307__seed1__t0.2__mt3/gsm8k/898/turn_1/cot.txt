Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day.
- Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.
Dijana rowed 50 miles.
Anis rowed = Dijana's distance + 1/5 of Dijana's distance
Anis rowed = 50 miles + (1/5 Ã— 50 miles)
Anis rowed = 50 miles + 10 miles
Anis rowed = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed.
Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
Total distance = 50 miles + 60 miles
Total distance = 110 miles

Therefore, the total distance the two of them rowed on that day was 110 miles.
