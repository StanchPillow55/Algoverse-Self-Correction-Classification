To solve this problem, we need to find the total time each person can play and then calculate the total amount of money used.

Given information:
- Jack can play a game with 1 quarter for 20 minutes.
- Two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack.
- One of his friends can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack.
- They play for 4 hours (240 minutes).

Step 1: Calculate the time each person can play.
Jack's playing time = 20 minutes per quarter
Two friends' playing time = 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes per quarter
One friend's playing time = 20 minutes Ã— 1.5 = 30 minutes per quarter

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used by each person.
Jack's quarters used = 240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter = 12 quarters
Two friends' quarters used = 240 minutes / 10 minutes per quarter = 24 quarters each
One friend's quarters used = 240 minutes / 30 minutes per quarter = 8 quarters
