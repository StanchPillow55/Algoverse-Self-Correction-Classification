Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jack and his 3 friends play at the arcade for 4 hours.
- Jack can play a game for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- Two of his friends can only play half as long as Jack.
- One of his friends can play 1.5 times as long as Jack.

Step 1: Calculate how long each person can play with 1 quarter.
- Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
- Two of his friends can play for 10 minutes (half of 20 minutes) with 1 quarter.
- One of his friends can play for 30 minutes (1.5 times 20 minutes) with 1 quarter.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used.
- Jack can play for 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.
- With 1 quarter per 20 minutes, Jack will use 12 quarters (240 minutes / 20 minutes per quarter).
- The two friends who can play for 10 minutes
