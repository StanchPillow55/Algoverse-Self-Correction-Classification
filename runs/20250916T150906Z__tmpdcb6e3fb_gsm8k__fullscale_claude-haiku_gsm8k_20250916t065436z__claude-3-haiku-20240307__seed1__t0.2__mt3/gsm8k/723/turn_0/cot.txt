Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The restaurant has 170 normal chairs and 23 chairs for babies.
- 20 of the normal chairs and 13 of the baby chairs were sent to the carpenter for repair.

Step 1: Calculate the number of normal chairs left.
Total normal chairs - Chairs sent for repair = Normal chairs left
170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left

Step 2: Calculate the number of baby chairs left.
Total baby chairs - Chairs sent for repair = Baby chairs left
23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left

Step 3: Calculate the total number of chairs left.
Normal chairs left + Baby chairs left = Total chairs left
150 + 10 = 160 chairs left

Therefore, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.

Final answer: The restaurant has 160 chairs left.
