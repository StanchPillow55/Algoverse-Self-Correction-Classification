Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.
- The jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of blue jelly beans.
- Then the number of red jelly beans = x - 1% of x = 0.99x
- And the number of green jelly beans = x + 1% of x = 1.01x

We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up an equation:
0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500

Simplifying the equation:
3x = 4500
x = 1500

Now we can calculate the number of each color of jelly beans:
- Red jelly beans = 0.99 Ã— 1500 =
