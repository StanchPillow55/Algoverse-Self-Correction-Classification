To solve this problem, we need to find the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

Given information:
- Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.
- Jewel processes 50 customers daily.
- They work all days of the week.

Step 1: Find the number of customers Julie processes daily.
Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, she can process twice the number of customers that Jewel can.
Julie's daily production = 2 × Jewel's daily production
Julie's daily production = 2 × 50 = 100 customers

Step 2: Find the total weekly production for Jewel.

Jewel's weekly production = 50 customers × 7 days = 350 customers

Step 3: Find the total weekly production for Julie.
Julie's weekly production = Julie's daily production × Number of days in a week
Julie's weekly production = 100 customers × 7 days = 700 customers

Step 4: Find the total
