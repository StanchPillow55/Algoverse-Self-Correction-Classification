To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of oats required to feed the horses for five days and then calculate the number of bags needed.

Given information:
- Uncle Ben has 4 horses.
- Each horse can consume 5 pounds of oats per meal.
- The horses are fed twice a day.
- One bag contains 50 pounds of oats.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats required per day.
Amount of oats per horse per meal = 5 pounds
Number of meals per day = 2
Total amount of oats per horse per day = 5 pounds × 2 meals = 10 pounds
Total amount of oats required for all 4 horses per day = 10 pounds × 4 horses = 40 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats required for five days.
Total amount of oats required for five days = 40 pounds × 5 days = 200 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of oats needed.
Number of bags of oats needed = Total amount of oats required / Amount of oats
