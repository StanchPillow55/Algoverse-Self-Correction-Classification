Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Uncle Ben has 4 horses
- Each horse can consume 5 pounds of oats per meal
- He feeds his horses twice a day
- One bag contains 50 pounds of oats
- We need to find how many bags of oats he needs for 5 days

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses per day.
Oats consumed per horse per meal = 5 pounds
Oats consumed per horse per day = 5 pounds x 2 meals = 10 pounds
Total oats consumed by 4 horses per day = 10 pounds x 4 horses = 40 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of oats consumed by the horses for 5 days.
Total oats consumed for 5 days = 40 pounds x 5 days = 200 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the number of bags of oats needed.
Number of bags of oats needed = Total oats consumed / Oats per bag
Number of bags of oats needed =
