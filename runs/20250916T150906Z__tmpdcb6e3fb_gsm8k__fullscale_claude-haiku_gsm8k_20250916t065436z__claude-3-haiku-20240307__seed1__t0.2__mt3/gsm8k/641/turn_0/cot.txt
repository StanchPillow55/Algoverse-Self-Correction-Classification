Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month.
- He gets a 5% raise on his salary.
- He also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary.

Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise.
New monthly salary = Current monthly salary + (Current monthly salary × Raise percentage)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + ($20,000 × 0.05)
New monthly salary = $20,000 + $1,000
New monthly salary = $21,000

Step 2: Calculate the bonus amount.
Bonus = Half a month's salary
Bonus = $21,000 ÷ 2
Bonus = $10,500

Step 3: Calculate the total annual income.
Annual income = (New monthly salary × 12 months) + Bonus
Annual income = ($21,000 × 12) + $10,500
Annual income = $252,000 + $10,500
Annual income = $262,500

Therefore, the
