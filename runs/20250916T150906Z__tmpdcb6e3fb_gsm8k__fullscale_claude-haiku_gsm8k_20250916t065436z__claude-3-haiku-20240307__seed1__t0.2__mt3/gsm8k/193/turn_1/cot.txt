Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.

2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the 18 flamingos, which is 6 flamingos.
   * 18 flamingos / 3 = 6 flamingos

3. The neighbors then painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on Sue's front yard.

4. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   * So now there are 18 + 18 = 36 pink flamingos

5. At noon on Sunday, the total number of flamingos in Sue's front yard is:
   * 36 pink flamingos
   * 6 white flamingos

6. To find how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:
   * 36 pink flamingos - 6 white flam
