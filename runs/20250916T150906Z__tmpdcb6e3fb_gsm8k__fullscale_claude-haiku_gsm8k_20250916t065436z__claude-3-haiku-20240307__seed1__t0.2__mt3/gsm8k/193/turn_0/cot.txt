Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Friday, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.
- On Saturday, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back out.
- On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.

Step 1: Calculate the number of flamingos taken back and painted white on Saturday.
One third of 18 flamingos = 18 รท 3 = 6 flamingos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flamingos in the yard on Sunday.
Friday: 18 pink flamingos
Saturday: 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos, plus 6 white flamingos
Sunday: 18 additional pink flamingos
Total flamingos = 12 + 6 + 18 = 36 flamingos

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of pink and white flamingos.
Number of pink flamingos = 12
