Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's front yard.

2. On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the 18 flamingos, which is 6 flamingos. They painted these 6 flamingos white and put them back out on the lawn.
   * 18 - (1/3 * 18) = 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos remaining

3. On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection.
   * 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos

4. At noon on Sunday, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.
   * The difference between the pink and white flamingos is 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.

Therefore, the final answer is:
At noon on Sunday, there were 24 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos
