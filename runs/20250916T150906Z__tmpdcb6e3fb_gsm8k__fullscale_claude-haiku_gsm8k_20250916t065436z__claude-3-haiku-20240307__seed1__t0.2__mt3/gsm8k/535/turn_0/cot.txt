Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Nick had twice as many candies as George.
- George then ate 5 candies.
- George now has 3 candies left.

Step 1: Find out how many candies George had initially.
George has 3 candies left, and he ate 5 candies.
So, George had 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially.

Step 2: Find out how many candies Nick had initially.
Nick had twice as many candies as George, so:
Nick's initial candies = 2 × George's initial candies
Nick's initial candies = 2 × 8 = 16 candies

Therefore, Nick had 16 candies initially.

Final answer:
Nick has 16 candies.
