Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen.
- Jenny bought 15 roses.
- Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills (total of $25).
- The florist only has quarters for change.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 15 roses.
Cost of 15 roses = 15 × $2 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Jenny paid.
Jenny paid with five 5-dollar bills = 5 × $5 = $25

Step 3: Calculate the amount of change Jenny should receive.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost of roses
Change = $25 - $30 = -$5

Since the change is negative, this means that Jenny did not have enough money to pay for the 15 roses.

Step 4: Determine the number of quarters Jenny will receive as change.
Since the florist only has quarters for change, and Jenny did not have enough money, she will not receive any quarters as change.

Final answer:
Jenny will not receive
