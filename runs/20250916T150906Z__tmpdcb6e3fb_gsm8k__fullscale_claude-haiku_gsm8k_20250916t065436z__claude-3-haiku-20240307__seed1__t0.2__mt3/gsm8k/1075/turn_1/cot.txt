Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen.
2. Jenny bought 15 roses.
3. To calculate the cost of 15 roses:
   * 15 roses at $2 each = 15 x $2 = $30

4. Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of $25.
5. The total cost of the 15 roses is $30, so Jenny needs to pay an additional $5.
6. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to calculate how many quarters Jenny will receive.
   * $5 / $0.25 (value of a quarter) = 20 quarters

Therefore, the final answer is that Jenny will leave with 20 quarters.
