Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each.
- The seller gave the buyer $4000 in dollar bills.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.
Total cost of phones = 5 phones Ã— $700 per phone = $3,500

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change the seller needs to give back.
Amount of change = Amount given by the seller - Total cost of phones
Amount of change = $4,000 - $3,500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change.

Final answer: The seller will give back $500 in change.
