Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bouncy ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
- The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony in the mall.
- Each story in the mall is 24 feet high.

Step 1: Calculate the starting height of the ball.
The ball is dropped from the third-floor balcony, and each story is 24 feet high.
Starting height = 3 stories × 24 feet per story = 72 feet

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first bounce.
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
Height of the first bounce = 2/3 × 72 feet = 48 feet

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second bounce.
The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.
Height of the second bounce = 2/3 × 48 feet = 32 feet

Therefore, the ball goes up to 32 feet on its second bounce
