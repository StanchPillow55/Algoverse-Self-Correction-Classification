Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.
- The salad costs $6.
- The yogurt is half the price of the salad.
- The total cost of her goods is $11 per day.

Step 1: Find the cost of the yogurt.
Cost of the yogurt = 1/2 × Cost of the salad
Cost of the yogurt = 1/2 × $6 = $3

Step 2: Find the total cost of the salad and the yogurt.
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = Cost of the salad + Cost of the yogurt
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = $6 + $3 = $9

Step 3: Find the cost of the two carrots.
Total cost of the goods = $11
Total cost of the salad and the yogurt = $9
Cost of the two carrots = Total cost of the goods - Total cost of the salad and the yogurt
Cost of the two carrots
