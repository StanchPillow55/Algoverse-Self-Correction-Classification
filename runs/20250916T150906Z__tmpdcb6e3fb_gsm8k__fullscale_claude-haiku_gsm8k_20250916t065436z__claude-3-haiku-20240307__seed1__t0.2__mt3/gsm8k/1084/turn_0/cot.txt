Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them.
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

To find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets.

Step 1: Let's represent Sam's portion as x.
Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's portion can be represented as x + 60.

Step 2: We know that the total fence is 100 feet, so we can set up an equation:
x + (x + 60) = 100

Step 3: Simplify the equation:
2x + 60 = 100

Step 4: Solve for x:
2x = 100 - 60
2x = 40
x = 20

Therefore, Sam's portion is 20 feet.

Step 5: To find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we subtract Sam's portion from the total fence:
Total fence - Sam's portion = Fence left over for Sam
100 feet
