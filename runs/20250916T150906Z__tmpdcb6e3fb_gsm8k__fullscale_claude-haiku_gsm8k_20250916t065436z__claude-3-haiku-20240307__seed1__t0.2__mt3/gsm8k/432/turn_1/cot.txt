Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons with his sword.
- Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus using a spear.
- Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur using a rusty iron axe.
- Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter using a nail file.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur.
Prince Arthur slew three-quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
Number of dragons slain by Prince Arthur = 3/4 × 100 = 75 dragons

Step 2: Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Walter.
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
Number of dragons slain by Prince Walter = 2 × 75 = 150 dragons

Step 3: Calculate the number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce.
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
Number of dragons slain by Prince Bruce = 1/5 ×
