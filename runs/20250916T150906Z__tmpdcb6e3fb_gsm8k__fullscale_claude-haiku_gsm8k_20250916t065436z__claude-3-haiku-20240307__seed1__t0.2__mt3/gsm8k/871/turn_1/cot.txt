Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Tobias bought a pizza with 60 pieces.

2. On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces:
   * 2/5 of 60 = 0.4 x 60 = 24 pieces

3. On the second day, he ate 10 pieces.

4. On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces:
   * Remaining pieces = 60 - 24 - 10 = 26 pieces
   * 7/13 of 26 = 0.5384 x 26 = 14 pieces

5. Total pieces eaten:
   * First day: 24 pieces
   * Second day: 10 pieces
   * Third day: 14 pieces
   * Total = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces

Therefore, the final answer is that Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far.
