Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The pizza has 60 pieces.
- On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pieces.
- On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
- On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
2/5 of 60 pieces = 2/5 Ã— 60 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day.
Total pieces - Pieces eaten on the first day = Remaining pieces
60 - 24 = 36 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day.
Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the second day.
Remaining pieces after the first day - Pieces eaten on the second day = Remaining pieces
36 - 10 = 26 pieces

Step 5
