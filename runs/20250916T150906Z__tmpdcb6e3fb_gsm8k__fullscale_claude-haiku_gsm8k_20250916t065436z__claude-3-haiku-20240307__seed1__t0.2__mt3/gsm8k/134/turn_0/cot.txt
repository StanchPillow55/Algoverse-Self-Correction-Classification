Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tom gets 4 car washes a month.
- Each car wash costs $15.

To find the total amount Tom pays in a year, we need to calculate the monthly cost and then multiply it by 12 months.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of car washes.
Monthly cost = Number of car washes per month × Cost per car wash
Monthly cost = 4 × $15 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the yearly cost of car washes.
Yearly cost = Monthly cost × Number of months in a year
Yearly cost = $60 × 12 = $720

Therefore, the total amount Tom pays for car washes in a year is $720.

Final answer: Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.
