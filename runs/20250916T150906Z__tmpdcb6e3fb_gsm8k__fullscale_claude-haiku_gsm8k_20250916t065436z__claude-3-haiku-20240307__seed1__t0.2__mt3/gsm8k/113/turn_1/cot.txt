Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ryan plants 2 flowers a day in his garden.
- After 15 days, 5 flowers did not grow.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers planted in 15 days.
Number of flowers planted per day = 2
Number of days = 15
Total number of flowers planted = 2 flowers/day Ã— 15 days = 30 flowers

Step 2: Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow.
Total number of flowers planted = 30 flowers
Number of flowers that did not grow = 5 flowers
Number of flowers that grew = 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

Therefore, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.
