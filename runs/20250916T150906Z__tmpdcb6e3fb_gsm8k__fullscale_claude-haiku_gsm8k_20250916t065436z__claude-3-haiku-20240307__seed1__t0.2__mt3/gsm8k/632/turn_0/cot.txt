Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.
- Max bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps.
- Max bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps.

Step 1: Find the number of truck stamps.
Number of truck stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + 3
Number of truck stamps = 16 + 3 = 19

Step 2: Find the number of rose stamps.
Number of rose stamps = Number of truck stamps - 9
Number of rose stamps = 19 - 9 = 10

Step 3: Find the total number of stamps Max bought.
Total number of stamps = Number of snowflake stamps + Number of truck stamps + Number of rose stamps
Total number of stamps = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45

Therefore, Max bought a total of 45 stamps.
