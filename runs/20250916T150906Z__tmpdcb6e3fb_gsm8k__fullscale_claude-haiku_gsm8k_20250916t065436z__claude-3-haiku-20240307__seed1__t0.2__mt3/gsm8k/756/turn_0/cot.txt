To solve this problem, we need to find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.

Given information:
- The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.
- There are 33 people on the council.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of votes against the new regulation.
- Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x.

We know that the total number of votes is equal to the number of people on the council, which is 33.

Total votes = Votes in favor + Votes against
33 = 2x + x
33 = 3x

Solving for x:
x = 33 / 3
x = 11

Therefore, the number of votes against the new regulation is 11.

Now, we can find the number of votes in favor of the new regulation:
Votes in favor = 2x
Votes in favor = 2 Ã— 11
Votes in favor = 22

Therefore, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was 22.

Final answer: The number of
