Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend.

2. At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.
   * 1 pound at $3 = $3
   * 1 pound at 1/2 off = $1.50
   * Total cost of 2 pounds of taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50

3. Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.

4. Sally bought 4 magnets at $0.25 each.
   * 4 magnets x $0.25 = $1.00

5. To calculate the total amount spent:
   * Taffy: $4.50
   * Seashells: $1.50
   * Magnets: $1.00
   * Total spent: $4.50 + $1.50 + $1
