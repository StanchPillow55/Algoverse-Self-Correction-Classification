Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sally's parents gave her $10 to spend.
- At the trinket shop, taffy was on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."
- Sally bought 2 pounds of taffy.
- Sally also bought a mixed bag of seashells for $1.50.
- Sally bought 4 magnets that were $0.25 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the taffy.
Since the sale was "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off," the cost of 2 pounds of taffy would be:
- 1 pound at $3 + 1 pound at $1.50 (1/2 off) = $4.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the seashells.
Cost of seashells = $1.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the magnets.
Cost of 4 magnets = 4 Ã— $0.
