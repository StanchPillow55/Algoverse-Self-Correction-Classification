Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.
- After the first month, she collected three times the initial number of cards.
- In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month.
- In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards from the first and second months.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the first month.
Initial number of cards = 20
Cards collected in the first month = 3 Ã— 20 = 60 cards

Step 2: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the second month.
Cards collected in the second month = Cards collected in the first month - 20
Cards collected in the second month = 60 - 20 = 40 cards

Step 3: Calculate the combined number of cards Elaine collected in the first and second months.
Combined cards from the first and second months = 60 + 40 = 100 cards

Step 4: Calculate the number of cards Elaine collected in the
