To solve this problem, we need to find the total revenue John earns from renting his car and then subtract the car payment to determine his profit.

Given information:
- John rents his car out 10 times a month.
- Each rental is for 3 hours.
- John gets paid $25 per hour.
- John's car payment is $500 per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue John earns from renting his car.
Total rental hours per month = 10 rentals × 3 hours per rental = 30 hours
Total revenue = Total rental hours × Hourly rate
Total revenue = 30 hours × $25 per hour = $750

Step 2: Calculate John's profit by subtracting the car payment from the total revenue.
Profit = Total revenue - Car payment
Profit = $750 - $500 = $250

Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car.

Final answer: John makes a profit of $250 on his car.
