Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Total number of shells found: 700

2. Team Alphas found 40% of the 700 shells:
   * 40% of 700 = 0.40 x 700 = 280 shells

3. Remaining shells after Team Alphas:
   * 700 - 280 = 420 shells

4. Team The finders found 60% of the remaining 420 shells:
   * 60% of 420 = 0.60 x 420 = 252 shells

5. Remaining shells after Team The finders:
   * 420 - 252 = 168 shells

6. Therefore, the number of shells found by Team Gogetters is:
   * 168 shells

Final answer: Team Gogetters found 168 shells.
