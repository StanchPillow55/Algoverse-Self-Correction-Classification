To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
2. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
3. Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
4. Calculate the number of shells remaining after team The finders' findings.
5. Calculate the number of shells found by team Gogetters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas.
Total shells found = 700
Alphas found 40% of the shells
Shells found by Alphas = 700 × 0.40 = 280 shells

Step 2: Calculate the number of shells remaining after team Alphas' findings.
Shells remaining = Total shells - Shells found by Alphas
Shells remaining = 700 - 280 = 420 shells

Step 3: Calculate the number of shells found by team The finders.
The finders found 60% of the remaining shells
Shells found by The finders = 420 × 0.60 = 252 shells
