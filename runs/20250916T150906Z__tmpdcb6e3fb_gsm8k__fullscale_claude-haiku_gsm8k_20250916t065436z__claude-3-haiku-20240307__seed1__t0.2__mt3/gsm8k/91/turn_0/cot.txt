Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
- Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
- Cindy has four pets.

Step 1: Find the number of pets Marcia has.
Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.
Cindy has 4 pets.
Therefore, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Step 2: Find the number of pets Jan has.
Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
Marcia has 6 pets.
Therefore, Jan has 3 Ã— 6 = 18 pets.

Step 3: Find the total number of pets the three have.
Total pets = Jan's pets + Marcia's pets + Cindy's pets
Total pets = 18 + 6 + 4 = 28 pets

Therefore, the three have a total of 28 pets.
