To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops.

Given information:
- Henry's total bike trip was 60 miles.
- He made his first stop after 20 miles.
- His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip.

Step 1: Find the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip.
Distance from second stop to end of trip = 15 miles

Step 2: Find the distance from the first stop to the end of the trip.
Distance from first stop to end of trip = 60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

Step 3: Find the distance between the first and second stops.
Distance between first and second stops = Distance from first stop to end of trip - Distance from second stop to end of trip
Distance between first and second stops = 40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

Therefore, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.

Final answer: Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.
