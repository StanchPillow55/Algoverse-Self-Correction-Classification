To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

Given information:
- Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument.
- Each box of popsicles contains 8 popsicle sticks.
- Each box of popsicles costs $2.00.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy.
Number of popsicle sticks needed / Number of popsicle sticks per box = Number of boxes needed
56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle sticks per box = 7 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the popsicle sticks.
Number of boxes needed × Cost per box = Total cost
7 boxes × $2.00 per box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.
