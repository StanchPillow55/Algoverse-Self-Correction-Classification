Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob has a certain number of marbles.
- If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
- If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?

Step 1: Find the number of marbles Bob had initially.
2 dozen = 24 marbles
Bob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more.
Initial number of marbles = 60 - 24 = 36 marbles

Step 2: Find the number of marbles Bob will have after losing 10 marbles.
Number of marbles after losing 10 = 36 - 10 = 26 marbles

Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles.
