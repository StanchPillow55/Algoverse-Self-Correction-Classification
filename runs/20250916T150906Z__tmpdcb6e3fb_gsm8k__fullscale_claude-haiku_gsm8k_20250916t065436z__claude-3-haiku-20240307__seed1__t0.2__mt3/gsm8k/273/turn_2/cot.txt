Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches.
4. The total number of stitches for the whole sweater is 1800.

Now, we need to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

Let's call the number of stitches for each sleeve 'x'.

We know that:
* Body: 900 stitches
* Collar: 90 stitches
* Rosette: 180 stitches
* Total: 1800 stitches

So, the equation is:
* 900 + 90 + 180 + 2x = 1800

Solving for x:
* 2x = 1800 - 900 -
