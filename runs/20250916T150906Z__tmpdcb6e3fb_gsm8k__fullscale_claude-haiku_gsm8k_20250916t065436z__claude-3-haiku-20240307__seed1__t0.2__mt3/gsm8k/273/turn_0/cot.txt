Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
- The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.
Stitches for the collar = 1/10 of 900 stitches = 90 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette.
Stitches for the rosette = 2 Ã— 90 stitches = 180 stitches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette.
Total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches

Step 4: Calculate the number of stitches for the two sleeves.
Total stitches for the swe
