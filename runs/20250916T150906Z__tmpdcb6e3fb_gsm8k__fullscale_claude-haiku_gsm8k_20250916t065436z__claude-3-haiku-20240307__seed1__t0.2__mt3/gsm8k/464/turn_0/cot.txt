To solve this problem, we need to keep track of Finley's position throughout the race and then determine the final place she finished in.

Given information:
- Finley started the race in first place.
- She fell back 5 spots.
- She then moved ahead 2 spots.
- She then fell behind 3 spots.
- Finally, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.

Step 1: Determine Finley's position after falling back 5 spots.
Starting position: 1st place
Falling back 5 spots: 1st place - 5 = 6th place

Step 2: Determine Finley's position after moving ahead 2 spots.
Position after falling back: 6th place
Moving ahead 2 spots: 6th place - 2 = 4th place

Step 3: Determine Finley's position after falling behind 3 spots.
Position after moving ahead: 4th place
Falling behind 3 spots: 4th place + 3 = 7th place

Step 4: Determine Finley
