Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Finley started off in first place.

2. She then fell back 5 spots. 
   * If she started in 1st place and fell back 5 spots, that means she is now in 6th place.

3. She then moved ahead 2 spots.
   * If she was in 6th place and moved ahead 2 spots, that means she is now in 4th place.

4. She then fell behind 3 spots.
   * If she was in 4th place and fell behind 3 spots, that means she is now in 7th place.

5. Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot to finish the race.
   * If she was in 7th place and jumped ahead 1 spot, that means she finished the race in 6th place.

Therefore, the final place Finley finished the 100-meter race in is 6th place.
