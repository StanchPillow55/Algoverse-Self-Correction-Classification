Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   * In the first 3 hours, she can run:
     * 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour.
   * For the remaining 4 hours (7 hours total - 3 hours), she can run:
     * 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

3. To find the total miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the miles from the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours:
   * 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.
