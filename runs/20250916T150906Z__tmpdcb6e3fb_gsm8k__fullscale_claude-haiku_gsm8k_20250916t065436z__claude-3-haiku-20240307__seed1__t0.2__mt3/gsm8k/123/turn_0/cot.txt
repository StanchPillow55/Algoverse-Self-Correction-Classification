Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
- After that, she runs 5 miles per hour.
- We need to find how many miles she can run in 7 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Step 2: Calculate the remaining time Rosie has to run at 5 miles per hour.
Total time = 7 hours
Time already used = 3 hours
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Step 3: Calculate the distance Rosie can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.
Total
