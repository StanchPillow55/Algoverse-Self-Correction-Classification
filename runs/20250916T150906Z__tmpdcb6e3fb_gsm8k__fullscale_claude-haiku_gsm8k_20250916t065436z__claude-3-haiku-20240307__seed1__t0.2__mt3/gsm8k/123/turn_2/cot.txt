Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   * In 3 hours, she can run 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour.
   * She has 4 hours left (7 hours total - 3 hours).
   * In the remaining 4 hours, she can run 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

3. To find the total miles she can run in 7 hours:
   * Total miles = Miles in first 3 hours + Miles in remaining 4 hours
   * Total miles = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.
