Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Patricia initially had 30 roses.
- She gave 24 roses to her mother.
- She then bought 15 more roses.

Step 1: Calculate the number of roses Patricia had after giving 24 to her mother.
Initial number of roses - Roses given to mother = Remaining roses
30 - 24 = 6 roses

Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses Patricia has after buying 15 more.
Remaining roses + Roses bought = Total roses
6 + 15 = 21 roses

Therefore, the final number of roses Patricia has is 21.

Final answer: Patricia has 21 roses.
