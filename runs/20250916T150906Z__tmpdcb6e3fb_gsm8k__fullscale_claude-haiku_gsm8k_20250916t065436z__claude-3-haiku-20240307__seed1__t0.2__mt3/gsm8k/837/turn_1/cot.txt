Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The new laptop costs $600.
- If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by $200.
- Erika has been paid $150 this week for her part-time job.
- Erika's mom agrees to give her $80 to help.
- Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the laptop after the trade-in.
Original price of the laptop: $600
Discount from trade-in: $200
Discounted price of the laptop: $600 - $200 = $400

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Erika has.
Money from part-time job: $150
Money from mom: $80
Total money Erika has: $150 + $80 = $230

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Erika still needs to buy the laptop.
Discounted price of the laptop: $400
Total money Erika has: $230
