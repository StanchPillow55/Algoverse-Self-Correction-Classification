To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Erika has available to buy the laptop, and then subtract the amount she still needs to pay to determine the amount of money she has in her purse.

Given information:
- The laptop costs $600.
- The price of the laptop is reduced by $200 if Erika trades in her old laptop.
- Erika has been paid $150 this week for her part-time job.
- Erika's mom agrees to give her $80 to help her.
- Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the laptop after the trade-in.
Original price of the laptop = $600
Discount from trade-in = $200
Discounted price of the laptop = $600 - $200 = $400

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Erika has available to buy the laptop.
Money from part-time job = $150
Money from Erika's mom = $80
Total amount of money available = $150 + $80 = $230
