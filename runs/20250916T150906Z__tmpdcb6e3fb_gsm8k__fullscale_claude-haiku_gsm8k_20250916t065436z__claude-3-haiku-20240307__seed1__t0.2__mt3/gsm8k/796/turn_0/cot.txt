To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.

Given information:
- The company hires 20 new employees every month.
- The company's initial employee number is 200.
- Each employee is paid a $4,000 salary per month.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
Initial employee number = 200
New employees hired in the first month = 20
New employees hired in the second month = 20
New employees hired in the third month = 20
Total number of employees after three months = 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.
Total amount of money paid to employees per month = Number of employees × Salary per employee
Total amount of money paid to employees in the first month = 200 × $4,000 = $800,000
Total amount of money paid to employees in the second month = 220 × $4,000 = $880,000
Total amount of
