Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company hires 20 new employees every month.
- The company's initial employee number is 200.
- Each employee is paid a $4,000 salary per month.
- We need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.
Initial number of employees: 200
New employees hired in the first month: 20
New employees hired in the second month: 20
New employees hired in the third month: 20
Total number of employees after three months = 200 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 260 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to the employees after three months.
Salary per employee per month: $4,000
Total salary paid in the first month = 200 employees × $4,000 = $800,000
Total salary paid in the second month = 220 employees × $4,000 = $880,000
Total salary paid in the third month = 240
