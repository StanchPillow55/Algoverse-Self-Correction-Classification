To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to reach their respective homes, and then calculate the difference between the two times to determine how long the winner will be waiting.

Given information:
- Steve lives 3 miles from the school and can bike at 440 feet per minute.
- Tim lives 2 miles from the school and can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.

Step 1: Convert the distances to feet.
Steve's distance = 3 miles × 5,280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet
Tim's distance = 2 miles × 5,280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach his home.
Time for Steve = Distance / Speed
Time for Steve = 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach his home.
Time for Tim = Distance / Speed
Time for Tim = 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes

Step 4:
