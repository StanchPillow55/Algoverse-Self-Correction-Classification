Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Zaid's monthly salary is $6,000.
- Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent.
- Zaid spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel.
- Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
- Zaid gives his daughter $200 for weekly expenses.
- Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods.

Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on rent.
Rent = 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500

Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
Car fuel = 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
Remaining amount = $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500

Step 4: Calculate the amount donated to charity.
Donation to charity = 1/2 of $2,500
