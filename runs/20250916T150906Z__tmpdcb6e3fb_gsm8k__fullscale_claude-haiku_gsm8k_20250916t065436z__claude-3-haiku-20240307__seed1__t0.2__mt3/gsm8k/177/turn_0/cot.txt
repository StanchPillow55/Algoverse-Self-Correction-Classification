To solve this problem, we need to calculate Zaid's expenses and donations, and then subtract them from his monthly salary to find the remaining amount.

Given information:
- Zaid's monthly salary is $6,000.
- Rent: 1/4 of his salary
- Car fuel: 1/3 of his salary
- Charity donation: 1/2 of the remaining amount after rent and car fuel
- Daughter's weekly expenses: $200
- Wife's grocery and household expenses: $700

Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on rent.
Rent = 1/4 of $6,000 = $1,500

Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on car fuel.
Car fuel = 1/3 of $6,000 = $2,000

Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel.
Remaining amount = $6,000 - $1,500 - $2,000 = $2,500

Step 4: Calculate the amount donated to charity.
Charity donation = 1/2 of $2,500 = $1,250
