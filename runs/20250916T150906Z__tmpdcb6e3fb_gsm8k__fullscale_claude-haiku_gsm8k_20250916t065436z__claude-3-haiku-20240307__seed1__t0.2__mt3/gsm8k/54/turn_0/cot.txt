To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has after the two house cats have had their litters.

Given information:
- The Doubtfire sisters have 7 adopted kittens.
- Patchy, the first cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
- Trixie, the other cat, has had 12 kittens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had.
Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens.
Number of kittens Patchy has had = 3 Ã— 7 = 21 kittens

Step 2: Calculate the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has.
Total number of kittens = Number of adopted kittens + Number of kittens Patchy has had + Number of kittens Trixie has had
Total number of kittens = 7 + 21 + 12 = 40 kittens

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has a total of
