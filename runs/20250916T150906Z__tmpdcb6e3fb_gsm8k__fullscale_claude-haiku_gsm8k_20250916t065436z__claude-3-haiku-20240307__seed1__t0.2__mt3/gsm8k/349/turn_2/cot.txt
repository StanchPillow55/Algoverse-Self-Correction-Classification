Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of food.
Food cost per week = $25
Food cost per month = $25 × 4 weeks = $100

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly cost for Madeline's dog.
Monthly cost of food = $100
Monthly cost of treats = $20
Monthly cost of medicine = $100
Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

Step 3: Calculate the total yearly cost for Madeline's dog.
Total yearly cost = Total monthly cost × 12 months
Total yearly cost = $220 × 12 = $2,640

Therefore, Madeline spends $2,640 on her dog per year.
