Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Two candidates are running for class representative
- The winner got 3/4 of the votes
- The total number of students who voted in the class was 80

To find the number of votes the loser got, we need to first find the number of votes the winner got, and then subtract that from the total number of votes.

Step 1: Find the number of votes the winner got.
Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate this as:
3/4 Ã— 80 = 60 votes

Step 2: Find the number of votes the loser got.
Total votes = 80
Votes for the winner = 60
Votes for the loser = Total votes - Votes for the winner
Votes for the loser = 80 - 60 = 20 votes

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes.
