Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rachel bought 23 cookies.
- Janet gave her 42 cookies.
- Rachel's brother ate 44 of those cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had.
Total cookies = Cookies Rachel bought + Cookies Janet gave
Total cookies = 23 + 42 = 65 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Rachel's brother ate.
Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother = 44

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies left for Rachel.
Cookies left for Rachel = Total cookies - Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother
Cookies left for Rachel = 65 - 44 = 21 cookies

Therefore, the number of cookies left for Rachel is 21 cookies.
