Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Rachel bought 23 cookies.
2. Janet gave her 42 cookies.
3. So the total number of cookies Rachel had is 23 + 42 = 65 cookies.
4. Her brother then ate 44 of those cookies.
5. To find the number of cookies left, we need to subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies Rachel had.
6. 65 cookies - 44 cookies = 21 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that Rachel has 21 cookies left.
