Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- Jane counts a zebra with 36 stripes.
- Jane counts another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.
Zebra 1: 17 stripes
Zebra 2: 17 stripes
Zebra 3: 36 stripes
Zebra 4: 36 stripes / 2 = 18 stripes

Total number of stripes = 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

Step 2: Calculate the average number of stripes on the zebras.
Average number of stripes = Total number of stripes / Number of zebras
Average number of stripes = 88 stripes / 4 zebras = 22 stripes

Therefore, the zebras have an average of 22 stripes.

Final answer: The
