To solve this problem, we need to find the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family, and then divide that number equally among the graduates.

Given information:
- The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people.
- 950 seats are reserved for graduates.
- 300 seats are reserved for faculty attending.

Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family.
Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center - Seats for graduates - Seats for faculty = Remaining seats for friends and family
6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats

Step 2: Calculate the number of tickets each graduate will receive.
Remaining seats for friends and family / Number of graduates = Tickets per graduate
4750 / 950 = 5 tickets per graduate

Therefore, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

Final answer: Each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.
