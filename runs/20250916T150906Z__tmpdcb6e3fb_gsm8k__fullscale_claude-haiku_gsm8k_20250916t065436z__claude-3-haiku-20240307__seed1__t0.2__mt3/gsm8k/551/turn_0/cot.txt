Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each
- Carly orders 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each
- Carly orders 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each
- Carly pays with one fifty-dollar bill

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items Carly ordered.
Cost of hamburgers = 5 × $4 = $20
Cost of potato fries = 10 × $0.30 = $3
Cost of fruit drinks = 5 × $2 = $10
Total cost = $20 + $3 + $10 = $33

Step 2: Calculate the amount of change Carly will receive.
Carly paid with one fifty-dollar bill, so the amount paid is $50.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $50 - $33 = $17

Therefore, the change Carly will receive is $17.
