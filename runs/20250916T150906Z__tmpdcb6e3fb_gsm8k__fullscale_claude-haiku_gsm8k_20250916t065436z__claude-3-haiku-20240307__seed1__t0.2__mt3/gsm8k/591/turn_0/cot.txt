Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The first dog is an Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.
- The second dog is a Dachshund, who weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
- The third dog is a Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
- The fourth dog is a Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of the Dachshund.
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × Weight of Affenpinscher
Weight of Dachshund = 2 × 10 pounds = 20 pounds

Step 2: Calculate the weight of the Papillon.
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × Weight of Dachshund
Weight of Papillon = 1/4 × 20 pounds = 5 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the weight of the Mastiff.
Weight of Mastiff = 44
