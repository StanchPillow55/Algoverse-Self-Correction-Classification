Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.
- She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.

Step 1: Calculate how much Jessica sets aside for shoes each month.
25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 × $2,000.00 = $500.00

Step 2: Calculate how much Jessica can save for shoes in a year.
Amount saved per month = $500.00
Amount saved in a year = $500.00 × 12 months = $6,000.00

Step 3: Calculate how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year.
Cost per pair of shoes = $1,000.00
Number of pairs of shoes = Total amount saved / Cost per pair
Number of pairs of shoes = $6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year.
