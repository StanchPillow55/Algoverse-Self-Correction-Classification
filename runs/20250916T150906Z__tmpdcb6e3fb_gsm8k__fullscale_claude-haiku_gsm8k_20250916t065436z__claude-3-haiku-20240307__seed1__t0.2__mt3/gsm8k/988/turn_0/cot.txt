Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month.
2. She sets aside 25% of her paycheck for fancy shoes.
3. To calculate how much she sets aside each month:
   * 25% of $2,000.00 = 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00

4. Now, we need to calculate how much she can save in a year:
   * $500.00 per month x 12 months = $6,000.00 saved in a year

5. Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00.
6. To calculate how many shoes she can buy in a year:
   * $6,000.00 saved / $1,000.00 per pair = 6 pairs of shoes

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jessica can buy 6 pairs of fancy shoes in a year.
