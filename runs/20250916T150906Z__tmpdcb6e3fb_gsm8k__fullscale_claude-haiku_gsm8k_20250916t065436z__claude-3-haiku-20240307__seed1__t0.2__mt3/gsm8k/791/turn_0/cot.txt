Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The train initially has 172 people traveling on it.
- At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more people get on.
- At the next stop, another 38 people get off.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the train after the first stop.
Initial number of people on the train = 172
Number of people who get off at the first stop = 47
Number of people who get on at the first stop = 13
Number of people on the train after the first stop = 172 - 47 + 13 = 138

Step 2: Calculate the number of people on the train after the second stop.
Number of people on the train after the first stop = 138
Number of people who get off at the second stop = 38
Number of people on the train after the second stop = 138 - 38 = 100

Therefore, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Final answer: There are 100 people on the train.
