Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.
   * This means the cost per sneaker is $576 / 48 = $12

2. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during the flash sale on Monday.
   * Revenue from flash sale = 17 x $20 = $340

3. The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each.
   * Revenue from department store = 31 x $25 = $775

4. Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store
   * Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1,115

5. Total cost = Cost of 48 sneakers
   * Total cost = $576

6. Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   * Profit = $1,115 - $576 = $539

Therefore, the salesman's profit is $539.
