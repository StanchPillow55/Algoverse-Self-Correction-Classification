Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.
- He sold 17 of them for $20 each at a flash sale on Monday.
- The remaining sneakers were sold to a department store for $25 each.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from the flash sale on Monday.
Revenue from flash sale = 17 sneakers × $20 per sneaker = $340

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from the department store sale.
Number of sneakers sold to the department store = 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers
Revenue from department store sale = 31 sneakers × $25 per sneaker = $775

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue.
Total revenue = Revenue from flash sale + Revenue from department store sale
Total revenue = $340 + $775 = $1,115

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the sneakers.
Cost of the sneakers = $576

Step 5: Calculate the profit.
Profit = Total revenue - Cost of the sneakers
