Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Step 1: Convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet.
1 foot = 12 inches
Rolls: 300 rolls × 4 inches/roll = 1,200 inches
Rolls in feet = 1,200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
Croissants: 120 croissants × 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
Croissants in feet = 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

Step 2: Add up the lengths of all the baked goods.
Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet
