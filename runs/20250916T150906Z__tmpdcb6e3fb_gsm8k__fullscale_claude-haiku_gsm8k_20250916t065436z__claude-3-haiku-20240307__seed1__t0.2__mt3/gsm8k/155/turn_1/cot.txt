Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill bakes 300 rolls, each 4 inches long.
   * Total length of rolls = 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1,200 inches

2. Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, each 6 inches long.
   * Total length of croissants = 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

3. Bill bakes 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long.
   * 1 foot = 12 inches
   * Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette x 12 inches/foot = 1,440 inches

4. Now we need to add up the total length of all the baked goods:
   * Total length = 1,200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1,440 inches (baguettes)
   * Total length = 3,360 inches

5. To convert the total length
