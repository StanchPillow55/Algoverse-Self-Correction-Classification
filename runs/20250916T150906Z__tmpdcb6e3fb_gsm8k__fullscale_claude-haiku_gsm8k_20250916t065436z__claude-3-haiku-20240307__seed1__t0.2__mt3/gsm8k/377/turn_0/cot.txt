To solve this problem, we need to find the number of apples Lucy picked over the three days.

- Lucy sells apples at $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked and got $56.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did the previous day.

Number of apples picked on Wednesday = 2 Ã— 12 = 24 apples

Step 4: Calculate the total
