Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lucy sells apples for $4 per piece.
- On Monday, she sold all the apples picked.
- On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.
- On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples from the previous day.
- Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Lucy picked on Monday.
