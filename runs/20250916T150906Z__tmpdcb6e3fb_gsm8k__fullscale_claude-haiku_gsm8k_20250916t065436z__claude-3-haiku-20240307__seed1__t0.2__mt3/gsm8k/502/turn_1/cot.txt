Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Cherrie has 5 friends in total.
2. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
   * For the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each, that's 2 x 5 = 10 gifts.
3. The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each.
   * For the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each, that's 3 x 2 = 6 gifts.
4. Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts to surprise her friends.

Now, let's add up the total number of gifts Cherrie bought:
* Gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each: 10 gifts
* Gifts for the 3 friends who want 2 gifts each: 6 gifts
* Additional 10 random gifts: 10 gifts

Total gifts bought = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts

Therefore, the total number of gifts Cherrie bought is 26.
