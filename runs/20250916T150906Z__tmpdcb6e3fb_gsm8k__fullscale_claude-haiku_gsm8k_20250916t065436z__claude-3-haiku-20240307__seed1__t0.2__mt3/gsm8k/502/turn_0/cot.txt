To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought for her friends and the additional random gifts.

Given information:
- Cherrie has 5 friends.
- 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
- 3 of her friends want 2 gifts each.
- Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.

Total gifts for 5 friends = 10 gifts (for 2 friends) + 6 gifts (for 3 friends) = 16 gifts

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, including the additional 10
