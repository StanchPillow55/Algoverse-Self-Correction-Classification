Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each:
   * 15 boxes x 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks set off by the city

2. Hannah's house can see 40% of the city's fireworks:
   * 40% of 300 fireworks = 0.4 x 300 = 120 fireworks

3. Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard:
   * 3 boxes x 5 fireworks per box = 15 fireworks

4. To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see:
   * Fireworks from the city: 120
   * Fireworks from her backyard: 15
   * Total fireworks: 120 + 15 = 135 fireworks

Therefore, the total number of fireworks Hannah will see is 135.
