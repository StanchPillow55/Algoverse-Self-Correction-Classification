To solve this problem, we need to find the better price per flower and then calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at that price.

Given information:
- Flowers can be bought in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.
- Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers.

Step 1: Find the price per flower for each package option.
Price per flower for packages of 3:
Price per package = $2.50
Price per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.83

Price per flower for packages of 2:
Price per package = $1
Price per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50

Step 2: Determine the better price per flower.
The better price per flower is $0.50 for the packages of 2.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the better price.
Total cost for 18 flowers = 18 Ã— $0.50 = $9

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 18 flowers at the other price.
Total cost for
