To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, including the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

Given information:
- 44 seniors need to receive awards.
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- The etching on each picture frame costs an additional 20% of the frame cost.
- 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.
Cost of picture frames = 44 seniors × $20 per frame = $880

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the etching on the picture frames.
Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = $4
Total etching cost = 44 seniors × $4 per frame = $176

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins.
Cost of pins = 2 seniors × $5 per pin = $10

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cords for the officers.
Number of officers =
