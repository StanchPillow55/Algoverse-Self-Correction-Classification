Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- 44 seniors need to receive awards.
- Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
- Each picture frame needs to be etched with a logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.
- 2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.
Cost of picture frames = 44 seniors × $20 per frame = $880

Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on the picture frames.
Additional cost for etching = 20% of $880 = 0.20 × $880 = $176
Total cost of picture frames with etching = $880 + $176 = $1,056

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors.
Cost of pins = 2 seniors × $5 per pin = $10

Step 4: Calculate the
