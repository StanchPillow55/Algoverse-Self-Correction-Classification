Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

Step 1: Find the weight of each candied apple.
Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we can use the following equation:
Weight of each chocolate bar = 2 × Weight of each candied apple
40 grams = 2 × Weight of each candied apple
Weight of each candied apple = 40 grams / 2 = 20 grams

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars.
Total weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars × Weight of each chocolate bar
Total weight of chocolate bars = 25 × 40 grams = 1,000 grams

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the candied apples.
Total weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples × Weight of each candied apple
