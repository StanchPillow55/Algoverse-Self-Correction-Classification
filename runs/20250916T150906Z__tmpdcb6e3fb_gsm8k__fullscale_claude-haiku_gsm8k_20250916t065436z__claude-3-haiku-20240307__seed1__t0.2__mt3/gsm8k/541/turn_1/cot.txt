Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half, in order to hit his target.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in April.
Total savings target = $1125

Step 2: Divide the total savings target by the number of days in April to get the average daily savings.
Number of days in April = 30 days
Average daily savings = $1125 / 30 days = $37.50 per day

Step 3: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the first half of the month.
First half of the month = 15 days
Amount to save in the first half = 15 days Ã— $37.50 per day = $562.50

Step 4: Determine the amount Elvis needs to save in the second half of the month.
Second half of the month = 15 days
Total savings target - Amount saved in first half = Amount to save in second half
