Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
- In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half, in order to hit his target.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Elvis needs to save in April.

Second half of the month = 15 days
Amount to save in the
