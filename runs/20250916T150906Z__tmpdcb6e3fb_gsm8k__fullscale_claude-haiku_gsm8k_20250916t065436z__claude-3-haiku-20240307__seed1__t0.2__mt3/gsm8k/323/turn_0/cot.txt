To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
2. Determine the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes.
3. Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes.
4. Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the added cream.
5. Add the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream to find the total weakening of the iced coffee.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
* Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
* To cool the coffee by 65 degrees, we need 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes.

Step 2: Determine the total volume of the coffee after adding the ice cubes.
* Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
* With 5 ice cubes, the total volume of the coffee is reduced by 5 Ã— 12 = 60 milliliters.

Step 3: Calculate the
