Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
- Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
- Any added liquid also weakens the coffee.
- Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees.
- Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
Number of ice cubes = 65 degrees / 13 degrees per ice cube = 5 ice cubes

Step 2: Calculate the total weakening of the coffee due to the ice cubes.
Weakening due to ice cubes = 5 ice cubes Ã— 12 milliliters per ice cube = 60 milliliters

Step 3: Calculate the weakening of the coffee due to the added cream.
Weakening due to cream = 15 milliliters

Step 4: Calculate the total weakening of the coffee.
Total weakening = Weakening due to ice cubes + Weakening due to cream
