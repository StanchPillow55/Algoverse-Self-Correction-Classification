To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance hiked by Cho and Chloe, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance hiked by Cho.
Cho's distance = Cho's speed × Cho's time
Cho's distance = 14 kilometers per hour × 8 hours
Cho's distance = 112 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance hiked by Chloe.
Chloe's distance = Chloe's speed × Chloe's time
Chloe's distance = 9 kilometers per hour × 5 hours
Chloe's distance = 45 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Cho's and Chloe's distances.
Difference in distance = Cho's distance - Chloe's distance
Difference in distance = 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers
Difference in distance
