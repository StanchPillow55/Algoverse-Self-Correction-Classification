To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park and then find the difference to determine the savings.

Given information:
- First amusement park:
  - Adult fee: $26
  - Child fee: $12
- Second amusement park:
  - Adult fee: $14
  - Child fee: $10
- Family size: 2 adults and 2 children

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.
Total cost for the first amusement park = (2 adults × $26) + (2 children × $12)
Total cost for the first amusement park = $52 + $24 = $76

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.
Total cost for the second amusement park = (2 adults × $14) + (2 children × $10)
Total cost for the second amusement park = $28 + $20 = $48

Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the second amusement park over the first.
Savings = Total cost for the first a
