Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   * The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.
   * There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die:
   * The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6.
   * Probability of rolling the first even number = 3/6 = 1/2
   * Probability of rolling the second even number = 3/6 = 1/2
   * Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/2 Ã— 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%

3. Comparing the probabilities:
   * Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%
   * Probability of rolling two even
