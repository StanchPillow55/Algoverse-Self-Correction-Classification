Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die:
   * The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   * The total number of possible outcomes on a six-sided die is 6.
   * The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.

2. Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die:
   * The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   * The probability of rolling the first even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
   * The probability of rolling the second even number is also 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.
   * The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the individual probabilities: 1/2 Ã— 1/2 = 1/4 = 25%.
