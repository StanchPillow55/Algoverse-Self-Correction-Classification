To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probabilities of two events and then compare them.

The two events are:
1. Rolling a number greater than 3
2. Rolling two even numbers in a row

Let's start with the first event:
Rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
The possible outcomes greater than 3 are: 4, 5, and 6.
The total number of possible outcomes on a six-sided die is 6.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:
Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes
Probability = 3 / 6 = 1/2 = 50%

Now, let's consider the second event:
Rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die.
The possible even numbers are: 2, 4, and 6.
The probability of rolling the first even number is 3/6 = 1/2.
The probability of rolling the second even number is also 3/6 = 1/2.
The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the
