Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
2. The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
3. The landscaping company needs to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones and then divide that by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.
Total weight of flagstones = 80 flagstones Ã— 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Divide the total weight of the flagstones by the maximum weight capacity of the trucks.
Number of trucks needed = Total weight of flagstones / Maximum weight capacity of each truck
Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
