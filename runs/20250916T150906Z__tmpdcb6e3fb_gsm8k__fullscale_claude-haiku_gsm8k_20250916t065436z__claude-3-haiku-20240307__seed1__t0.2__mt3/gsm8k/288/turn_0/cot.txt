To solve this problem, we need to find the total weight of the flagstones and then determine how many trucks are required to transport them.

Given information:
- Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
- The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
- The customer needs to transport 80 flagstones.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.
Total weight of the flagstones = Number of flagstones × Weight of each flagstone
Total weight of the flagstones = 80 × 75 pounds = 6000 pounds

Step 2: Determine the number of trucks needed to transport the flagstones.
Number of trucks needed = Total weight of the flagstones / Total weight capacity of each truck
Since each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds, we need to find how many trucks are required to transport the 6000 pounds of flagstones.

Number of trucks needed = 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flag
