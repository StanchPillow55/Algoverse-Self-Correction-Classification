Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Reddit group has 1000 members.
- Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

To find the total number of posts the group will have in March, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of posts per day.
2. Multiply the total posts per day by the number of days in March.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of posts per day.
Total posts per day = Number of members × Average posts per member per day
Total posts per day = 1000 × 3 = 3000 posts

Step 2: Calculate the total number of posts in March.
March has 31 days.
Total posts in March = Total posts per day × Number of days in March
Total posts in March = 3000 × 31 = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the total number of posts that the Reddit group will have in March is 93,000 posts.
