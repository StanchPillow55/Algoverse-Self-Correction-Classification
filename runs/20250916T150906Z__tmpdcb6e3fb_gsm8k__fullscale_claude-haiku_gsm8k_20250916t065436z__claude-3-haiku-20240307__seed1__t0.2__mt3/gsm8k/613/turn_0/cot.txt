To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of posts the Reddit group will have in March.

Given information:
- The Reddit group has 1000 members.
- Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of posts per day.
Total posts per day = Number of members × Average posts per member per day
Total posts per day = 1000 × 3 = 3,000 posts

Step 2: Calculate the number of days in March.
March has 31 days.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of posts in March.
Total posts in March = Total posts per day × Number of days in March
Total posts in March = 3,000 posts per day × 31 days = 93,000 posts

Therefore, the Reddit group will have a total of 93,000 posts in March.

Final answer: The total number of posts that the Reddit group will have in March is 93,000.
