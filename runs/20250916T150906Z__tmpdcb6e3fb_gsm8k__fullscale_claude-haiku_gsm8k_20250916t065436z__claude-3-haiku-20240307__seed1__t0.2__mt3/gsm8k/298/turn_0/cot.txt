To solve this problem, we need to understand the bidding process and calculate the final cost of the desk for Carmen.

Given information:
- The opening bid for the desk is $200.
- The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.
- 3 other people each bid once.
- Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins.

Step 1: Determine the sequence of bids.
Opening bid: $200
Bid 1: $200 + $50 = $250 (by the first person)
Bid 2: $250 + $50 = $300 (by the second person)
Bid 3: $300 + $50 = $350 (by the third person)
Bid 4: $350 + $50 = $400 (by Carmen)

Step 2: Calculate the final cost of the desk for Carmen.
Final bid: $400

Therefore, the desk costs Carmen $400.

Final answer: The desk costs Carmen $400.
