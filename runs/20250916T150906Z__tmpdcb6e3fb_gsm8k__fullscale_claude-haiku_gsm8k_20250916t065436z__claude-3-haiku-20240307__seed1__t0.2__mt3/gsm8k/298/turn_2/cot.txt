Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The opening bid for the antique desk is $200.
- The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time.
- 3 other people each bid once.
- Carmen bids after each of the 3 other people and eventually wins.

To find the final cost of the desk, we need to calculate the amount of each bid and the total number of bids.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of each bid.
Opening bid: $200
First bid increase: $200 + $50 = $250
Second bid increase: $250 + $50 = $300
Third bid increase: $300 + $50 = $350

Step 2: Calculate the total number of bids.
There are 4 bids in total (3 other people's bids and Carmen's final winning bid).

Step 3: Calculate the final cost of the desk.
Final cost = Opening bid + (3 × Bid increase)
Final cost = $200 + (3 × $50)
Final cost = $200
