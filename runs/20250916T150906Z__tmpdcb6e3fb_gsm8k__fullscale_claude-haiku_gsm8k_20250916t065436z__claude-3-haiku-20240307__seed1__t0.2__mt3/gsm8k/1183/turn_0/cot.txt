To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of apples that fall out of the tree and the number of apples that Newton picks up and puts in his pocket.

Given information:
- Two apples fell out of the tree initially.
- Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket, and threw the other one into the tree.
- Throwing the apple into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.
- Newton picked up these 5 apples, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
- Throwing the apple at the tree caused another 6 apples to fall out.
- Newton picked up all the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree initially.
Initial apples that fell out of the tree = 2

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw the first apple.
Apples that fell out after the first throw = 5

Step 3: Calculate the number of apples that fell out of the tree after Newton threw
