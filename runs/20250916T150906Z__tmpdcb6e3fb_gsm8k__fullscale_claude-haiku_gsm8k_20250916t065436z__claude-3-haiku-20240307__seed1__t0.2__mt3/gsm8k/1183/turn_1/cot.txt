Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and 1 landed on Newton's head.
   * Newton picked up the 2 apples.

2. Newton put 1 apple in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.
   * Newton now has 1 apple in his pocket and 5 new apples on the ground.

3. Newton picked up the 5 new apples, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw the remaining 1 at the tree.
   * Newton now has 4 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples on the ground.

4. Newton picked up the 6 new apples.
   * Newton now has 4 apples in his pocket and 6 new apples.

Adding it all up:
* Initially: 2 apples
* After first throw: 1 apple in pocket, 5 new apples
* After second throw: 4 apples in pocket, 6
