Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree, and Newton picked them up.
2. Newton put one of the apples in his pocket and threw the other one back into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall.
3. Newton picked up the 5 apples that fell, put all but one in his pocket, and threw the remaining one at the tree.
4. This caused another 6 apples to fall.
5. Newton picked up all the remaining apples.

Let's calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home:
* Initial 2 apples
* 5 apples from the first throw
* 6 apples from the second throw
* Total = 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 apples

Therefore, the final answer is that Newton brought home 13 apples.
