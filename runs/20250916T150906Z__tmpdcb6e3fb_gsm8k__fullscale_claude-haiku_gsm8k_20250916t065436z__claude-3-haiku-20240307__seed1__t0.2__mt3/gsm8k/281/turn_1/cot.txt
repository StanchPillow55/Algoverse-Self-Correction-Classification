Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that a cobra has 70 spots.
2. We also know that a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
   * This means that a mamba has 70 / 2 = 35 spots.

3. There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.
   * The total number of spots on the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2,800 spots.
   * The total number of spots on the mambas is 60 * 35 = 2,100 spots.

4. The total number of spots on all the snakes is the sum of the spots on the cobras and the mambas:
   * 2,800 + 2,100 = 4,900 spots.

5. The question asks for half the number of spots they all have combined.
   * Half of 4,900 is 4,900 / 2 = 2,450 spots.

Therefore, the final answer is 2,450
