Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A cobra has 70 spots.
- A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
- There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.

Step 1: Find the number of spots on a mamba.
Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.
Number of spots on a mamba = 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots

Step 2: Find the total number of spots on all the cobras.
Total spots on cobras = Number of spots on a cobra × Number of cobras
Total spots on cobras = 70 × 40 = 2,800 spots

Step 3: Find the total number of spots on all the mambas.
Total spots on mambas = Number of spots on a mamba × Number of mambas
Total spots on mambas = 35 × 60 = 2,100
