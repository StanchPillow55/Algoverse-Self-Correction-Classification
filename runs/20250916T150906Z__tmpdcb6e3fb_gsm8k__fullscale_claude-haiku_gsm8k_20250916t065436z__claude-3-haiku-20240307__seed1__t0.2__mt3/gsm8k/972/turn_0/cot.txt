Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.
- She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
- She sold the rest.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.
Total number of oranges = 12 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 240 oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges she gave away to her mom and sister.
Oranges given to mom = 2 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges
Oranges given to sister = 2 boxes × 20 oranges per box = 40 oranges
Total oranges given away = 40 + 40 = 80 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges remaining after giving away the 4 boxes.
Remaining oranges = Total oranges - Oranges
