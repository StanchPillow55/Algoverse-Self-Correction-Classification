Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Miss Maria has 6 decks of 25 basketball cards each:
   * 6 decks x 25 cards per deck = 150 basketball cards

2. Miss Maria has 5 boxes of 40 baseball cards each:
   * 5 boxes x 40 cards per box = 200 baseball cards

3. The total number of cards Miss Maria has is:
   * 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = 350 cards

4. Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself, so the remaining cards are:
   * 350 cards - 50 cards = 300 cards

5. Each student gets 10 cards, so to find the number of students:
   * 300 cards / 10 cards per student = 30 students

Therefore, the final answer is that Miss Maria has 30 students.
