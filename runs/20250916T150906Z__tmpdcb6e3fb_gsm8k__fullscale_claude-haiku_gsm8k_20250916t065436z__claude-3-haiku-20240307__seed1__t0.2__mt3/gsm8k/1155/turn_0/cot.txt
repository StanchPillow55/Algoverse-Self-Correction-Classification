Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- John buys a cassette with 2 songs.
- The first song is 5 minutes long.
- The second song is 60% longer than the first song.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of the second song.
The second song is 60% longer than the first song.
Duration of the second song = Duration of the first song + 60% of the first song
Duration of the second song = 5 minutes + (0.6 Ã— 5 minutes)
Duration of the second song = 5 minutes + 3 minutes
Duration of the second song = 8 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total duration of the cassette.
Total duration of the cassette = Duration of the first song + Duration of the second song
Total duration of the cassette = 5 minutes + 8 minutes
Total duration of the cassette = 13 minutes

Therefore, the total time of the cassette is 13 minutes.
