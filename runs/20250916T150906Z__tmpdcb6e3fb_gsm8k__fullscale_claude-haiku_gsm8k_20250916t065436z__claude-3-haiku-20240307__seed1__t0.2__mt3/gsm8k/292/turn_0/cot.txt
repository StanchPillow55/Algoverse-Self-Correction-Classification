Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes for an online task.
- She works between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.
- She pauses for half an hour in between.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Susan works.
Total time = 11 a.m. - 8 a.m. = 3 hours
Pause time = 0.5 hours
Net working time = 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours = 150 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the number of 10-minute intervals Susan works.
Number of 10-minute intervals = 150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Susan earns.
Money earned per interval = $5
Total money earned = 15 intervals Ã— $5 per interval = $75

Therefore, the amount of money Susan earns for the online task is $75.
