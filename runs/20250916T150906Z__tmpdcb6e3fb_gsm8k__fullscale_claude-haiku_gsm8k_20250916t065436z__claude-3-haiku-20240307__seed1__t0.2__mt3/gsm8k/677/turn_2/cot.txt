Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carol has 20 signatures in her book.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book.
- They have 3 more weeks of summer vacation.
- Their goal is to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures they have collected so far.
Carol's signatures + Jennifer's signatures = Total signatures collected
20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Step 2: Calculate the remaining number of signatures they need to reach their goal.
Goal - Total signatures collected = Remaining signatures needed
100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Final answer: The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.
