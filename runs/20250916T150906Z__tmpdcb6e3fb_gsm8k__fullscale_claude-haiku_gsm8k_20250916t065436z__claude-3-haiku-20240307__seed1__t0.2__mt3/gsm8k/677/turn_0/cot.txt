To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
2. Determine the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100.
3. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
Carol's signatures: 20
Jennifer's signatures: 44
Total signatures collected so far = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures

Step 2: Determine the number of signatures they need to collect to reach their goal of 100.
Goal: 100 signatures
Signatures collected so far: 64 signatures
Signatures needed to reach the goal = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Final answer: The sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures.
