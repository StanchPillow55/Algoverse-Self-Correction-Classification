Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures.
2. The total number of signatures they have collected so far is 20 + 44 = 64.
3. Their goal is to reach 100 signatures between them by the end of the summer.
4. To calculate how many more signatures they need to reach their goal, we subtract the total they have now from their goal:
   100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.
