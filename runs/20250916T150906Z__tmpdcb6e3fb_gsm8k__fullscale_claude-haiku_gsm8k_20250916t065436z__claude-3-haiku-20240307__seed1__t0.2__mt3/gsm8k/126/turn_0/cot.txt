Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.
- Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish sausages Dylan bought.
Number of fish sausages = Number of chicken sausages + 6
Number of fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sausages Dylan bought.
Total number of sausages = Number of chicken sausages + Number of fish sausages
Total number of sausages = 38 + 44 = 82

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.

Final answer: Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.
