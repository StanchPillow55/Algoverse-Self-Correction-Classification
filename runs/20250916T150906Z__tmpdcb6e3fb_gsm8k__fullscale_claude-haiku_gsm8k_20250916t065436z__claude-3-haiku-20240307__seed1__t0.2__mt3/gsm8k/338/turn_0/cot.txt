To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in the smallest group.

Given information:
- The class has 200 students.
- The class is split into 3 groups.
- 2 of the groups are equal in number.
- The third group (the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of students in the two equal groups.
- Let y be the number of students in the smallest group.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of students.
Total number of students = Number of students in the two equal groups + Number of students in the smallest group
200 = 2x + y

Step 2: Find the relationship between the number of students in the two equal groups and the smallest group.
The smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so:
y = x - 10

Step 3: Substitute the expression for y in the equation from Step 1.
200 = 2x + (x - 10)
200 = 3x - 10
