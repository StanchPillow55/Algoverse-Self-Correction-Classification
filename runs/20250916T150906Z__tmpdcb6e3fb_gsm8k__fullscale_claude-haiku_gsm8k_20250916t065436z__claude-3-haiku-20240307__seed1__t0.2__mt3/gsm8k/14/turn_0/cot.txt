To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
20% of 20 students = 0.20 × 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Step 2: Calculate the number of students remaining after the contemporary dance enrollment.
Total students - Students enrolled in contemporary dance = Remaining students
20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 × 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Step 4: Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Total students - Students enrolled in contemporary dance - Students enrolled in jazz dance = Students enrolled in hip-hop dance
