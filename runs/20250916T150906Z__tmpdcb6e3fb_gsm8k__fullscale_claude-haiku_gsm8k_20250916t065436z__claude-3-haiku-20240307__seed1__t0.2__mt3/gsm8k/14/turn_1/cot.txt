Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have a dance class of 20 students.

2. 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   * 20% of 20 = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

3. The remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16 students.

4. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance.
   * 25% of 16 = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

5. The remaining students are 16 - 4 = 12 students.

6. The rest of the students, 12, enrolled in hip-hop dance.

7. To find the percentage of the entire class enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of hip-hop students by the total number of students:
   * 12 hip-hop students / 20 total students = 0.6 or 60%

Therefore, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop
