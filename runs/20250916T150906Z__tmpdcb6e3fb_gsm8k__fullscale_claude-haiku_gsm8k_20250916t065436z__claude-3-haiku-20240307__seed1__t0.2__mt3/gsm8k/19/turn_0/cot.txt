To solve this problem, we need to find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

Given information:
- The total distance of the trail is 12 miles.
- Marissa took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another 1 hour to walk the next 2 miles.
- Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Marissa has already walked.
Distance walked = 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles

Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance Marissa needs to walk.
Remaining distance = Total distance - Distance walked
Remaining distance = 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles

Step 3: Calculate the total time Marissa has already spent walking.
Total time spent = 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

Step 4: Calculate the average speed Marissa needs to achieve to reach her goal.
Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 12 miles / 4
