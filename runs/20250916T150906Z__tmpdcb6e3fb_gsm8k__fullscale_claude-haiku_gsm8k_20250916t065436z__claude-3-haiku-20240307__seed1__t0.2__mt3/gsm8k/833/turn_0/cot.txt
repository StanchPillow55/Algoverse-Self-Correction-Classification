To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the mountain-lifting abilities of the different characters and then use that to calculate the height that Naruto can lift a mountain.

Given information:
- Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
- Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
- Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
- Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

Step 1: Find the height that Saskay can lift a mountain.
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.
Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.

Step 2: Find the height that Kagiyami can lift a mountain.
Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high.

Step 3: Find the height that
