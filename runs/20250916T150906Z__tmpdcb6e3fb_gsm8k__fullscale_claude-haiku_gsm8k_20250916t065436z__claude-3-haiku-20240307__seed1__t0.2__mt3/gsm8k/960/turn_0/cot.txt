To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the pirates and then calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Given information:
- On the first day, they dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, they dug 8 holes, but they filled in 2 holes.
- The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
Holes dug on the first day = 10
Holes dug on the second day = 13
Holes dug on the third day = 8
Holes filled in on the third day = 2
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes on the island at the end of the fourth day.
Number of holes at the end of the first day = 10
