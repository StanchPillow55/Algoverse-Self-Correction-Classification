Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
- On the second day, the pirates dug 13 holes.
- On the third day, the pirates dug 8 holes, but they also filled in 2 holes.
- On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day.
Holes dug on the first day: 10
Holes dug on the second day: 13
Holes dug on the third day: 8
Holes filled in on the third day: 2
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes

Step 2: Calculate the number of holes at the end of the first day.
Total holes dug by the end of the third day = 29 holes
The island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as
