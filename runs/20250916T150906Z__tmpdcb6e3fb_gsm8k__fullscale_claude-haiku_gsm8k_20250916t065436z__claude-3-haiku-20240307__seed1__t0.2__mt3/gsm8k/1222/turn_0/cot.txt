Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 5 windows.
- Each window is 35 inches wide.
- Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.

Step 1: Calculate the total width of the windows.
Total width of the windows = Number of windows × Width of each window
Total width of the windows = 5 × 35 inches = 175 inches

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of fabric Luke needs to buy.
Total amount of fabric needed = 2 × Total width of the windows
Total amount of fabric needed = 2 × 175 inches = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric for the new curtains.

Final answer: Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.
