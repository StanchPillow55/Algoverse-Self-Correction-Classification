To solve this problem, we need to find the number of players on the defense.

Given information:
- The football team has 105 members.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of players on the defense.
- Let 2x be the number of players on the offense (since there are twice as many players on the offense as on the defense).
- Let x/2 be the number of players on the special teams (since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense).

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of players on the team.
Total number of players = Number of players on the offense + Number of players on the defense + Number of players on the special teams
105 = 2x + x + x/2
105 = 3.5x

Step 2: Solve for the number of players on the defense.
3.5x = 105
x = 105 /
