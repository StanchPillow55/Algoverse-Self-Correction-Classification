Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The football team has 105 members.
- There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense.
- There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of players on the defense
- Then 2x = the number of players on the offense
- And x/2 = the number of players on the special teams

We know that the total number of players is 105, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Simplifying the equation:
3.5x = 105
x = 30

Therefore, the number of players on the defense is 30.

Final answer: There are 30 players on the defense.
