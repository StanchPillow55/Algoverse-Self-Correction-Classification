Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Molly invited 16 people to the birthday party.
- 10 people want the chicken salad at $6.50 per person.
- 6 people want the pasta salad at $6 per person.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the chicken salad.
Cost of chicken salad = Number of people x Price per person
Cost of chicken salad = 10 x $6.50 = $65

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pasta salad.
Cost of pasta salad = Number of people x Price per person
Cost of pasta salad = 6 x $6 = $36

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the catering.
Total cost = Cost of chicken salad + Cost of pasta salad
Total cost = $65 + $36 = $101

Therefore, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is $101.
