To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad, and then add them together to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

Given information:

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.
Total amount Molly will pay = Total cost of chicken salad + Total cost of pasta salad
Total amount Molly will
