Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. When they made tractors:
   * They sold 10 tractors per day
   * They made $100 per tractor
   * Daily revenue = 10 tractors x $100 per tractor = $1,000 per day

2. Now they make silos:
   * They sell 5 silos per day
   * They make $220 per silo
   * Daily revenue = 5 silos x $220 per silo = $1,100 per day

3. To calculate the percentage increase:
   * Increase in daily revenue = $1,100 - $1,000 = $100
   * Percentage increase = (Increase in daily revenue) / (Original daily revenue) x 100
   * = ($100) / ($1,000) x 100
   * = 0.1 x 100
   * = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that they are making silos instead of tractors.
