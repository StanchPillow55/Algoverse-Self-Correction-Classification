To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of hours the candle burns and then multiply it by the rate at which the candle melts to find the total reduction in the candle's length.

Given information:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Step 1: Find the total number of hours the candle burns.
Time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM = 5 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total reduction in the candle's length.
Total reduction in length = Melting rate × Total burning time
Total reduction in length = 2 cm/hour × 5 hours
Total reduction in length = 10 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 10 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: The candle will be 10 centimeters shorter.
