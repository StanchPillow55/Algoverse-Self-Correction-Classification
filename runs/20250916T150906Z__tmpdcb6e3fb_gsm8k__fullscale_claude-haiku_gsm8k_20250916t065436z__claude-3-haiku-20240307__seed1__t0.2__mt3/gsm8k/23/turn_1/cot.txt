Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

To find how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burns and then multiply it by the melting rate.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the candle burns.
Time period: 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM
Total hours = 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total number of centimeters the candle melts.
Melting rate = 2 centimeters per hour
Total melting = Melting rate × Total hours
Total melting = 2 cm/hour × 4 hours = 8 centimeters

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Final answer: The can
