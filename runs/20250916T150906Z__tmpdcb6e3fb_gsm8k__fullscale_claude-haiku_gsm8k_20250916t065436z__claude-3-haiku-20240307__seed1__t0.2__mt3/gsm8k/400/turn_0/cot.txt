Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.
- John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
- Milk has 3 calories per ounce.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk John consumed.
Total milk consumed = 2 glasses × 8 ounces per glass = 16 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total calories in the milk John consumed.
Total calories = Total milk consumed × Calories per ounce
Total calories = 16 ounces × 3 calories per ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calories from the 2 glasses of milk.

Final answer: John consumed 48 calories from the 2 glasses of milk.
