Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ice cream parlor is offering a deal: buy 2 scoops of ice cream, get 1 scoop free.
- Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.
- Erin has $6.00 to spend.

To find the number of scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to determine the most efficient way to spend her $6.00 and get the maximum number of scoops.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 scoops of ice cream with the "buy 2, get 1 free" deal.
Cost of 2 scoops = 2 ร $1.50 = $3.00
Since the third scoop is free, the total cost for 3 scoops is $3.00.

Step 2: Determine the maximum number of scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00.
Maximum number of scoops = $6.00 รท $3.00 per 3 s
