Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of people at the party:
   * 25 men + 15 women = 40 people

2. After 1/4 of the total number of people left:
   * 1/4 of 40 = 10 people left the party
   * Remaining people = 40 - 10 = 30 people

3. We know that 22 men stayed at the party, so:
   * Number of men left = 22
   * Number of women left = Total people left - Number of men left
   * Number of women left = 30 - 22 = 8 women

Therefore, the final answer is:
8 women are left at the party.
