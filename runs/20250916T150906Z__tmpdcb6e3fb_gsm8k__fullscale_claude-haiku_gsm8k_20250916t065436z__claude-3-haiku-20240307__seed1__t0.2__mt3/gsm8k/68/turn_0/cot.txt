Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
- There are 60 girls.
- There are 5 students for every teacher.

Step 1: Find the number of boys.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60 = 120 boys

Step 2: Find the total number of students.
Total number of students = Number of boys + Number of girls
Total number of students = 120 + 60 = 180 students

Step 3: Find the number of teachers.
We know that there are 5 students for every teacher, so we can calculate the number of teachers as follows:
Number of teachers = Total number of students / 5 students per teacher
Number of teachers = 180 / 5 = 36 teachers

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
