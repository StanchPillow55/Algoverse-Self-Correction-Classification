Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour.
- She works 8 hours per day.
- If she needs to work additional hours, she is paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
- Last Tuesday, she worked 11 hours.

Step 1: Calculate Jamie's regular daily pay.
Regular daily pay = Regular hourly rate × Hours worked per day
Regular daily pay = $20 × 8 hours = $160

Step 2: Calculate Jamie's special hourly rate for additional hours.
Special hourly rate = 150% of regular hourly rate
Special hourly rate = 1.5 × $20 = $30 per hour

Step 3: Calculate the pay for the additional hours worked.
Additional hours worked = 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours
Pay for additional hours = Special hourly rate × Additional hours worked
Pay for additional hours = $30 × 3 hours = $90

Step 4: Calculate the total pay for the day.
