To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week.

Given information:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per day.
Sandwiches eaten by the man per day = 5
Sandwiches eaten by the wife per day = 4
Sandwiches eaten by the son per day = 2
Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week.
There are 7 days in a week.
Total sandwiches eaten in one week = Total sandwiches eaten per day × Number of days in a week
Total sandwiches eaten in one week = 11 sandwiches × 7 days = 77 sandwiches

Therefore, the family eats 77
