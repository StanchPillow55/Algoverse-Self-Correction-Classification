To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.

Given information:
- The family consists of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.
- Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into.
Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can consider the watermelon to be divided into 6 equal parts.

Step 2: Determine the size of each adult's slice.
Each adult's slice = 2 × size of each kid's slice
Since the watermelon is divided into 6 equal parts, each adult's slice = 2 × (1/6) = 1/3 of the watermelon.

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.
Percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets = (1/3) × 100% = 33.33%

Therefore, each adult gets 33.33% of the watermelon.
