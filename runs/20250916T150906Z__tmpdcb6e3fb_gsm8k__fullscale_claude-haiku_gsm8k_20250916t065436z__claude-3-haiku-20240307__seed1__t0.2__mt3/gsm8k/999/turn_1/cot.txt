Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The family consists of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.
- The adults are to get a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into.
Since the adults get a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can say that the total number of slices is 6 (2 adults + 4 kids).

Step 2: Determine the size of each adult's slice relative to the kid's slice.
As stated, the adult's slice is twice as big as the kid's slice. So, if the kid's slice is 1 unit, the adult's slice is 2 units.

Step 3: Calculate the total size of the watermelon.
Since the total number of slices is 6, and the adult's slice is 2 units while the kid's slice is 1 unit, the total
