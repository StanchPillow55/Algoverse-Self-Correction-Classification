Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch per day.
- Bobby takes 2 15-minute breaks per day.
- We need to find the total time of his lunches and breaks after 5 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total time of his lunches per day.
Lunch time per day = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time of his breaks per day.
Break time per day = 2 × 15 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time of his lunches and breaks per day.
Total time per day = Lunch time + Break time
Total time per day = 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 60 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the total time of his lunches and breaks after 5 days.
Total time after 5 days = Total time per day × 5 days
Total time after 5 days = 60 minutes × 5 days = 300 minutes

Step 5: Convert the total time from minutes to hours.
Total time in
