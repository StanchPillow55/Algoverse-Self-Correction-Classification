Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 20 kids on the school trip.
- They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- The boys brought back 60 shells each.
- The girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls.
Since the groups were divided equally, there must be 10 boys and 10 girls.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of shells brought back by the boys.
Number of boys × Number of shells per boy = Total shells brought back by boys
10 × 60 = 600 shells

Step 3: Calculate the total number of shells brought back by the girls.
Total shells brought back by boys + (4 × Total shells brought back by boys) = Total shells brought back by girls
600 + (4 × 600) = 600 + 2,400 = 3,000 shells

Step 4: Calculate the number of shells brought back by each girl.
Total
