To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator and then find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load of the elevator.

Given information:
- The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg.
- An adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator.
Total weight = Weight of Jack + Weight of the 8 other adults
Total weight = 80 kg + (8 Ã— 80 kg)
Total weight = 80 kg + 640 kg
Total weight = 720 kg

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the total weight and the maximum load of the elevator.
Difference = Total weight - Maximum load
Difference = 720 kg - 700 kg
Difference = 20 kg

Therefore, the people in the elevator will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

Final answer: The people in the elevator will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.
