Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On the first day, Darren did:
  - 100 pushups
  - 50 squats
  - 20 dumbbell presses
- On the second day, Darren did:
  - 20 more pushups than on the first day
  - 10 fewer squats than on the first day
  - Doubled the number of dumbbell presses

Step 1: Calculate the number of activities Darren did on the second day.
Pushups on the second day = 100 + 20 = 120
Squats on the second day = 50 - 10 = 40
Dumbbell presses on the second day = 20 Ã— 2 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the total count of the activities Darren did in the two days.
Total pushups = 100 + 120 = 220
Total squats = 50 + 40 = 90
Total dumbbell presses = 20 + 40 =
