To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the infection over time.

Given information:
- Initially, 10 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to find the number of people infected after 3 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the number of people infected on the first day.
Initial number of infected people = 10
Each infected person infects 6 others
Number of people infected on the first day = 10 × 6 = 60

Step 2: Calculate the number of people infected on the second day.
Number of people infected on the second day = (10 + 60) × 6 = 420

Step 3: Calculate the number of people infected on the third day.
Number of people infected on the third day = (10 + 60 + 420) × 6 = 2,940

Therefore, the total number of people infected after 3 days is:
10 (initial infected people) + 60 (infected on the first day) + 420
