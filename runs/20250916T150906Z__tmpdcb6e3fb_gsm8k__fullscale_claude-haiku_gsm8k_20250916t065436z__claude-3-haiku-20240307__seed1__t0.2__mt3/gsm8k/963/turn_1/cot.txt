Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Together, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
- Then, Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokemon.
- And, Alex has caught 4x - 8 Pokemon.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for x:
Total Pokemon caught = Adelwolfe's Pokemon + Stan's Pokemon + Alex's Pokemon
339 = x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8)
339 = 9x - 21
360 = 9x
x = 40

So, Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon.

Now, we can find the number of Pokemon Stan has caught:
Stan's Pokemon = 4x - 13
Stan's Pokemon = 4
