To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.

Given information:
- Together, Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe.
- Let y be the number of Pokemon caught by Stan.
- Let z be the number of Pokemon caught by Alex.

Step 1: Set up the equations based on the given information.
Equation 1: Total number of Pokemon caught = 339
x + y + z = 339

Equation 2: Alex has caught 5 more than Stan
z = y + 5

Equation 3: Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught
y = 4x - 13

Step 2: Substitute the expressions from Equations 2 an
