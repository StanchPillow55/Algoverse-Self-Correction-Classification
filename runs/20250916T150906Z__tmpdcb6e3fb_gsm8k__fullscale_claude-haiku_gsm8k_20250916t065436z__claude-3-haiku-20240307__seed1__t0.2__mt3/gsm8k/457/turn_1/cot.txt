Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.

2. After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing fairies.
   * Katelyn saw 50 fairies initially.
   * Half of 50 is 25.
   * So, 25 more fairies joined the existing 50 fairies.
   * The total number of fairies is now 50 + 25 = 75.

3. 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.
   * The total number of fairies was 75.
   * 30 fairies flew away.
   * The remaining number of fairies is 75 - 30 = 45.

Therefore, the final answer is 45 fairies remaining.
