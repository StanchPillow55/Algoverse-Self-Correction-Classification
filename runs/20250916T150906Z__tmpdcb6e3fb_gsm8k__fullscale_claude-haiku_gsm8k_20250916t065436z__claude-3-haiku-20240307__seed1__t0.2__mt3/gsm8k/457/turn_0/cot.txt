To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies flying above the nearby forest.
- After 20 minutes, one of Katelyn's friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east and join the existing fairies.
- 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fairies that joined the existing ones.
Half of the initial number of fairies seen by Katelyn = 50 รท 2 = 25 fairies
Total number of fairies after the additional 25 joined = 50 + 25 = 75 fairies

Step 2: Calculate the number of fairies that flew away 10 minutes later.
Number of fairies that flew away = 30

Step 3: Calculate the number of fairies remaining.
Number of fairies remaining = Total number of fairies after the additional 25 joined - Number of fairies that flew away
Number of fairies remaining = 75 - 30 =
