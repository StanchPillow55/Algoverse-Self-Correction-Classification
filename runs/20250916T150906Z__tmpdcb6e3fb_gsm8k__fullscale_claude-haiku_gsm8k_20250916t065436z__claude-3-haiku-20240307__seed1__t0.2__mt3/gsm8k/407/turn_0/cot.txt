To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of steps Elliott took during his jog.

Given information:
- Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.
- He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school.
- He did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.
- After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take.

Step 1: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had completed before his jog.
Steps completed on walks to and from school = 10,000 ÷ 2 = 5,000 steps
Steps completed on the short walk with his friend = 1,000 steps
Total steps completed before the jog = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps

Step 2: Calculate the number of steps Elliott had left to take after his jog.
Steps left to take = 2,000 steps

Step 3: Calculate the total number of steps Elliott took during his jog.
Total steps taken during the jog = Total steps goal - Steps completed before the j
