To solve this problem, we need to find the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car and then use that information to calculate the maximum distance she can drive on a single tank of gas.

Given information:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank.
- She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up the tank again.
- The owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car.
Fuel efficiency = Distance traveled / Amount of fuel used
Fuel efficiency = 100 miles / 4 gallons
Fuel efficiency = 25 miles per gallon (mpg)

Step 2: Calculate the maximum distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.
Maximum distance = Fuel tank capacity × Fuel efficiency
Maximum distance = 12 gallons × 25 miles per gallon
Maximum distance = 300 miles

Therefore, Sophia can drive up to 300 miles on a single tank of gas.

Final answer: Sophia can drive up to 300 miles on a single tank of gas.
