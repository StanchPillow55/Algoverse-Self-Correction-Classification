Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
- He has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.
- This month has 30 days.

Daily call with boss = 15 minutes
Total days in the month = 30 days
Total minutes used for calls with boss = 15 minutes Ã— 30 days = 450 minutes

Total minutes in the phone plan = 1000 minutes
Remaining minutes = Total minutes in the phone plan - Total
