To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of minutes Jason has used and then subtract it from the total number of minutes in his plan.

Given information:
- Jason has a phone plan of 1000 minutes per month.
- He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
- He has had 300 extra minutes of calls to other people this month.
- This month has 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes used for the calls with his boss.
Number of days in a month × Duration of each call = Total minutes used for calls with boss
30 days × 15 minutes = 450 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes used for the extra calls to other people.
Extra minutes used = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes used.
Total minutes used = Minutes used for calls with boss + Extra minutes used
Total minutes used = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes

Step 4: Calculate the number of minutes left in Jason's plan.
Total minutes in the plan - Total minutes used = Minutes left in the plan
