To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left to find the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with.

Given information:
- Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
- Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house.
- Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house.
- Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

Step 1: Find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had after selling at the orange house.
Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house, so the number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house is twice the number of vacuum cleaners she has left, which is 5.
Number of vacuum cleaners left after the orange house = 5 Ã— 2 = 10

Step 2: Find the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had after selling at the red house.
Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, so the number of vacuum cleaners left after the red house is 10 + 2 =
