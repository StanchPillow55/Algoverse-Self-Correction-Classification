Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.

2. Her son gets 4 cookies in his lunch box 5 days a week.
   * 4 cookies x 5 days = 20 cookies per week

3. Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
   * 1 cookie x 7 days = 7 cookies per week

4. To find how many cookies Jenny eats, we need to subtract the cookies her son and husband eat from the total cookies in the bag.
   * Total cookies in the bag: 36
   * Cookies her son eats: 20
   * Cookies her husband eats: 7
   * Cookies Jenny eats: 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 cookies per week

Therefore, the final answer is that Jenny eats 9 cookies per week.
