Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies a week, and each bag has 36 cookies.
- Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week.
- Jenny's husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days.
- Jenny eats the rest of the cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Jenny's son eats in a week.
Cookies per day × Number of days = Total cookies for son
4 cookies × 5 days = 20 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Jenny's husband eats in a week.
Cookies per day × Number of days = Total cookies for husband
1 cookie × 7 days = 7 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cookies used by Jenny's son and husband in a week.
Total cookies for son + Total cookies for husband = Total cookies used by son and husband
20 cookies + 7 cookies = 27 cookies

Step 4: Calculate the number of cookies left in the bag for Jenny
