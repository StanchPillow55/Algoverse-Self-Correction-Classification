Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Erica is 30 years old.

Step 1: Find Beth's age.
Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Beth's age as:
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5 = 35 years old

Step 2: Find Alice's age.
Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age as:
Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7 = 42 years old

Step 3: Find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.
Difference in age = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference in age = 42 - 30 = 12 years

Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.
