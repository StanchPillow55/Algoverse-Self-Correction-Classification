Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days.
* Total distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km x 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
* Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* 30% of 800 km = 0.3 x 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
* Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km + 240 km = 1,040 km

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the second week.
* Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for the second week.
* Total distance traveled in the second week = 300 km x 7 days = 2,100 km

Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip.
* Total distance
