Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day.
- Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
- On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all.
- During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km × 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next two days.
Distance traveled in the next two days = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 × 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
Total distance traveled in the first week = Distance traveled in the first 4 days + Distance traveled in the next two days
Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km +
