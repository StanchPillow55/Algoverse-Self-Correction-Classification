Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tom traveled for 2 weeks (14 days)
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day
- Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days
- On the next day, he didn't travel at all
- During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 4 days × 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 × 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the day he didn't travel.
Distance traveled on the day he didn't travel = 0 kilometers

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the second week.
Distance traveled during the second week = 7
