Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Will buys 15 oranges.
- Will asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old.
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest.

Step 1: Find the age of the youngest son.
Youngest son's age = 1/2 × Oldest son's age
Youngest son's age = 1/2 × 8 = 4 years old

Step 2: Calculate the number of oranges washed by the sons.
Oldest son washes = 8 oranges
Youngest son washes = 4 oranges
Total oranges washed by the sons = 8 + 4 = 12 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the number of oranges left unwashed.
Total oranges bought - Total oranges washed = Oranges left unwashed
15 - 12 = 3 oranges

Therefore, the final answer is that 3 oranges are left unwashed.
