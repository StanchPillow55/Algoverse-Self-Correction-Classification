Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours over the weekend.
- She spends 3 hours reading.
- She spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining time after reading.
Total time - Time spent reading = Remaining time
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time spent playing video games.
Remaining time × 1/3 = Time spent playing video games
9 hours × 1/3 = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time spent playing soccer.
Remaining time - Time spent playing video games = Time spent playing soccer
9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours

Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer.
(Time spent playing soccer / Total time) × 100 = Percentage of weekend spent playing soccer
(6 hours / 12 hours) × 100 = 50
