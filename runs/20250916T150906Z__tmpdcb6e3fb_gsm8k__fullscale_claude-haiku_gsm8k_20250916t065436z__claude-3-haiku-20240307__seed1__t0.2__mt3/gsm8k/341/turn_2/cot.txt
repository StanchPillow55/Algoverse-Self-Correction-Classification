Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pink frog weighs 50 pounds.
- The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad.
- The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake.
- The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
- The container weighs 20 pounds.

Step 1: Find the weight of the blue beetle and the green toad.
Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, we know that:
Blue beetle weight = Green toad weight = 50 pounds

Step 2: Find the weight of the yellow snake.
The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake, so:
Yellow snake weight = 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds

Step 3: Find the weight of the red bird.
The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird, so:
Red bird weight = 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds
