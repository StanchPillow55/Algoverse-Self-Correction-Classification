Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Joey played 2 matches on Monday.
- Joey played 1 match on Friday.
- On Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of matches Joey played on Saturday.
Matches played on Saturday = 2 × Matches played on Monday
Matches played on Saturday = 2 × 2 = 4 matches

Step 2: Calculate the total number of matches Joey played in one week.
Total matches played = Matches played on Monday + Matches played on Friday + Matches played on Saturday
Total matches played = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches

Therefore, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

Final answer: Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.
