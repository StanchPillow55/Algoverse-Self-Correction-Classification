Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
- In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.
- In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
- In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of chocolate produced in the second week.
Amount produced in the second week = 1/2 × 8,000 = 4,000 bars

Step 2: Calculate the amount of chocolate produced in the third week.
Amount produced in the third week = 3 × 8,000 = 24,000 bars

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolate produced in the first three weeks.
Total amount produced in the first three weeks = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars

Step 4: Calculate the amount of chocolate that needs to be produced in the fourth week to reach the monthly target of 50,000 bars.
