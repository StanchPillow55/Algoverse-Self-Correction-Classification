Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `get_positive` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the original list.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension. List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list by applying a transformation or condition to each element of an existing list.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Define the function `get_positive` that takes a list `l` as input.
   - Use a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `l`.
   - For each element in the list, check if the number is positive (greater than or equal to 0).
   - If the number is positive, include it in the new list.
   - Return the new list containing only the positive numbers.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1]
    """
    return [num for num in l if num >= 0]
```

Explanation:

1. The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input, which is annotated with the type hint `list`.
2. Inside the function, we use a list comprehension to create a new list. The list comprehension iterates through each element `num` in the input list `l`.
3. For each `num` in the list, we check if the number is greater than or equal to 0 using the condition `num >= 0`. This ensures that only positive numbers (including 0) are included in the new list.
4. The resulting list containing only the positive numbers is returned by the function.

The provided docstring includes two example usages of the `get_positive` function, which demonstrate the expected behavior.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `get_positive` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the positive numbers from the input list.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a list comprehension to filter out the positive numbers from the input list. This approach is efficient and concise.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """
    return [num for num in l if num > 0]
```

Explanation:

- The function `get_positive` takes a list `l` as input.
- We use a list comprehension to iterate through each number `num` in the input list `l`.
- For each `num`, we check if it is greater than 0 (i.e., positive) using the condition `num > 0`.
- The numbers that satisfy the condition are included in the new list, which is then returned as the output.

This approach is efficient because it avoids the need for a separate loop or conditional statement to filter the positive numbers. The list comprehension performs the filtering in a concise and readable manner.
