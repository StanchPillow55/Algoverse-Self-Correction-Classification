Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem describes a scenario where there are `n` cars driving left to right and another `n` cars driving right to left on an infinitely long straight road. The cars move at the same speed, and when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left, they are said to have collided. However, the cars are infinitely sturdy, so they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. The function `car_race_collision(n)` should output the number of such collisions.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a mathematical approach. Let's consider the relative positions of the cars on the road.

   - Since the cars are moving at the same speed, the relative speed between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left is twice the speed of a single car.
   - The cars will collide when the distance between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left is equal to the sum of their lengths.
   - The number of collisions will be the number of pairs of cars that satisfy this condition.

3. **Implementing the Solution**: To implement the solution, we can use the following steps:

   a. Assume that the cars have a length of 1 unit.
   b. The relative speed between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left is 2 units per unit of time.
   c. The distance between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left is the sum of their lengths, which is 2 units.
   d. The time it takes for the cars to collide is the distance between them divided by their relative speed, which is 1 unit of time.
   e. In 1 unit of time, the cars will have traveled 1 unit of distance each, so the distance between the cars will be 2 units.
   f. Therefore, the number of collisions will be the number of pairs of cars that are 2 units apart at any given time.
   g. Since there are `n` cars moving left to right and `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of pairs of cars is `n * n`.
   h. The number of pairs of cars that are 2 units apart at any given time is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, as each car can collide with `n - 1` other cars.

Implementation:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between cars moving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.

    Returns:
        int: The number of collisions.
    """
    return n * (n - 1) // 2
```

Explanation:

1. The function `car_race_collision(n)` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars moving in each direction (left to right and right to left).
2. The formula `n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the number of pairs of cars that can collide. This is because each car can collide with `n - 1` other cars, and we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting the collisions (i.e., if car A collides with car B, we don't need to count the collision between car B and car A).
3. The `//` operator performs integer division, which ensures that the result is an integer.
4. The function returns the calculated number of collisions.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1), as the calculation can be done in constant time, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional memory.

Since the cars are moving at the same speed, the relative speed between a car moving left to right and a car moving right to left is twice the speed of a single car. This means that the time it takes for a collision to occur is inversely proportional to the relative speed.

3. **Calculation**: Let's consider the cars in the left-to-right direction and the cars in the right-to-left direction as two separate sets. The first car in the left-to-right set will collide with the last car in the right-to-left set, the second car in the left-to-right set will collide with the second-to-last car in the right-to-left set, and so on. The number of collisions will be the sum of the indices of the cars in the right-to-left set, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

   ```
   Number of collisions = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1
   Number of collisions = n * (n + 1) / 2
   ```

    """
    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2

Explanation:

- The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars moving in each direction.
- The formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the indices of the cars in the right-to-left set, which represents the number of collisions.

- The function returns the calculated number of collisions.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the number of collisions between cars driving in opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of cars driving in each direction.

    return (n * (n + 1)) // 2

Explanation:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars driving in each direction (left to right and right to left).
2. The formula `n * (n + 1) / 2` calculates the sum of the indices of the cars in the right-to-left set, which represents the number of collisions.
3. The result is then returned as an integer.

This solution has a time complexity of O(1) since it uses a mathematical formula to calculate the number of collisions, which is independent of the value of `n`.
