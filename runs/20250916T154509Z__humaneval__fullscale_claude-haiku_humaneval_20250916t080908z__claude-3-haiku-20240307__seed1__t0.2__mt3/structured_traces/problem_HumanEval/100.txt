Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem asks us to create a function `make_a_pile(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list of the number of stones in each level of a pile. The first level has `n` stones, and the number of stones in the next level is either the next odd number (if `n` is odd) or the next even number (if `n` is even).

2. **Identifying the key steps**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   - Determine the number of stones in the first level, which is simply `n`.
   - Determine the number of stones in the subsequent levels based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - Append the number of stones in each level to a list and return the list.

3. **Implementing the solution**:

   a. **Determining the number of stones in each level**:
      - If `n` is odd, the number of stones in the next level will be `n + 2`.
      - If `n` is even, the number of stones in the next level will be `n + 1`.
      - We can use a loop to generate the number of stones in each level until we reach the desired number of levels.

   b. **Appending the number of stones to a list**:
      - We can create an empty list and append the number of stones in each level to it.
      - The list will be returned as the final result.

Implementation:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    stones_per_level = []
    current_stones = n

    # Add the number of stones in the first level
    stones_per_level.append(current_stones)

    # Determine the number of stones in the subsequent levels
    while len(stones_per_level) < n:
        if current_stones % 2 == 0:  # n is even
            current_stones += 1
        else:  # n is odd
            current_stones += 2
        stones_per_level.append(current_stones)

    return stones_per_level
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize an empty list `stones_per_level` to store the number of stones in each level.
2. We set the initial value of `current_stones` to `n`, which represents the number of stones in the first level.
3. We add the number of stones in the first level to the `stones_per_level` list.
4. We then enter a loop that continues until the length of the `stones_per_level` list is equal to `n`, which means we have determined the number of stones in all `n` levels.
5. Inside the loop, we check if the current number of stones (`current_stones`) is even or odd. If it's even, we add 1 to get the next even number. If it's odd, we add 2 to get the next odd number.
6. We then append the updated `current_stones` value to the `stones_per_level` list.
7. Finally, we return the `stones_per_level` list, which contains the number of stones in each level.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), as we need to iterate through the levels to determine the number of stones in each one. The space complexity is also O(n), as we need to store the number of stones in each level in the `stones_per_level` list.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to create a function `make_a_pile(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list of the number of stones in each level of a pile, where the first level has `n` stones, and the number of stones in the next level is either the next odd number (if `n` is odd) or the next even number (if `n` is even).

2. **Identifying the Pattern**: From the examples provided, we can observe the following pattern:
   - If `n` is odd, the number of stones in each level follows an odd number sequence: `n`, `n+2`, `n+4`, and so on.
   - If `n` is even, the number of stones in each level follows an even number sequence: `n`, `n+2`, `n+4`, and so on.

3. **Developing the Algorithm**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Initialize an empty list to store the number of stones in each level.
   b. Add the initial number of stones (`n`) to the list.
   c. Determine the next number of stones based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   d. Repeat step (c) until the desired number of levels is reached.
   e. Return the list of stone counts.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    stones = []
    stones.append(n)  # Add the initial number of stones

    while len(stones) < n:
        if n % 2 == 0:  # n is even
            stones.append(stones[-1] + 2)
        else:  # n is odd
            stones.append(stones[-1] + 2)

    return stones
```

Explanation:

1. We start by initializing an empty list `stones` to store the number of stones in each level.
2. We add the initial number of stones (`n`) to the `stones` list.
3. We then enter a loop that continues until the length of the `stones` list is equal to `n`, which means we have the desired number of levels.
4. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, we add the next even number (`stones[-1] + 2`) to the `stones` list. If `n` is odd, we add the next odd number (`stones[-1] + 2`) to the `stones` list.
5. Finally, we return the `stones` list, which contains the number of stones in each level.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), as we need to iterate through the desired number of levels to build the list of stone counts.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to create a function `make_a_pile(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a list of the number of stones in each level of a pile, where the first level has `n` stones, and the number of stones in the next level is either the next odd number (if `n` is odd) or the next even number (if `n` is even).

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good starting point to understand the problem and develop a solution.
   - Example 1: `make_a_pile(3)` should return `[3, 5, 7]`. The first level has 3 stones, the second level has 5 stones (the next odd number), and the third level has 7 stones (the next odd number).

3. **Identifying the Pattern**: Based on the examples, we can observe the following pattern:
   - If `n` is odd, the number of stones in the next level is the next odd number, which can be calculated as `n + 2`.
   - If `n` is even, the number of stones in the next level is the next even number, which can be calculated as `n + 1`.

4. **Developing the Solution**: To implement the `make_a_pile(n)` function, we can follow these steps:
   a. Initialize an empty list to store the number of stones in each level.
   b. Add the initial `n` stones to the first level.
   c. Iterate from the second level to the `n`-th level, calculating the number of stones in each level based on the pattern observed.
   d. Append the calculated number of stones to the list.
   e. Return the list of stones in each level.

Implementation:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    """
    stones = [n]  # Add the initial n stones to the first level
    for i in range(1, n):
        if n % 2 == 0:  # If n is even, the next level has the next even number
            stones.append(n + i)
        else:  # If n is odd, the next level has the next odd number
            stones.append(n + i + 1)
    return stones
```

Explanation:

1. We start by initializing an empty list `stones` and adding the initial `n` stones to the first level.
2. We then iterate from the second level to the `n`-th level using a `for` loop.
3. Inside the loop, we check if `n` is even or odd using the modulo operator `%`. If `n` is even, we add the next even number (`n + i`) to the `stones` list. If `n` is odd, we add the next odd number (`n + i + 1`) to the `stones` list.
4. Finally, we return the `stones` list, which contains the number of stones in each level.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), as we iterate through the levels from 1 to `n`. The space complexity is also O(n), as we store the number of stones in each level in the `stones` list.
