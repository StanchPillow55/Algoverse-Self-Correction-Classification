Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `is_simple_power(x, n)` should return `True` if the number `x` is a simple power of `n`, and `False` otherwise. A number `x` is considered a simple power of `n` if there exists an integer `int` such that `n**int = x`.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if `n` is equal to 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, which would make `x` a simple power of `n`.
   b. Check if `x` is equal to 1, as 1 is a simple power of any number.
   c. If neither of the above conditions is met, we can try to find an integer `int` such that `n**int = x`. If such an integer is found, then `x` is a simple power of `n`.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """
    Returns True if a number x is a simple power of n, and False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if n is equal to 1
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1

    # Check if x is equal to 1
    if x == 1:
        return True

    # Try to find an integer int such that n**int = x
    int = 0
    while n ** int <= x:
        if n ** int == x:
            return True
        int += 1

    return False
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Check if `n` is equal to 1**: If `n` is equal to 1, then any number `x` raised to the power of 0 (which is 1) would be a simple power of `n`. Therefore, we return `True` if `x` is equal to 1, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Check if `x` is equal to 1**: If `x` is equal to 1, then it is a simple power of any number `n`, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Therefore, we return `True` in this case.

3. **Find an integer `int` such that `n**int = x`**: If neither of the above conditions is met, we start with `int = 0` and keep incrementing it until `n**int` is greater than `x`. If at any point, `n**int` is equal to `x`, then `x` is a simple power of `n`, and we return `True`. If we exhaust all possible values of `int` without finding a match, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether `x` is a simple power of `n` or not.

2. **Analyzing the examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - `is_simple_power(1, 4) => True`: 1 is a simple power of 4 (4^0 = 1).
   - `is_simple_power(2, 2) => True`: 2 is a simple power of 2 (2^1 = 2).
   - `is_simple_power(8, 2) => True`: 8 is a simple power of 2 (2^3 = 8).
   - `is_simple_power(3, 2) => False`: 3 is not a simple power of 2.
   - `is_simple_power(3, 1) => False`: 3 is not a simple power of 1.
   - `is_simple_power(5, 3) => False`: 5 is not a simple power of 3.

3. **Approach**: To determine if a number `x` is a simple power of `n`, we can use the following steps:
   - Check if `n` is equal to 1. If so, return `False` because 1 is not a simple power of any number.
   - Check if `x` is equal to 1. If so, return `True` because 1 is a simple power of any number (1^0 = 1).
   - Iterate through the possible exponents, starting from 0, and check if `n` raised to the power of the current exponent is equal to `x`. If a match is found, return `True`.
   - If no match is found after iterating through all possible exponents, return `False`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """
    Returns True if a number x is a simple power of n, and False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if n is equal to 1, which is not a simple power of any number
    if n == 1:
        return False
    
    # Check if x is equal to 1, which is a simple power of any number
    if x == 1:
        return True
    
    # Iterate through possible exponents and check if n^exponent == x
    exponent = 0
    while True:
        power = n ** exponent
        if power == x:
            return True
        elif power > x:
            return False
        exponent += 1
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if `n` is equal to 1. If so, we return `False` because 1 is not a simple power of any number.
2. We then check if `x` is equal to 1. If so, we return `True` because 1 is a simple power of any number (1^0 = 1).
3. We initialize an `exponent` variable to 0 and enter a loop.
4. Inside the loop, we calculate the power of `n` raised to the current `exponent` and compare it to `x`.
   - If the power is equal to `x`, we return `True` because we have found a simple power.
   - If the power is greater than `x`, we return `False` because we have exhausted all possible exponents and haven't found a match.
   - If the power is less than `x`, we increment the `exponent` and continue the loop.

This implementation covers all the cases provided in the examples and should correctly determine whether a number `x` is a simple power of `n`.

   - Repeatedly divide `x` by `n` and increment `int` until `x` becomes 1.
   - If `x` becomes 1 after the division, it means `x` is a simple power of `n`, so we return `True`.
   - If `x` never becomes 1, it means `x` is not a simple power of `n`, so we return `False`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """
    Returns True if a number x is a simple power of n, and False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if n is equal to 1, in which case x cannot be a simple power of n
    if n == 1:
        return False

    # Initialize the exponent variable
    int = 0

    # Repeatedly divide x by n and increment the exponent until x becomes 1
    while x > 1:
        if x % n != 0:
            return False
        x //= n
        int += 1

    # If x becomes 1, it means it is a simple power of n
    return True
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if `n` is equal to 1. If so, we return `False` because 1 is not a simple power of any number.
2. We initialize a variable `int` to 0, which will store the exponent of the simple power.
3. We enter a loop that repeatedly divides `x` by `n` and increments `int` until `x` becomes 1.
4. Inside the loop, we check if `x` is divisible by `n`. If not, we return `False` because `x` is not a simple power of `n`.
5. If `x` is divisible by `n`, we divide `x` by `n` and increment `int`.
6. After the loop, if `x` has become 1, it means `x` is a simple power of `n`, so we return `True`.
7. If `x` never becomes 1, it means `x` is not a simple power of `n`, so we return `False`.

This implementation covers all the provided examples and should work for any input values of `x` and `n`.
