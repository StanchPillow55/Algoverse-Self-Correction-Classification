Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `string_sequence(n: int) -> str` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
   b. Use a loop to iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   c. For each iteration, convert the current number to a string and append it to the result string, separated by a space.
   d. Return the final result string.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """
    Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to n inclusive.

    Args:
        n (int): The upper bound of the sequence.

    Returns:
        str: A string containing the sequence of numbers.

    Examples:
        >>> string_sequence(0)
        '0'
        >>> string_sequence(5)
        '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    result = ""
    for i in range(n + 1):
        result += str(i)
        if i < n:
            result += " "
    return result
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define the function `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string.
2. Inside the function, we initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.
3. We use a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using the `range(n + 1)` function.
4. For each iteration, we convert the current number `i` to a string using `str(i)` and append it to the `result` string.
5. If the current number `i` is not the last number in the sequence (i.e., `i < n`), we append a space character `" "` to the `result` string to separate the numbers.
6. Finally, we return the `result` string.

The function handles the two example cases provided:

- For `string_sequence(0)`, the output is `'0'`.
- For `string_sequence(5)`, the output is `'0 1 2 3 4 5'`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), as we need to iterate through the numbers from 0 to `n` and append each number to the result string. The space complexity is O(n) as well, as the length of the output string grows linearly with the input `n`.
