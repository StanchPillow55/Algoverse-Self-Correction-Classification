Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `is_prime(n)` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Defining Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.

3. **Approach**: To determine whether a number `n` is prime, we can follow these steps:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime, so we return `False`.
   - If `n` is 2 or 3, it is prime, so we return `True`.
   - If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime, so we return `False`.
   - For all other numbers, we can check if `n` is divisible by any number between 5 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime, so we return `False`.
   - If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers between 5 and the square root of `n`, it is prime, so we return `True`.

4. **Optimization**: We can further optimize the solution by skipping the numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3, as they are not prime. This will reduce the number of checks we need to perform.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    
    return True
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 1. If so, we return `False` because 1 is not a prime number, and numbers less than or equal to 1 are also not prime.

2. Next, we check if `n` is 2 or 3. If so, we return `True` because 2 and 3 are the only even prime numbers.

3. We then check if `n` is divisible by 2 or 3. If so, we return `False` because any number divisible by 2 or 3 is not prime.

4. For all other numbers, we start a loop that checks if `n` is divisible by any number between 5 and the square root of `n` (inclusive). We use a step size of 6 to skip the numbers that are divisible by 2 or 3, as they are not prime.

5. If `n` is divisible by any of the numbers in the loop, we return `False`.

6. If `n` is not divisible by any of the numbers in the loop, we return `True`, as it is a prime number.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(âˆšn), which is efficient for most practical purposes.
