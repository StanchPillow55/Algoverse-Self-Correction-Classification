Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function that takes two integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. **Approach**: To find the GCD of two integers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is a efficient way to find the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm works as follows:

   - If `b` is 0, then `a` is the GCD.
   - Otherwise, the GCD of `a` and `b` is the same as the GCD of `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

3. **Implementation**: We can implement the Euclidean algorithm in Python using a recursive function.

   - The base case is when `b` is 0, in which case we return `a`.
   - In the recursive case, we call the function with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b.
    
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`.
2. The function checks if `b` is 0. If it is, the function returns `a`, as the GCD of `a` and 0 is `a`.
3. If `b` is not 0, the function recursively calls itself with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. This is the core of the Euclidean algorithm.
4. The function continues to call itself recursively until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the final GCD.

The time complexity of this implementation is O(log(min(a, b))), as the number of recursive calls is proportional to the number of digits in the smaller of the two input numbers.

The provided test cases demonstrate the correct behavior of the function:

- `greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)` returns `1`, which is the GCD of 3 and 5.
- `greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)` returns `5`, which is the GCD of 25 and 15.
