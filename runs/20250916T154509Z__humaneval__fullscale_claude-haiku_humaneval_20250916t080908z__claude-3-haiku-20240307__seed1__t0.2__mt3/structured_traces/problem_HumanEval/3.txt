Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function that takes a list of integers representing deposit and withdrawal operations on a bank account, and determines whether the balance of the account ever falls below zero.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of operations and keep track of the current balance of the account. If the balance ever becomes negative, we can return `True` to indicate that the account balance fell below zero. If we reach the end of the list without encountering a negative balance, we can return `False`.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Initialize the current balance to 0.
   - Iterate through the list of operations:
     - For each operation, update the current balance by adding the value of the operation.
     - If the current balance becomes negative, return `True`.
   - If we reach the end of the list without returning `True`, return `False`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether the balance of a bank account ever falls below zero.

    Args:
        operations (List[int]): A list of deposit and withdrawal operations on the bank account.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the balance of the account falls below zero, False otherwise.
    """
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define the function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers `operations` as input.
2. We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, which represents the starting balance of the account.
3. We iterate through the `operations` list using a `for` loop.
4. For each operation, we update the `balance` by adding the value of the operation.
5. If the `balance` becomes negative (i.e., `balance < 0`), we immediately return `True` to indicate that the account balance fell below zero.
6. If we reach the end of the `operations` list without returning `True`, we return `False` to indicate that the account balance never fell below zero.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `operations` list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once.

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(below_zero([1, 2, 3]))  # False
print(below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5]))  # True
```

The output will be:

```
False
True
```

The function correctly identifies that the first list of operations does not result in the account balance falling below zero, while the second list does.
