Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `is_multiply_prime(a)` should return `True` if the given number `a` is the multiplication of three prime numbers, and `False` otherwise. We also know that `a` is less than 100.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the given number `a` is less than 100 (as per the problem statement).
   b. Iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `a` (inclusive) to find the prime factors of `a`.
   c. If we find exactly three prime factors, check if their multiplication is equal to `a`.
   d. If the multiplication of the three prime factors is equal to `a`, return `True`, otherwise, return `False`.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
import math

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """
    Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less then 100.
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5
    """
    # Check if the given number is less than 100
    if a < 100:
        # Initialize a list to store the prime factors
        prime_factors = []
        # Iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of a (inclusive)
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(a)) + 1):
            # Check if the current number is a prime factor of a
            if a % i == 0:
                # If it is, check if it is a prime number
                if all(i % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(i)) + 1)):
                    prime_factors.append(i)
                    # If we have found three prime factors, check if their multiplication is equal to a
                    if len(prime_factors) == 3 and prime_factors[0] * prime_factors[1] * prime_factors[2] == a:
                        return True
        # If we couldn't find three prime factors, return False
        return False
    else:
        return False
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We first check if the given number `a` is less than 100, as per the problem statement.
2. If `a` is less than 100, we initialize an empty list `prime_factors` to store the prime factors of `a`.
3. We then iterate through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `a` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
4. For each number `i` in the loop, we check if it is a prime factor of `a` by checking if `a` is divisible by `i`.
5. If `i` is a prime factor of `a`, we check if `i` is a prime number by checking if all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `i` (inclusive) are not divisors of `i`.
6. If `i` is a prime number, we add it to the `prime_factors` list.
7. If the `prime_factors` list has exactly three elements, we check if their multiplication is equal to `a`. If it is, we return `True`.
8. If we couldn't find three prime factors, we return `False`.
9. If `a` is not less than 100, we return `False` as per the problem statement.

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(a)), as we are iterating through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of `a` (inclusive) to find the prime factors.

        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Check if the given number is less than 100**: We start by checking if the given number `a` is less than 100, as per the problem statement. If it's not, we return `False` immediately.

2. **Find all the prime factors of the given number**: To find the prime factors of `a`, we iterate through the numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive). For each number, we check if it divides `a` without a remainder. If it does, we add it to the `prime_factors` list and divide `a` by that number. We continue this process until `a` becomes 1.

3. **Check if the number of prime factors is exactly 3**: After finding all the prime factors, we check if the length of the `prime_factors` list is exactly 3. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that the given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies whether the given number is the multiplication of three prime numbers or not, as long as the number is less than 100.

    return False
```

Explanation:

1. We define a helper function `is_prime(n)` to check if a given number `n` is prime. This function checks if `n` is less than 2 (in which case it returns `False`), and then iterates through all numbers from 2 to the square root of `n`, checking if any of them divide `n` evenly. If no such number is found, the function returns `True`.

2. In the `is_multiply_prime(a)` function, we first check if the input `a` is greater than or equal to 100, in which case we return `False` (as per the problem statement).

3. We then find all prime numbers less than the square root of `a` using a list comprehension and the `is_prime` helper function.

4. We iterate through all possible combinations of three prime numbers from the list of primes found in the previous step. For each combination, we check if the product of the three prime numbers is equal to `a`. If such a combination is found, we return `True`.

5. If no such combination is found, we return `False`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the square root of the input `a`, as we are iterating through all possible combinations of three prime numbers. However, since the input `a` is guaranteed to be less than 100, the actual running time of the function will be relatively small.
