Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function that takes a decimal number as input and converts it to a binary representation. The binary representation should be returned as a string, with each character representing a binary digit ('0' or '1'). Additionally, the string should have the characters 'db' at the beginning and the end of the string.

2. **Approach**: To convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the following steps:
   - Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation.
   - Repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and append the remainder (0 or 1) to the string.
   - Reverse the string to get the correct binary representation.
   - Add the 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function decimal_to_binary(decimal):
       binary_string = ""
       while decimal > 0:
           remainder = decimal % 2
           binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string
           decimal = decimal // 2
       return "db" + binary_string + "db"
   ```

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """You will be given a number in decimal form and your task is to convert it to
    binary format. The function should return a string, with each character representing a binary
    number. Each character in the string will be '0' or '1'.

    There will be an extra couple of characters 'db' at the beginning and at the end of the string.

    Examples:
    decimal_to_binary(15)   # returns "db1111db"
    decimal_to_binary(32)   # returns "db100000db"
    """
    binary_string = ""
    while decimal > 0:
        remainder = decimal % 2
        binary_string = str(remainder) + binary_string
        decimal = decimal // 2
    return "db" + binary_string + "db"
```

Explanation:

1. We start by initializing an empty string `binary_string` to store the binary representation.
2. We then enter a `while` loop that continues as long as the `decimal` value is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, we perform the following steps:
   - Calculate the remainder of the `decimal` number when divided by 2 and store it in the `remainder` variable.
   - Append the `remainder` (which will be either '0' or '1') to the beginning of the `binary_string`.
   - Update the `decimal` value by integer division by 2 (`//=` operator).
4. After the loop, the `binary_string` will contain the binary representation of the input `decimal` number.
5. Finally, we return the `binary_string` with the 'db' characters added at the beginning and end to match the required format.

This solution has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the input decimal number, as the number of iterations in the `while` loop is proportional to the number of bits in the binary representation of the decimal number.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `decimal_to_binary` that takes a decimal number as input and returns a string representation of the binary equivalent of that number. The string should have the format "db[binary_representation]db", where the "db" characters are added at the beginning and end of the binary representation.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected input and output format:
   - `decimal_to_binary(15)` should return "db1111db"
   - `decimal_to_binary(32)` should return "db100000db"

3. **Identifying the Conversion Process**: To convert a decimal number to binary, we can use the following steps:
   - Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly.
   - Record the remainders of each division, starting from the last division.
   - The binary representation is the sequence of these remainders, with the last remainder being the least significant bit.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Based on the understanding of the problem and the conversion process, we can write the `decimal_to_binary` function as follows:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """
    Converts a decimal number to its binary representation as a string.

    Args:
        decimal (int): The decimal number to be converted.

    Returns:
        str: The binary representation of the decimal number, with "db" at the beginning and end.
    """
    # Convert the decimal number to binary
    binary_digits = []
    while decimal > 0:
        remainder = decimal % 2
        binary_digits.append(str(remainder))
        decimal //= 2

    # Reverse the binary digits to get the correct order
    binary_representation = "".join(reversed(binary_digits))

    # Add the "db" prefix and suffix
    return f"db{binary_representation}db"
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We initialize an empty list `binary_digits` to store the binary digits.
2. We use a `while` loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and append the remainder (0 or 1) to the `binary_digits` list.
3. After the loop, we reverse the `binary_digits` list to get the correct order of the binary representation.
4. We then join the binary digits into a single string and add the "db" prefix and suffix to the result.

This solution should work for the given examples and handle any positive integer input.
