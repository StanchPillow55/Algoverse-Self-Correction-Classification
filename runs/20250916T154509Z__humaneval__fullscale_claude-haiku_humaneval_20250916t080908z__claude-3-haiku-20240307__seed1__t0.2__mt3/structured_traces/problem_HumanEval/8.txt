Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sum and the product of all the integers in the list.

2. **Edge Cases**: The problem statement mentions that for an empty list, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1. We need to handle this edge case in our implementation.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the running sum and product. We can use a loop to iterate through the list and update the sum and product variables accordingly.

4. **Handling the Edge Case**: For the edge case of an empty list, we can simply return the tuple `(0, 1)` as specified in the problem statement.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning process:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """
    For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.

    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    # Handle the edge case of an empty list
    if not numbers:
        return 0, 1

    # Initialize the sum and product variables
    total_sum = 0
    total_product = 1

    # Iterate through the list and update the sum and product
    for num in numbers:
        total_sum += num
        total_product *= num

    # Return the tuple of sum and product
    return total_sum, total_product
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function takes a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns a tuple of two integers, representing the sum and the product of the numbers in the list.

2. The first `if` statement checks if the input list is empty. If it is, the function returns the tuple `(0, 1)` as specified in the problem statement.

3. If the list is not empty, the function initializes two variables, `total_sum` and `total_product`, to keep track of the running sum and product, respectively.

4. The function then iterates through the list of numbers using a `for` loop. In each iteration, it updates the `total_sum` by adding the current number, and updates the `total_product` by multiplying it with the current number.

5. Finally, the function returns the tuple `(total_sum, total_product)`, which represents the sum and product of all the numbers in the input list.

This implementation handles the edge case of an empty list and correctly computes the sum and product of the numbers in the list.
