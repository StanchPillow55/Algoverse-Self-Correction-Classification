Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The function `is_sorted` takes a list of numbers as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. Additionally, if the list has more than one duplicate of the same number, the function should return `False`.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Check if the list has only one element, in which case it is considered sorted.
   - Iterate through the list and compare each element with the next element.
   - If the current element is greater than the next element, the list is not sorted, and we can return `False`.
   - If we encounter more than one duplicate of the same number, we can also return `False`.
   - If we reach the end of the list without encountering any issues, we can return `True`.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    """
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True

    # Keep track of the previous element
    prev_element = lst[0]

    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        # If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element,
        # or if we encounter more than one duplicate, return False
        if lst[i] <= prev_element or lst.count(lst[i]) > 1:
            return False
        prev_element = lst[i]

    # If we reach this point, the list is sorted
    return True
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if the list has only one element. If so, we return `True` because a list with a single element is considered sorted.

2. We initialize a variable `prev_element` to keep track of the previous element in the list.

3. We then iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, we check two conditions:
   - If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, the list is not sorted, so we return `False`.
   - If the count of the current element in the list is greater than 1, the list has more than one duplicate, so we return `False`.

4. If we reach the end of the list without encountering any issues, we return `True` because the list is sorted.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the `prev_element` variable.

2. **Analyzing the examples**: The examples provided give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - `is_sorted([5]) ➞ True`: A single-element list is considered sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ True`: A list with numbers in ascending order is considered sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) ➞ False`: A list with numbers not in ascending order is considered not sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) ➞ True`: A list with no duplicates and in ascending order is considered sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ True`: A list with no duplicates and in ascending order is considered sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ False`: A list with numbers not in ascending order is considered not sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]) ➞ True`: A list with duplicates, but in ascending order, is considered sorted.
   - `is_sorted([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ False`: A list with more than one duplicate is considered not sorted.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Iterate through the list and check if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - Keep track of the count of each number in the list using a dictionary.
   - If any number has a count greater than 1, return `False`.
   - If the list is sorted and there are no duplicates, return `True`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    """
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True

    # Keep track of the count of each number in the list
    num_count = {}

    # Iterate through the list and check if it's sorted
    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        # If the current number is less than the previous number, return False
        if lst[i] < lst[i-1]:
            return False

        # Update the count of the current number
        num_count[lst[i]] = num_count.get(lst[i], 0) + 1

        # If any number has a count greater than 1, return False
        if num_count[lst[i]] > 1:
            return False

    # If the list is sorted and there are no duplicates, return True
    return True
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the list has only one element, in which case it is considered sorted.
2. We create a dictionary `num_count` to keep track of the count of each number in the list.
3. We iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 1) and check if the current number is less than the previous number. If so, we return `False` because the list is not sorted.
4. We update the count of the current number in the `num_count` dictionary. If any number has a count greater than 1, we return `False` because the list has more than one duplicate.
5. If the list is sorted and there are no duplicates, we return `True`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `is_sorted` takes a list of numbers as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. Additionally, if the list contains more than one duplicate of the same number, the function should return `False`.

2. **Identifying the Constraints**: The problem statement mentions that the list will only contain non-negative integers, and there will be no negative numbers.

3. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples cover various scenarios, including:
   - A list with a single element (which should be considered sorted)
   - A list with numbers in ascending order
   - A list with numbers not in ascending order
   - A list with duplicate numbers (where the duplicates should not exceed one)
   - A list with duplicate numbers (where the duplicates exceed one)

4. **Developing the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the list has only one element, in which case it is considered sorted.
   b. Iterate through the list, comparing each element with the next element.
   c. If the current element is greater than the next element, the list is not sorted, and we can return `False`.
   d. If the current element is equal to the next element, we need to check if there are more than one duplicate. We can do this by keeping track of the count of each number in the list.
   e. If the count of any number exceeds 1, we return `False`.
   f. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the list is sorted, and we return `True`.

Implementation:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    """
    Given a list of numbers, return whether or not they are sorted
    in ascending order. If list has more than 1 duplicate of the same
    number, return False. Assume no negative numbers and only integers.
    """
    # Check if the list has only one element
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return True

    # Keep track of the count of each number in the list
    num_count = {}

    # Iterate through the list, comparing each element with the next
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        # If the current element is greater than the next, the list is not sorted
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False

        # Update the count of the current number
        num_count[lst[i]] = num_count.get(lst[i], 0) + 1

        # If the count of any number exceeds 1, the list has more than one duplicate
        if num_count[lst[i]] > 1:
            return False

    # Update the count of the last element
    num_count[lst[-1]] = num_count.get(lst[-1], 0) + 1

    # If the loop completes without returning False, the list is sorted
    return True
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the list has only one element, in which case it is considered sorted, and we return `True`.
2. We create a dictionary `num_count` to keep track of the count of each number in the list.
3. We iterate through the list, comparing each element with the next element. If the current element is greater than the next, the list is not sorted, and we return `False`.
4. For each element, we update the count of that number in the `num_count` dictionary. If the count of any number exceeds 1, the list has more than one duplicate, and we return `False`.
5. After the loop, we update the count of the last element in the `num_count` dictionary.
6. If the loop completes without returning `False`, the list is sorted, and we return `True`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the list once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number in the list.
