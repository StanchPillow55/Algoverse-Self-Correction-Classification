Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `starts_one_ends` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We will iterate through all the possible `n`-digit positive integers and check if the first or last digit is 1. We will keep a running count of the numbers that satisfy this condition and return the final count.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   a. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
   b. Iterate through all the possible `n`-digit positive integers, starting from 1 and ending at 10^n - 1.
   c. For each number, check if the first or last digit is 1. If so, increment the `count` variable.
   d. Return the final value of `count`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem statement does not mention any specific edge cases, but we should still consider the case where `n` is 1, as the range of 1-digit positive integers is different from the range of `n`-digit positive integers.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    count = 0
    if n == 1:
        # For 1-digit positive integers, the numbers that start or end with 1 are 1 and 10.
        return 2
    else:
        # Iterate through all the possible n-digit positive integers.
        for num in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):
            # Check if the first or last digit is 1.
            if str(num)[0] == '1' or str(num)[-1] == '1':
                count += 1
        return count
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function `starts_one_ends` takes a positive integer `n` as input.
2. We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
3. We handle the edge case where `n` is 1. In this case, the numbers that start or end with 1 are 1 and 10, so we return 2.
4. For `n` greater than 1, we iterate through all the possible `n`-digit positive integers, starting from 10^(n-1) and ending at 10^n - 1.
5. For each number, we check if the first or last digit is 1. We do this by converting the number to a string and checking the first and last characters.
6. If the first or last digit is 1, we increment the `count` variable.
7. Finally, we return the final value of `count`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(10^n), as we iterate through all the possible `n`-digit positive integers. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `starts_one_ends` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

2. **Identifying the Constraints**: The problem statement mentions that the input `n` is a positive integer, which means it will be a whole number greater than 0.

3. **Generating Examples**: Let's start by generating some examples to understand the problem better:
   - For `n = 1`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The count is 11.
   - For `n = 2`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 91, 81, 71, 61, 51, 41, 31, 21. The count is 18.
   - For `n = 3`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 191, 181, 171, 161, 151, 141, 131, 121, 911, 811, 711, 611, 511, 411, 311, 211. The count is 36.

4. **Identifying the Pattern**: Based on the examples, we can observe the following pattern:
   - For `n = 1`, the count is 11.
   - For `n = 2`, the count is 18.
   - For `n = 3`, the count is 36.
   - The count seems to be increasing by 7 for each increment in `n`.

5. **Developing the Solution**: We can use this pattern to develop a formula to calculate the count for any given `n`. The formula would be:
   - For `n = 1`, the count is 11.
   - For `n > 1`, the count is 11 + 7 * (n - 1).

6. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 11
    else:
        return 11 + 7 * (n - 1)
```

Explanation:

1. The function first checks if the input `n` is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns 11, as per the pattern observed in the examples.
2. If `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates the count using the formula `11 + 7 * (n - 1)`, which is based on the observed pattern.

This solution covers all the cases and provides the correct count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

   - For `n = 1`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. The count is 11.
   - For `n = 2`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99. The count is 19.
   - For `n = 3`, the numbers that start or end with 1 are: 100, 101, 102, 103, ..., 199, 910, 911, 912, ..., 999. The count is 190.

4. **Identifying the Pattern**: Based on the examples, we can observe the following pattern:
   - For `n = 1`, the count is 11.
   - For `n = 2`, the count is 19.
   - For `n = 3`, the count is 190.
   - The count seems to be increasing exponentially as `n` increases.

5. **Developing the Solution**: To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
   - For `n = 1`, the count is 11 (1 to 9, 10, 11).
   - For `n = 2`, the count is 19 (10 to 19, 91 to 99).
   - For `n = 3`, the count is 190 (100 to 199, 910 to 999).
   - We can generalize this pattern by observing that the count for `n`-digit numbers is the sum of the count for `(n-1)`-digit numbers and the count for `(n-1)`-digit numbers starting with 1.

Implementing the Solution:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 11
    else:
        return 10 + starts_one_ends(n - 1)
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. The base case is when `n` is 1, in which case the function returns 11, as we have observed in the examples.
2. For `n` greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself with `n - 1` and adds 10 to the result.
   - The 10 represents the numbers from 10 to 19, which are the `(n-1)`-digit numbers that end with 1.
   - The recursive call to `starts_one_ends(n - 1)` gives us the count of `(n-1)`-digit numbers that start with 1.
3. By adding these two values, we get the total count of `n`-digit numbers that start or end with 1.

This recursive approach allows us to efficiently calculate the count for any given value of `n`, as we can build upon the previous results.
