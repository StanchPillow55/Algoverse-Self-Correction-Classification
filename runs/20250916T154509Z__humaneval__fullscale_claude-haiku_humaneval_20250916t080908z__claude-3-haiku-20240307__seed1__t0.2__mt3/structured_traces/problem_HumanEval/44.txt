Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `change_base` that takes an integer `x` and a base `base` (less than 10) as input, and returns the string representation of `x` in the specified base.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
   - Convert the input number `x` to its decimal representation.
   - Repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base and store the remainders.
   - Construct the string representation of the number in the target base by concatenating the remainders in reverse order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   - If the input base is less than 2 or greater than 9, we should raise a `ValueError`.
   - If the input number `x` is negative, we should raise a `ValueError`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    """Change numerical base of input number x to base.
    return string representation after the conversion.
    base numbers are less than 10.
    >>> change_base(8, 3)
    '22'
    >>> change_base(8, 2)
    '1000'
    >>> change_base(7, 2)
    '111'
    """
    # Check for invalid base
    if base < 2 or base > 9:
        raise ValueError("Base must be between 2 and 9 (inclusive)")

    # Check for negative input
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input number must be non-negative")

    # Convert to decimal
    decimal = x

    # Convert to target base
    result = ""
    while decimal > 0:
        remainder = decimal % base
        result = str(remainder) + result
        decimal //= base

    # Handle the case when the input is 0
    if not result:
        result = "0"

    return result
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if the input base is valid (between 2 and 9, inclusive). If not, we raise a `ValueError`.
2. We also check if the input number `x` is negative. If so, we raise a `ValueError`.
3. We convert the input number `x` to its decimal representation and store it in the `decimal` variable.
4. We then repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base and store the remainders. We construct the string representation of the number in the target base by concatenating the remainders in reverse order.
5. If the input number is 0, we return the string "0" as the result.
