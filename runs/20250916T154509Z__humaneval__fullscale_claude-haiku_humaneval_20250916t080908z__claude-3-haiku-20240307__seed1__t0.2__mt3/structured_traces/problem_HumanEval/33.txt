Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `sort_third` takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list `l'` that satisfies the following conditions:
   - The values at the indices that are not divisible by three (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, etc.) remain the same as in the original list `l`.
   - The values at the indices that are divisible by three (i.e., 3, 6, 9, etc.) are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Identify the indices that are divisible by three in the input list `l`.
   - Extract the values at those indices and sort them.
   - Create a new list `l'` with the same length as `l`.
   - Populate `l'` with the values from `l`, but replace the values at the indices divisible by three with the sorted values.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    """
    # Create a new list l' with the same length as l
    l_prime = [0] * len(l)

    # Extract the values at the indices divisible by three and sort them
    divisible_by_three = sorted([l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0])

    # Populate l' with the values from l, replacing the values at the indices divisible by three with the sorted values
    j = 0
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_prime[i] = divisible_by_three[j]
            j += 1
        else:
            l_prime[i] = l[i]

    return l_prime
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We create a new list `l_prime` with the same length as the input list `l`, filled with zeros.
2. We extract the values at the indices divisible by three from `l` and sort them in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
3. We then iterate through the input list `l` and populate the corresponding indices in `l_prime`:
   - If the current index `i` is divisible by three, we assign the next value from the sorted `divisible_by_three` list to `l_prime[i]`.
   - If the current index `i` is not divisible by three, we simply assign the value from the original list `l` to `l_prime[i]`.
4. Finally, we return the modified list `l_prime`.

The provided examples demonstrate the expected behavior of the `sort_third` function:

- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the function returns `[1, 2, 3]`, as there are no indices divisible by three.
- For the input `[5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]`, the function returns `[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]`, where the values at the indices divisible by three (3 and 6) are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:
   - Identify the indices that are divisible by three.
   - Extract the values at those indices and sort them.
   - Create a new list `l'` by replacing the values at the divisible-by-three indices with the sorted values.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

    # Create a new list to store the result
    l_prime = l.copy()

    # Extract the values at indices divisible by three and sort them
    divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]
    divisible_by_three.sort()

    # Replace the values at divisible-by-three indices with the sorted values
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            l_prime[i] = divisible_by_three.pop(0)

    return l_prime
```

Explanation:

1. We create a copy of the input list `l` using `l.copy()` to avoid modifying the original list.
2. We extract the values at indices divisible by three using a list comprehension `[l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 3 == 0]` and sort them using the `sort()` method.
3. We iterate through the list `l_prime` and replace the values at indices divisible by three with the sorted values from the `divisible_by_three` list. We use `pop(0)` to remove and return the first element from the `divisible_by_three` list.
4. Finally, we return the modified list `l_prime`.

The provided examples are correctly handled by this implementation:

```python
>>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
[1, 2, 3]
>>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
[2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

The key aspects of this solution are:
- Identifying the indices that are divisible by three.
- Extracting the values at those indices and sorting them.
- Replacing the values at the divisible-by-three indices in the new list with the sorted values.

This approach ensures that the function correctly modifies the list as per the problem statement.

   - The values at indices that are not divisible by three (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, etc.) remain the same as in the original list `l`.
   - The values at indices that are divisible by three (i.e., 3, 6, 9, etc.) are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:
   - Identify the indices that are divisible by three.
   - Extract the values at those indices and sort them.
   - Create a new list `l'` by replacing the values at the divisible-by-three indices with the sorted values, while keeping the other values the same as in the original list `l`.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

    # Create a new list to store the result
    result = []

    # Iterate through the original list
    for i, value in enumerate(l):
        # If the index is divisible by three, add the sorted value to the result list
        if i % 3 == 0:
            result.append(value)
        # Otherwise, add the original value to the result list
        else:
            result.append(l[i])

    # Sort the values at the indices divisible by three
    result[::3] = sorted(result[::3])

    return result
```

Explanation:

1. We create a new list `result` to store the final output.
2. We iterate through the original list `l` using `enumerate()` to get both the index and the value.
3. If the index `i` is divisible by three (i.e., `i % 3 == 0`), we add the value to the `result` list.
4. If the index `i` is not divisible by three, we add the original value from `l` to the `result` list.
5. After the loop, we sort the values at the indices divisible by three using the slice notation `result[::3]`.
6. Finally, we return the `result` list.

The provided examples are correctly handled by this implementation:

```python
print(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
```

The key aspects of this solution are:

1. Identifying the indices that are divisible by three and extracting the values at those indices.
2. Sorting the extracted values and replacing them in the result list.
3. Preserving the values at the indices that are not divisible by three.

This approach ensures that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.
