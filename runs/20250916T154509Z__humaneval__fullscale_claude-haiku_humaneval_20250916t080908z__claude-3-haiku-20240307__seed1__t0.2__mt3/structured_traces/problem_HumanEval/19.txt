Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function that takes a space-delimited string of numberals (from 'zero' to 'nine') as input and returns the string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest.

2. **Identifying the Input and Output**: The input is a string of space-delimited numberals, and the output is a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest.

3. **Handling the Input**: We need to first split the input string into individual words (numberals) and then convert each word to its corresponding integer value. This will allow us to sort the numbers.

4. **Sorting the Numbers**: Once we have the integer values, we can sort them in ascending order.

5. **Constructing the Output**: After sorting the numbers, we need to convert the integer values back to their corresponding word representations and then join them back into a single string.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    """
    Input is a space-delimited string of numberals from 'zero' to 'nine'.
    Valid choices are 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight' and 'nine'.
    Return the string with numbers sorted from smallest to largest.

    >>> sort_numbers('three one five')
    'one three five'
    """
    # Define a dictionary to map numberals to their integer values
    numeral_to_int = {
        'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,
        'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9
    }

    # Split the input string into individual words (numberals)
    numberals = numbers.split()

    # Convert the numberals to their corresponding integer values
    int_values = [numeral_to_int[numeral] for numeral in numberals]

    # Sort the integer values in ascending order
    int_values.sort()

    # Convert the sorted integer values back to their corresponding numeral representations
    sorted_numberals = [list(numeral_to_int.keys())[list(numeral_to_int.values()).index(value)] for value in int_values]

    # Join the sorted numberals back into a single string
    sorted_numbers = ' '.join(sorted_numberals)

    return sorted_numbers
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define a dictionary `numeral_to_int` that maps each numeral (from 'zero' to 'nine') to its corresponding integer value.

2. We split the input string `numbers` into a list of individual words (numberals) using the `split()` method.

3. We convert the numberals to their corresponding integer values using a list comprehension and the `numeral_to_int` dictionary.

4. We sort the integer values in ascending order using the `sort()` method.

5. We convert the sorted integer values back to their corresponding numeral representations using another list comprehension. We first find the key (numeral) for each value in the `numeral_to_int` dictionary using the `index()` method, and then use that key to retrieve the corresponding numeral.

6. Finally, we join the sorted numberals back into a single string using the `join()` method with a space character as the separator.

The `sort_numbers()` function takes a string of space-delimited numberals as input and returns the string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest.
