Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to create a function called `any_int` that takes three numbers as input and returns `True` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

2. **Identifying the Inputs and Outputs**: The function takes three numbers as input (`x`, `y`, and `z`) and returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Check if all three input numbers are integers.
   b. Check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number.
   c. Return `True` if both conditions are met, and `False` otherwise.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    '''
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    
    Examples
    any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False

    any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True
    
    any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False
    '''
    # Check if all three inputs are integers
    if not isinstance(x, int) or not isinstance(y, int) or not isinstance(z, int):
        return False

    # Check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number
    if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function first checks if all three input numbers (`x`, `y`, and `z`) are integers using the `isinstance()` function. If any of the inputs are not integers, the function returns `False`.

2. Next, the function checks if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. It does this by checking the following conditions:
   - `x + y == z`
   - `x + z == y`
   - `y + z == x`

3. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.

4. If none of the conditions are met, the function returns `False`.

This implementation covers all the requirements specified in the problem statement and handles the provided examples correctly.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `any_int` takes three numbers as input and returns `True` if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples provided give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - `any_int(5, 2, 7) ➞ True`: One of the numbers (7) is equal to the sum of the other two (5 + 2).
   - `any_int(3, 2, 2) ➞ False`: None of the numbers are equal to the sum of the other two.
   - `any_int(3, -2, 1) ➞ True`: One of the numbers (1) is equal to the sum of the other two (3 + -2).
   - `any_int(3.6, -2.2, 2) ➞ False`: At least one of the numbers (3.6, -2.2) is not an integer.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Check if all three numbers are integers.
   b. Calculate the sum of each pair of numbers.
   c. Check if any of the sums are equal to the third number.
   d. Return `True` if the condition is met, `False` otherwise.

Implementation:

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    """
    Create a function that takes 3 numbers.
    Returns true if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
    Returns false in any other cases.
    """
    # Check if all numbers are integers
    if not all(isinstance(num, int) for num in (x, y, z)):
        return False

    # Calculate the sums of each pair of numbers
    sum_xy = x + y
    sum_xz = x + z
    sum_yz = y + z

    # Check if any of the sums are equal to the third number
    return sum_xy == z or sum_xz == y or sum_yz == x
```

Explanation:

1. The function first checks if all three input numbers are integers using the `all()` function and the `isinstance()` function. If any of the numbers are not integers, the function returns `False`.
2. Next, the function calculates the sum of each pair of numbers: `sum_xy`, `sum_xz`, and `sum_yz`.
3. Finally, the function checks if any of the sums are equal to the third number. If so, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This solution covers all the cases provided in the examples and should work for any valid input.

```

Explanation:

1. The function `any_int` takes three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. We first check if all three numbers are integers using the `all()` function and the `isinstance()` function. If any of the numbers are not integers, we return `False`.
3. We then calculate the sums of each pair of numbers: `sum_xy`, `sum_xz`, and `sum_yz`.
4. Finally, we check if any of the sums are equal to the third number. If so, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This solution covers all the cases provided in the examples and ensures that the function returns the correct result based on the given requirements.
