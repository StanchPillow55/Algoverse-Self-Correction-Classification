Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `sum_squares` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squared numbers in the list. However, before squaring the numbers, we need to round each element in the list to the upper integer (ceiling).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the input list.
   b. For each element in the list, round it up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil()` function.
   c. Square the rounded number.
   d. Add the squared number to the running sum.
   e. Return the final sum.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem statement provides several examples, including cases where the input list contains negative numbers and floating-point numbers. We need to ensure our solution handles these cases correctly.

Implementation:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    You are given a list of numbers.
    You need to return the sum of squared numbers in the given list,
    round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling) first.
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 14
    For lst = [1,4,9] the output should be 98
    For lst = [1,3,5,7] the output should be 84
    For lst = [1.4,4.2,0] the output should be 29
    For lst = [-2.4,1,1] the output should be 6
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        # Round the number up to the nearest integer
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        # Square the rounded number and add it to the running sum
        total_sum += rounded_num ** 2
    return total_sum
```

Explanation:

1. We import the `math` module to use the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
2. The `sum_squares` function takes a list of numbers as input.
3. We initialize a variable `total_sum` to keep track of the running sum of the squared numbers.
4. We iterate through the input list `lst` using a `for` loop.
5. For each number in the list, we round it up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil(num)`.
6. We then square the rounded number and add it to the `total_sum`.
7. Finally, we return the `total_sum`.

This solution handles all the examples provided in the problem statement, including cases with negative numbers and floating-point numbers.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - For `[1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `14` (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14).
   - For `[1, 4, 9]`, the output should be `98` (1^2 + 4^2 + 9^2 = 1 + 16 + 81 = 98).
   - For `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, the output should be `84` (1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 84).
   - For `[1.4, 4.2, 0]`, the output should be `29` (2^2 + 5^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 25 + 0 = 29).
   - For `[-2.4, 1, 1]`, the output should be `6` ((-2)^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6).

3. **Identifying the Steps**: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the input list.
   b. For each element, round it up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil()` function.
   c. Square the rounded number.
   d. Add the squared number to the running sum.
   e. Return the final sum.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: Here's the Python function that implements the solution:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    Returns the sum of squared numbers in the given list, rounding each element to the upper integer (ceiling) first.
    """
    total_sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        squared_num = rounded_num ** 2
        total_sum += squared_num
    return total_sum
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We import the `math` module to use the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
2. The `sum_squares` function takes a list `lst` as input.
3. We initialize a variable `total_sum` to keep track of the running sum.
4. We iterate through each element `num` in the input list `lst`.
5. For each `num`, we round it up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil(num)` and store the result in `rounded_num`.
6. We then square the `rounded_num` and add it to the `total_sum`.
7. Finally, we return the `total_sum`.

This solution covers all the examples provided and should work for any input list of numbers.

3. **Identifying the Steps**: Based on the problem statement and the examples, we can identify the following steps to solve the problem:
   a. Round each element in the input list to the upper integer (ceiling).
   b. Square each rounded number.
   c. Sum up all the squared numbers.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: We can use the following Python function to solve the problem:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    Returns the sum of squared numbers in the given list, after rounding each element to the upper integer (ceiling).
    """
    squared_sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        rounded_num = math.ceil(num)
        squared_num = rounded_num ** 2
        squared_sum += squared_num
    return squared_sum
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

- We import the `math` module to use the `math.ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- We initialize a variable `squared_sum` to keep track of the sum of the squared numbers.
- We iterate through the input list `lst`.
- For each number in the list, we round it up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil()` and store the result in `rounded_num`.
- We then square the `rounded_num` and add it to the `squared_sum` variable.
- Finally, we return the `squared_sum`.

This function should work for all the provided examples and handle both positive and negative numbers, as well as decimal numbers.
