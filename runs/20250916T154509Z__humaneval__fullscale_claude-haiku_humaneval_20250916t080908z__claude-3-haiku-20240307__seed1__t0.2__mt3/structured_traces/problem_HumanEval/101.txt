Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `words_string(s)` that takes a string `s` as input, which contains words separated by commas or spaces, and returns an array of those words.

2. **Identifying the Input and Output**: The input to the function is a string `s`, which contains words separated by commas or spaces. The output should be a list of those words.

3. **Identifying the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
   - Split the input string `s` into a list of words using the appropriate separator (comma or space).
   - Return the resulting list of words.

4. **Implementing the Solution**: To implement the solution, we can use the built-in `split()` method in Python. The `split()` method allows us to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator. In this case, we can use either a comma (`,`) or a space (`' '`) as the separator.

   Here's the complete function definition:

   ```python
   def words_string(s):
       """
       You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
       to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
       
       For example:
       words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
       words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
       """
       # Split the input string using either comma or space as the separator
       words = s.split(', ') if ',' in s else s.split()
       return words
   ```

Explanation of the Solution:

1. The function `words_string(s)` takes a string `s` as input, which contains words separated by commas or spaces.

2. Inside the function, we use the `split()` method to split the input string `s` into a list of words. The `split()` method takes an optional argument, which is the separator character(s) to use for the split.

3. We first check if the input string `s` contains a comma (`,`) using the `in` operator. If it does, we split the string using the separator `', '` (comma followed by a space). This ensures that we correctly handle cases where the words are separated by commas and spaces.

4. If the input string `s` does not contain a comma, we simply split the string using the default separator, which is a single space character (`' '`).

5. The resulting list of words is then returned by the function.

This solution handles both cases where the words are separated by commas or spaces, and it returns the list of words as required by the problem statement.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `words_string(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a list of words. The string can be separated by commas or spaces.

2. **Identifying the Input and Output**: The input is a string `s`, and the output is a list of words.

3. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples provided give us a good understanding of the expected behavior of the function:
   - Example 1: `words_string("Hi, my name is John")` should return `["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]`.
   - Example 2: `words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six")` should return `["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]`.

4. **Identifying the Approach**: Based on the problem statement and the examples, we can see that the main task is to split the input string into individual words. We can use Python's built-in string methods to achieve this.

Approach:

1. **Split the Input String**: We can use the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of words. The `split()` method can take an optional argument to specify the separator character(s). In this case, we can use a comma or a space as the separator.

2. **Handle Multiple Separators**: Since the problem statement mentions that the string can be separated by either commas or spaces, we need to handle both cases. We can use the `split()` method twice, first with a comma as the separator, and then with a space as the separator, and return the union of the two lists.

3. **Return the List of Words**: Finally, we can return the list of words.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces. Your task is
    to split the string into words and return an array of the words.
    
    For example:
    words_string("Hi, my name is John") == ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
    words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six") == ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
    """
    # Split the string by comma
    words_by_comma = s.split(",")
    
    # Split the string by space
    words_by_space = s.split()
    
    # Combine the two lists and remove any empty strings
    words = list(set(words_by_comma + words_by_space))
    words = [word.strip() for word in words if word.strip()]
    
    return words
```

Explanation:

1. We first split the input string `s` by comma using the `split(",")` method and store the resulting list in `words_by_comma`.
2. We then split the input string `s` by space using the `split()` method (without any arguments) and store the resulting list in `words_by_space`.
3. We combine the two lists `words_by_comma` and `words_by_space` using the `+` operator, and then convert the result to a set to remove any duplicate words.
4. We then convert the set back to a list and use a list comprehension to remove any empty strings (by checking if the stripped word is not empty).
5. Finally, we return the resulting list of words.

This solution handles both comma-separated and space-separated strings, and it ensures that the output list contains unique words without any empty strings.

    # Remove any empty strings from the list
    words = [word for word in words if word]
    
    return words
```

Explanation:

1. The `split()` method is used twice to split the input string `s` using both commas and spaces as separators. The resulting lists are then concatenated using the `+` operator.
2. The list comprehension `[word for word in words if word]` is used to remove any empty strings from the list of words.
3. The final list of words is returned as the output of the function.

This solution should work for the given examples and handle any input string with words separated by commas or spaces.
