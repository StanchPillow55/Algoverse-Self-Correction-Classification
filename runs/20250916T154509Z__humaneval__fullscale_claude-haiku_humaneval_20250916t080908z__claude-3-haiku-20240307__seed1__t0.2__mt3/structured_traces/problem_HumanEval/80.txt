Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function `is_happy(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if the string is "happy," and `False` otherwise. A string is considered "happy" if it meets the following criteria:
   - The length of the string is at least 3.
   - Every 3 consecutive letters in the string are distinct.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the string and check if every 3 consecutive letters are distinct. We can do this by using a sliding window approach, where we maintain a window of 3 characters and check if they are all distinct.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Check if the length of the string is less than 3. If so, return `False` because the string cannot be "happy."
   - Iterate through the string, starting from the 0th index and ending at the (length - 2)th index.
   - For each iteration, extract a substring of length 3 starting from the current index.
   - Check if the characters in the substring are all distinct.
   - If they are not distinct, return `False`.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, return `True`.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def is_happy(s):
    """
    Checks if the given string is "happy" or not.
    A string is "happy" if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.
    
    Args:
        s (str): The input string to be checked.
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if the string is "happy", False otherwise.
    """
    # Check if the length of the string is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the string, checking every 3 consecutive letters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        substring = s[i:i+3]
        if len(set(substring)) != 3:
            return False
    
    # If the loop completes without returning False, the string is "happy"
    return True
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if the length of the input string `s` is less than 3. If it is, we immediately return `False` because the string cannot be "happy" (it needs to have at least 3 characters).
2. We then iterate through the string, starting from the 0th index and ending at the (length - 2)th index. This ensures that we can always extract a substring of length 3 without going out of bounds.
3. For each iteration, we extract a substring of length 3 starting from the current index using the slice notation `s[i:i+3]`.
4. We then check if the length of the set of characters in the substring is equal to 3, which means that all 3 characters are distinct. If the length is not 3, it means that at least one character is repeated, and we return `False`.
5. If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that all 3-character substrings in the string are distinct, and we return `True`.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to iterate through the entire string once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the substring and the set of characters.
