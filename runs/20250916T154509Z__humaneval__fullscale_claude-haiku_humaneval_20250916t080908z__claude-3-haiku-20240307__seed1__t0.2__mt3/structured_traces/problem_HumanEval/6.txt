Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The input to the function is a string that represents multiple groups of nested parentheses, separated by spaces. The output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the deepest level of nesting for the corresponding group of parentheses.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through each group of parentheses and keep track of the current level of nesting. We can use a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses, and the maximum depth of the stack will represent the deepest level of nesting.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Initialize an empty list to store the results.
   - Split the input string by spaces to get the individual groups.
   - Iterate through each group:
     - Initialize a stack to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses.
     - Iterate through each character in the group:
       - If the character is an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
       - If the character is a closing parenthesis, pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack.
     - The maximum depth of the stack represents the deepest level of nesting for the current group.
     - Append the maximum depth to the result list.
   - Return the result list.

4. **Implementation**:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """
    Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    result = []
    groups = paren_string.split()

    for group in groups:
        stack = []
        max_depth = 0

        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(char)
            elif char == ')':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()

            max_depth = max(max_depth, len(stack))

        result.append(max_depth)

    return result
```

Explanation of the implementation:

1. We initialize an empty list `result` to store the deepest level of nesting for each group.
2. We split the input string `paren_string` by spaces to get the individual groups.
3. For each group, we initialize an empty stack `stack` to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses.
4. We also initialize a variable `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth of the stack, which represents the deepest level of nesting.
5. We iterate through each character in the current group:
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis `(`, we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis `)`, we pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack (if the stack is not empty).
   - We update the `max_depth` variable to be the maximum of the current `max_depth` and the length of the `stack`.
6. After processing the current group, we append the `max_depth` to the `result` list.
7. Finally, we return the `result` list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string, as we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), as the maximum size of the stack can be the length of the longest group of nested parentheses.
