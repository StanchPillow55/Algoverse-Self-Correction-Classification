Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement asks us to write a function `incr_list` that takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list with each element incremented by 1.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple loop to iterate through the input list and create a new list with the incremented values.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   - Create an empty list to store the incremented values.
   - Iterate through the input list.
   - For each element in the input list, increment it by 1 and append it to the new list.
   - Return the new list.

4. **Implementation**:

Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning behind each step:

```python
def incr_list(l: list) -> list:
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    # Create an empty list to store the incremented values
    new_list = []

    # Iterate through the input list
    for element in l:
        # Increment each element by 1 and append it to the new list
        new_list.append(element + 1)

    # Return the new list
    return new_list
```

Explanation:

1. The function signature `def incr_list(l: list) -> list:` indicates that the function takes a list `l` as input and returns a new list.

2. The docstring provides a brief description of the function's purpose and includes two example usages with their expected outputs.

3. Inside the function, we create an empty list `new_list` to store the incremented values.

4. We then iterate through the input list `l` using a `for` loop, where `element` represents each element in the list.

5. For each `element`, we increment it by 1 and append the result to the `new_list` using the `append()` method.

6. Finally, we return the `new_list` containing the incremented values.

This implementation follows the pseudocode outlined earlier and provides a straightforward solution to the problem. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once.
