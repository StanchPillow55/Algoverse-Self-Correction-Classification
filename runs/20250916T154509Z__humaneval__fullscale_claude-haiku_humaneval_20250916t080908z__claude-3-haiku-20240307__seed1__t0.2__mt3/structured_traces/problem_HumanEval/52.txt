Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `below_threshold` that takes a list `l` and a threshold `t` as input, and returns `True` if all the numbers in the list are below the given threshold, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the list and check if each number is less than the given threshold. If any number is greater than or equal to the threshold, we can immediately return `False`. If we finish iterating through the entire list without finding any number greater than or equal to the threshold, we can return `True`.

3. **Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function below_threshold(l, t):
       for each number in l:
           if number >= t:
               return False
       return True
   ```

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def below_threshold(l: list, t: int) -> bool:
    """Return True if all numbers in the list l are below threshold t.
    >>> below_threshold([1, 2, 4, 10], 100)
    True
    >>> below_threshold([1, 20, 4, 10], 5)
    False
    """
    for num in l:
        if num >= t:
            return False
    return True
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The function takes two parameters: `l` (a list of numbers) and `t` (the threshold value).
2. We use a `for` loop to iterate through each number `num` in the list `l`.
3. Inside the loop, we check if the current number `num` is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`. If this condition is true, it means we have found a number that is not below the threshold, so we immediately return `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any number greater than or equal to the threshold, it means all numbers in the list are below the threshold, so we return `True`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list `l`, as we need to iterate through the entire list once.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.
