Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function `triangle_area` that takes two parameters, `a` (the length of a side of the triangle) and `h` (the height or high of the triangle), and returns the area of the triangle.

2. **Identifying the Formula**: The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is:

   ```
   Area = (1/2) * base * height
   ```

   In this case, the base is represented by the parameter `a`, and the height is represented by the parameter `h`.

3. **Implementing the Solution**: To implement the solution, we can use the formula to calculate the area and return the result.

Complete Function Definition:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
```

Explanation:

1. The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` (the length of a side of the triangle) and `h` (the height or high of the triangle).
2. Inside the function, we calculate the area using the formula `Area = (1/2) * base * height`, where `base` is represented by `a` and `height` is represented by `h`.
3. The calculated area is stored in the variable `area`.
4. Finally, the function returns the calculated area.

The docstring provided with the function includes a simple example usage, which demonstrates that the function correctly calculates the area of a triangle with a side length of 5 and a height of 3, returning the expected result of 7.5.
