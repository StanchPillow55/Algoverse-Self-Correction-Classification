Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to write a function called `filter_integers` that takes a list of any Python values (`List[Any]`) and returns a list of only the integer values (`List[int]`).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can iterate through the input list and check if each element is an instance of the `int` type. If the element is an integer, we can add it to the output list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: We should consider edge cases, such as when the input list is empty or contains only non-integer values.

4. **Efficiency**: We want to ensure that the solution is efficient, as it may need to process large lists.

5. **Readability and Maintainability**: The code should be easy to understand and maintain.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition with the reasoning process:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Filter given list of any python values only for integers.

    Args:
        values (List[Any]): A list of any Python values.

    Returns:
        List[int]: A list of only the integer values from the input list.

    Examples:
        >>> filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5])
        [5]
        >>> filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []])
        [1, 2, 3]
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to store the integer values
    integer_values = []

    # Iterate through the input list
    for value in values:
        # Check if the current value is an instance of the int type
        if isinstance(value, int):
            # If it is, add it to the integer_values list
            integer_values.append(value)

    # Return the list of integer values
    return integer_values
```

Reasoning Process Explained:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem statement is clear, and we need to write a function that filters a list of any Python values and returns a list of only the integer values.

2. **Approach**: We decided to iterate through the input list and check if each element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance()` function. If the element is an integer, we add it to the `integer_values` list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases gracefully. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. If the input list contains only non-integer values, the function will return an empty list as well.

4. **Efficiency**: The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once. This is an efficient solution for most practical use cases.

5. **Readability and Maintainability**: The function is well-documented with a clear docstring that explains the purpose, input, output, and provides examples. The code is also straightforward and easy to understand.
