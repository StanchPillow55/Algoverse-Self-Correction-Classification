Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to implement a function `mean_absolute_deviation` that takes a list of floating-point numbers as input and calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) around the mean of the dataset.

2. **Defining Mean Absolute Deviation**: Mean Absolute Deviation is a measure of statistical dispersion that represents the average absolute difference between each element and the mean of the dataset. The formula for MAD is:

   ```
   MAD = average | x - x_mean |
   ```

   Where `x` represents each element in the dataset, and `x_mean` is the mean of the dataset.

3. **Approach**: To calculate the Mean Absolute Deviation, we need to follow these steps:
   a. Calculate the mean of the dataset.
   b. Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean.
   c. Calculate the average of the absolute differences.

4. **Implementing the Solution**:

```python
from typing import List

def mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float:
    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    >>> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
    1.0
    """
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the dataset
    mean = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

    # Step 2: Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean
    absolute_differences = [abs(num - mean) for num in numbers]

    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the absolute differences
    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / len(numbers)

    return mad
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Calculate the mean of the dataset**: We use the formula `sum(numbers) / len(numbers)` to calculate the mean of the input list of numbers.

2. **Calculate the absolute difference between each element and the mean**: We use a list comprehension to create a new list of absolute differences between each element and the mean.

3. **Calculate the average of the absolute differences**: We sum up all the absolute differences and divide by the length of the list to get the final Mean Absolute Deviation.

The function returns the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation as a float.

The provided example usage `mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])` should return `1.0`, as the mean of the dataset is `2.5`, and the absolute differences from the mean are `[1.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]`, with an average of `1.0`.
