Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the strongest extension for a given class name and a list of extensions. The strength of an extension is determined by the fraction of uppercase letters (CAP) minus the number of lowercase letters (SM) in the extension's name.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Iterate through the list of extensions.
   b. For each extension, calculate its strength by counting the uppercase and lowercase letters.
   c. Keep track of the extension with the highest strength.
   d. If there are multiple extensions with the same highest strength, choose the one that appears first in the list.
   e. Return the class name and the name of the strongest extension in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    """
    Find the strongest extension for the given class name and list of extensions.
    
    Args:
        class_name (str): The name of the class.
        extensions (list): A list of extension names.
        
    Returns:
        str: The class name and the name of the strongest extension in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".
    """
    strongest_extension = None
    highest_strength = float('-inf')
    
    for extension in extensions:
        cap = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper())
        sm = sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        strength = cap - sm
        
        if strength > highest_strength:
            highest_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
        elif strength == highest_strength and extensions.index(extension) < extensions.index(strongest_extension):
            strongest_extension = extension
    
    return f"{class_name}.{strongest_extension}"
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We initialize two variables: `strongest_extension` to keep track of the strongest extension, and `highest_strength` to keep track of the highest strength found so far.

2. We iterate through the list of extensions using a `for` loop.

3. For each extension, we calculate its strength by counting the number of uppercase letters (`cap`) and the number of lowercase letters (`sm`), and then subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters.

4. If the current extension's strength is greater than the highest strength found so far, we update `highest_strength` and `strongest_extension` accordingly.

5. If the current extension's strength is equal to the highest strength found so far, we compare the indices of the extensions in the original list. If the current extension appears earlier in the list, we update `strongest_extension` to the current extension.

6. Finally, we return the class name and the name of the strongest extension in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName".

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of extensions, as we need to iterate through the list of extensions once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space to store the variables.
