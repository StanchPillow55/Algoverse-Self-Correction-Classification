Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `specialFilter` takes an array of numbers as input and returns the count of elements in the array that satisfy the following two conditions:
   - The number is greater than 10.
   - The first and last digits of the number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Iterate through the input array of numbers.
   - For each number, check if it is greater than 10.
   - If the number is greater than 10, extract the first and last digits.
   - Check if the first and last digits are odd.
   - If both conditions are met, increment the count.
   - Return the final count.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """
    Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    """
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Check if the number is greater than 10
        if num > 10:
            # Convert the number to a string to extract the first and last digits
            num_str = str(abs(num))
            # Check if the first and last digits are odd
            if int(num_str[0]) % 2 != 0 and int(num_str[-1]) % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the given conditions.
2. We iterate through the input array `nums` using a `for` loop.
3. For each number `num` in the array, we first check if it is greater than 10 using the condition `if num > 10`.
4. If the number is greater than 10, we convert it to a string using `str(abs(num))` to extract the first and last digits. We use `abs()` to handle negative numbers.
5. We then check if the first and last digits are odd by converting them to integers using `int(num_str[0])` and `int(num_str[-1])`, and checking if the remainder of dividing them by 2 is not equal to 0 (`% 2 != 0`).
6. If both conditions are met (the number is greater than 10 and the first and last digits are odd), we increment the `count` variable.
7. Finally, we return the `count` variable, which represents the number of elements in the input array that satisfy the given conditions.

This implementation should work for the provided examples and any other input array of numbers.
