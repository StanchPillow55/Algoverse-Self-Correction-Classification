Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `hex_key(num)` takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime numbers. The prime numbers in the hexadecimal system are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 (B), and 13 (D).

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Convert the input hexadecimal string to a list of individual hexadecimal digits.
   b. Check if each digit is a prime number.
   c. Count the number of prime digits and return the result.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

   a. **Converting the input to a list of digits**:
      - We can use the `list()` function to convert the input string to a list of characters.
      - Then, we can use a list comprehension to convert each character to its corresponding integer value.

   b. **Checking if a digit is a prime number**:
      - We can define a helper function `is_prime(n)` that takes an integer and returns `True` if it is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.
      - The function can use a simple loop to check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

   c. **Counting the number of prime digits**:
      - We can use a list comprehension to filter the list of digits and keep only the prime ones.
      - The length of the resulting list will be the number of prime digits.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):
    """
    Counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes.
    
    Args:
        num (str): A hexadecimal number as a string.
    
    Returns:
        int: The number of prime hexadecimal digits.
    """
    # Convert the input string to a list of digits
    digits = [int(d, 16) for d in list(num)]
    
    # Count the number of prime digits
    prime_digits = [d for d in digits if is_prime(d)]
    return len(prime_digits)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime(n)` function checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. It first checks if the number is less than 2, in which case it returns `False` (as prime numbers are greater than 1). Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`, otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. The `hex_key(num)` function first converts the input string `num` to a list of individual digits using a list comprehension. The `int(d, 16)` function converts each character `d` to its corresponding integer value in the hexadecimal system.

3. Then, the function uses another list comprehension to filter the list of digits and keep only the prime ones. The `[d for d in digits if is_prime(d)]` expression creates a new list containing only the digits that are prime numbers, as determined by the `is_prime(n)` function.

4. Finally, the function returns the length of the resulting list of prime digits, which represents the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)), where n is the number of digits in the input string, as the `is_prime(n)` function checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Convert the input hexadecimal string to a list of individual hexadecimal digits.
   b. Check each digit to see if it is a prime number.
   c. Count the number of prime digits and return the result.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

   a. **Convert the input hexadecimal string to a list of individual hexadecimal digits**:
      - We can use a list comprehension to split the input string into a list of characters.
      - Then, we can convert each character to its corresponding integer value using the `int()` function with the base `16` (hexadecimal).

   b. **Check each digit to see if it is a prime number**:
      - We can define a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer and returns `True` if it is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.
      - The `is_prime` function can use a simple loop to check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

   c. **Count the number of prime digits and return the result**:
      - We can use a list comprehension to filter the list of digits to only include the prime numbers.
      - The length of the resulting list will be the number of prime digits.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def hex_key(num):

    # Convert the input string to a list of hexadecimal digits
    digits = [int(d, 16) for d in list(num)]

    # Count the number of prime digits
    prime_digits = [d for d in digits if is_prime(d)]
    return len(prime_digits)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime` function takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise. It checks if the number is less than 2 (which are not prime numbers) and then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

2. The `hex_key` function first converts the input string `num` to a list of individual hexadecimal digits using a list comprehension. The `int(d, 16)` part converts each character `d` to its corresponding integer value in the hexadecimal system.

3. Then, the function uses another list comprehension to filter the list of digits to only include the prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is used to check if each digit is a prime number.

4. Finally, the function returns the length of the resulting list of prime digits, which is the answer to the problem.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(n)), where n is the number of digits in the input string, as the `is_prime` function checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number.

Reasoning Process:

2. **Approach**:
   - First, we need to convert the input hexadecimal string to a list of individual hexadecimal digits.
   - Then, we need to check each digit to see if it is a prime number.
   - Finally, we need to count the number of prime digits and return the result.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:

   a. **Converting the Hexadecimal String to a List of Digits**:
      - We can use a list comprehension to convert the input string to a list of individual characters.
      - Then, we can check if each character is a valid hexadecimal digit using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods.

   b. **Checking if a Digit is a Prime Number**:
      - We can define a helper function `is_prime(n)` that takes a decimal number and checks if it is a prime number.
      - This function can use a simple loop to check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number.
      - We can then use this helper function to check if each hexadecimal digit is a prime number.

   c. **Counting the Number of Prime Digits**:
      - We can use a loop to iterate through the list of digits and count the number of prime digits.
      - We can return the final count as the result of the `hex_key(num)` function.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False

    for d in digits:
        if d.isdigit():
            if is_prime(int(d)):
                prime_count += 1
        elif d.isalpha():
            if is_prime(ord(d) - ord('A') + 10):
                prime_count += 1
    
    return prime_count
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime(n)` function takes a decimal number `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It first checks if the number is less than 2, which is not a prime number. Then, it checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If no such divisor is found, the number is considered prime.

2. The `hex_key(num)` function first converts the input string `num` to a list of individual digits using a list comprehension. It checks if each character is a valid hexadecimal digit using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods.

3. The function then iterates through the list of digits and checks if each digit is a prime number using the `is_prime(n)` helper function. For digits that are numbers, it converts the digit to an integer and checks if it is prime. For digits that are letters, it converts the letter to a decimal number (using the `ord()` function) and subtracts the ASCII value of 'A' to get the corresponding decimal value, then checks if that value is prime.

4. The function keeps a count of the number of prime digits and returns the final count as the result.
