Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the problem**: The problem requires us to determine whether the length of the intersection of two given intervals is a prime number. If the length is a prime number, we should return "YES", otherwise, we should return "NO". If the two intervals don't intersect, we should return "NO".

2. **Identifying the input and output**: The function `intersection` takes two intervals as input, where each interval is represented as a pair of integers (start, end). The function should return a string, either "YES" or "NO", based on the condition mentioned in the problem statement.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Check if the two intervals intersect. If they don't, return "NO".
   b. Calculate the length of the intersection.
   c. Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number.
   d. Return "YES" if the length is a prime number, otherwise, return "NO".

4. **Implementing the solution**:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    """
    Determine whether the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number.
    """
    # Check if the intervals intersect
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    if end1 < start2 or end2 < start1:
        return "NO"

    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)
    intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start + 1

    # Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number
    if is_prime(intersection_length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define a helper function `is_prime` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. This function checks if the number is less than 2 (which are not prime numbers) and then checks if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of the number.

2. In the `intersection` function, we first check if the two intervals intersect. We do this by comparing the end of the first interval with the start of the second interval, and the end of the second interval with the start of the first interval. If either of these comparisons shows that the intervals don't overlap, we return "NO".

3. If the intervals do intersect, we calculate the start and end of the intersection by taking the maximum of the two start values and the minimum of the two end values, respectively. We then calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start from the end and adding 1 (since the intervals are closed).

4. Finally, we check if the length of the intersection is a prime number using the `is_prime` helper function. If the length is a prime number, we return "YES", otherwise, we return "NO".

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection, as the `is_prime` function checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number. The overall time complexity of the `intersection` function is also O(sqrt(n)), as the other operations (checking for intersection and calculating the length) are constant-time operations.

   a. Determine if the two intervals intersect.
   b. If they intersect, calculate the length of the intersection.
   c. Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number.

    intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start + 1

    # Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number
    if is_prime(intersection_length):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We define a helper function `is_prime` that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise.

2. In the `intersection` function, we first determine if the two intervals intersect. We do this by checking if the start of one interval is greater than the end of the other interval, or vice versa. If this is the case, the two intervals don't intersect, and we return "NO".

3. If the intervals do intersect, we calculate the start and end of the intersection by taking the maximum of the start values and the minimum of the end values, respectively. We then calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start of the intersection from the end of the intersection and adding 1 (since the intervals are closed).

4. Finally, we check if the length of the intersection is a prime number using the `is_prime` helper function. If the length is a prime number, we return "YES", otherwise, we return "NO".

This solution has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), where n is the length of the intersection, as the `is_prime` function checks for prime numbers up to the square root of the input. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space.
