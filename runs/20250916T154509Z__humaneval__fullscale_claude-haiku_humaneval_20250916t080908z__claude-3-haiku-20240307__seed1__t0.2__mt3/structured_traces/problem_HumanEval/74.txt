Certainly! Let's break down the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The function `total_match` takes two lists of strings as input and returns the list that has the total number of characters in all its strings less than the other list. If the two lists have the same total number of characters, the function should return the first list.

2. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   - Both input lists are empty: the function should return an empty list.
   - The two lists have the same total number of characters: the function should return the first list.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   - Calculate the total number of characters in each list.
   - Compare the total number of characters in the two lists.
   - Return the list with the lower total number of characters, or the first list if they have the same total.

4. **Implementation**: Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']
    """
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    total2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)

    # Compare the total number of characters and return the appropriate list
    if total1 <= total2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2
```

Explanation:

1. We define the function `total_match` that takes two lists of strings as input.
2. Inside the function, we calculate the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression and the `sum` function.
3. We then compare the total number of characters in the two lists.
4. If the total number of characters in the first list is less than or equal to the total number of characters in the second list, we return the first list.
5. If the total number of characters in the second list is less than the total number of characters in the first list, we return the second list.
6. If the two lists have the same total number of characters, we return the first list as per the problem statement.

This solution handles all the edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.

    if total1 <= total2:
        return lst1
    else:

```

Explanation:

1. The function `total_match` takes two lists of strings, `lst1` and `lst2`, as input.
2. We calculate the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression and the `sum` function. This gives us the total number of characters in `lst1` and `lst2`.
3. We then compare the total number of characters in the two lists. If the total for `lst1` is less than or equal to the total for `lst2`, we return `lst1`. Otherwise, we return `lst2`.
4. If the two lists have the same total number of characters, the function will return `lst1` as per the problem statement.

This solution covers all the examples provided and should work for any valid input lists.

If the two lists have the same total number of characters, the function should return the first list.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples cover various scenarios, including empty lists, lists with different lengths, and lists with the same total number of characters. These examples help us understand the expected behavior of the function.

3. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Calculate the total number of characters in each list.
   b. Compare the total number of characters in the two lists.
   c. Return the list with the lower total number of characters. If the totals are equal, return the first list.

4. **Pseudocode**:
   ```
   function total_match(lst1, lst2):
       if lst1 is empty and lst2 is empty:
           return []
       
       calculate the total number of characters in lst1
       calculate the total number of characters in lst2
       
       if the total number of characters in lst1 is less than or equal to the total number of characters in lst2:
           return lst1
       else:
           return lst2
   ```

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition in Python:

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    """
    Write a function that accepts two lists of strings and returns the list that has
    total number of chars in the all strings of the list less than the other list.

    if the two lists have the same number of chars, return the first list.

    Examples
    total_match([], []) ➞ []
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'Hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'Hi']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hi', 'hi', 'admin', 'project']) ➞ ['hi', 'admin']
    total_match(['hi', 'admin'], ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']) ➞ ['hI', 'hi', 'hi']
    total_match(['4'], ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']) ➞ ['4']
    """
    if not lst1 and not lst2:
        return []

    total_chars_lst1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    total_chars_lst2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)

    if total_chars_lst1 <= total_chars_lst2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2
```

Explanation:

1. We start by checking if both input lists are empty. If so, we return an empty list.
2. We calculate the total number of characters in each list by iterating through the lists and summing the lengths of the strings.
3. We compare the total number of characters in the two lists.
4. If the total number of characters in the first list is less than or equal to the total number of characters in the second list, we return the first list.
5. Otherwise, we return the second list.

This solution covers all the provided examples and handles the edge cases, such as empty lists, correctly.
