Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to take a sentence as input and return a new string that contains only the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers. The order of the words in the new string should be the same as in the original sentence.

2. **Identifying the Key Steps**: To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:
   a. Split the input sentence into a list of words.
   b. Check if the length of each word is a prime number.
   c. Construct a new string by concatenating the words with prime-number lengths, preserving the original order.

3. **Implementing the Solution**:
   a. **Splitting the Sentence**: We can use the built-in `split()` method to split the input sentence into a list of words.
   b. **Checking Prime Number Lengths**: To check if the length of a word is a prime number, we can use a helper function that checks if a given number is prime. This function can be implemented using a simple loop that checks for divisors.
   c. **Constructing the Output String**: We can iterate through the list of words and append the words with prime-number lengths to a new string, preserving the original order.

Implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    Returns a string containing the words from the original sentence
    whose lengths are prime numbers, in the same order.
    """
    # Split the sentence into a list of words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Construct the output string
    output = ""
    for word in words:
        if is_prime(len(word)):
            output += word + " "

    # Remove the trailing space
    return output.strip()
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. The `is_prime()` function is a helper function that takes a number `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. It checks for divisors up to the square root of `n`.

2. The `words_in_sentence()` function takes a `sentence` as input and returns a new string containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers, in the same order.
   - The sentence is split into a list of words using the `split()` method.
   - An empty string `output` is initialized to store the words with prime-number lengths.
   - The function iterates through the list of words and checks if the length of each word is a prime number using the `is_prime()` helper function.
   - If the length of the word is a prime number, the word is appended to the `output` string, followed by a space.
   - After the loop, the trailing space is removed from the `output` string using the `strip()` method, and the resulting string is returned.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the number of words in the sentence, and m is the maximum length of a word. The space complexity is O(n), as we are creating a new string to store the words with prime-number lengths.

   b. Check if the length of each word is a prime number.
   c. Construct a new string by concatenating the words with prime-length.

3. **Checking for Prime Numbers**: To determine if the length of a word is a prime number, we can use a helper function that checks if a given number is prime. This function can be implemented using a simple loop that checks for divisors.

4. **Handling the Constraints**: The problem statement mentions that the sentence will contain only letters and the length of the sentence will be between 1 and 100 characters. We need to ensure that our solution adheres to these constraints.

5. **Implementing the Solution**: Based on the reasoning above, we can implement the `words_in_sentence` function as follows:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    """
    You are given a string representing a sentence,
    the sentence contains some words separated by a space,
    and you have to return a string that contains the words from the original sentence,
    whose lengths are prime numbers,
    the order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

    Example 1:
        Input: sentence = "This is a test"
        Output: "is"

    Example 2:
        Input: sentence = "lets go for swimming"
        Output: "go for"

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """
    # Split the sentence into a list of words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Filter the words with prime-length and construct the new string
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_words)
```

Explanation of the Solution:

1. The `is_prime` function is a helper function that checks if a given number is prime. It returns `True` if the number is prime, and `False` otherwise.

2. The `words_in_sentence` function first splits the input sentence into a list of words using the `split()` method.

3. Then, it uses a list comprehension to filter the words whose lengths are prime numbers. The `is_prime` function is used to check if the length of each word is prime.

4. Finally, the function joins the filtered words back into a new string, separated by spaces, and returns the result.

This solution adheres to the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, as it handles sentences with lengths between 1 and 100 characters, and it only considers words that contain letters.

3. **Handling the Constraints**: The problem statement provides the following constraints:
   - The length of the input sentence is between 1 and 100 characters.
   - The sentence contains only letters.

4. **Approach**: To determine whether a word length is prime, we can use a simple prime number checking function. We'll then iterate through the list of words, adding the words with prime lengths to the output string.

Implementation:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is prime.
    """
    if n < 2:
        return False

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def words_in_sentence(sentence):

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
        * sentence contains only letters
    """
    # Split the sentence into a list of words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Filter the words with prime lengths and construct the output string
    output = " ".join(word for word in words if is_prime(len(word)))

    return output
```

Explanation:

1. We define a helper function `is_prime(n)` to check if a given number `n` is prime. This function returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.

2. In the `words_in_sentence(sentence)` function:
   - We split the input `sentence` into a list of words using the `split()` method.
   - We use a list comprehension to filter the words with prime lengths, and then join them back into a string using the `join()` method with a space as the separator.
   - The list comprehension `[word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]` iterates through the list of words, and for each word, it checks if the length of the word is prime using the `is_prime()` function. If the length is prime, the word is included in the output string.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the number of words in the sentence, and m is the maximum length of a word. This is because we need to check the primality of each word length, and the prime number checking algorithm has a time complexity of O(sqrt(m)).

The space complexity is O(n), as we need to store the list of words from the input sentence.
