Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to find the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray within the given array of integers `nums`.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the Kadane's algorithm, which is a dynamic programming-based approach to find the minimum subarray sum.

3. **Kadane's Algorithm**: The idea behind Kadane's algorithm is to keep track of the minimum sum seen so far and the minimum sum ending at the current index. We can then update the minimum sum seen so far whenever we find a smaller sum.

   The steps are as follows:
   - Initialize `min_sum_so_far` and `min_sum_ending_here` to the first element of the array.
   - Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
   - At each index, update `min_sum_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `min_sum_ending_here`.
   - Update `min_sum_so_far` to be the minimum of `min_sum_so_far` and `min_sum_ending_here`.
   - Return `min_sum_so_far` as the final result.

4. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle the edge cases where the array is empty or contains only negative numbers.

Implementation:

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """
    if not nums:
        return 0

    min_sum_so_far = nums[0]
    min_sum_ending_here = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        min_sum_ending_here = min(nums[i], min_sum_ending_here + nums[i])
        min_sum_so_far = min(min_sum_so_far, min_sum_ending_here)

    return min_sum_so_far
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We first check if the input array `nums` is empty. If it is, we return 0 as the minimum subarray sum.

2. We initialize `min_sum_so_far` and `min_sum_ending_here` to the first element of the array. These variables will keep track of the minimum sum seen so far and the minimum sum ending at the current index, respectively.

3. We then iterate through the array starting from the second element.

4. At each index, we update `min_sum_ending_here` to be the minimum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `min_sum_ending_here`. This ensures that we are considering the minimum sum ending at the current index.

5. We then update `min_sum_so_far` to be the minimum of `min_sum_so_far` and `min_sum_ending_here`. This ensures that we are keeping track of the overall minimum subarray sum.

6. Finally, we return `min_sum_so_far` as the result.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`, as we only need to iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the `min_sum_so_far` and `min_sum_ending_here` variables.

Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to find the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray within the given array of integers `nums`.

2. **Analyzing the Examples**: The first example shows that the minimum subarray sum for the array `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]` is `1`, which corresponds to the subarray `[1]`. The second example shows that the minimum subarray sum for the array `[-1, -2, -3]` is `-6`, which corresponds to the entire array.

3. **Identifying the Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use the Kadane's algorithm, which is a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to keep track of the minimum sum seen so far and the minimum sum of the current subarray.

4. **Implementing the Solution**:

   a. Initialize two variables: `min_sum` to keep track of the overall minimum sum, and `current_min` to keep track of the minimum sum of the current subarray.
   b. Iterate through the `nums` array:
      - Update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `current_min`.
      - Update `min_sum` to be the minimum of the current `min_sum` and the current `current_min`.
   c. Return the final `min_sum`.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_min = float('inf')

    for num in nums:
        current_min = min(num, current_min + num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_min)

    return min_sum
```

Explanation of the Code:

1. We initialize `min_sum` to positive infinity (`float('inf')`) and `current_min` to positive infinity as well. This is because we want to find the minimum sum, and we need to start with a value that is larger than any possible sum.
2. We iterate through the `nums` array.
3. For each element `num`, we update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element `num` and the sum of the current element and the previous `current_min`. This allows us to keep track of the minimum sum of the current subarray.
4. We then update `min_sum` to be the minimum of the current `min_sum` and the current `current_min`. This allows us to keep track of the overall minimum sum.
5. Finally, we return the `min_sum`, which represents the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray within the `nums` array.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array, as we need to iterate through the entire array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the `min_sum` and `current_min` variables.

    return min_sum
```

Explanation of the solution:

1. We first check if the input array `nums` is empty. If it is, we return 0 as the minimum sum of any non-empty subarray is 0.

2. We initialize `min_sum` and `current_min` to the first element of the `nums` array. `min_sum` will keep track of the overall minimum sum, and `current_min` will keep track of the minimum sum of the current subarray.

3. We then iterate through the rest of the `nums` array, starting from the second element.
   - For each element, we update `current_min` to be the minimum of the current element (`nums[i]`) and the sum of the current element and the previous `current_min` (`current_min + nums[i]`). This ensures that we are considering the minimum sum of the current subarray.
