Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem is to write a function `how_many_times` that takes two arguments: a `string` and a `substring`, and returns the number of times the `substring` appears in the `string`, including overlapping cases.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can use a simple iterative approach. We'll start by checking the first character of the `string` to see if it matches the first character of the `substring`. If it does, we'll check the next characters to see if they match the `substring`. If they do, we'll increment the count. We'll then move on to the next character in the `string` and repeat the process until we've checked the entire `string`.

3. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider the following edge cases:
   - If the `string` is empty, the function should return 0.
   - If the `substring` is empty, the function should return the length of the `string` plus 1 (since an empty substring can be found at every position).

4. **Implementation**:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    """
    Find how many times a given substring can be found in the original string.
    Count overlaping cases.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.
        substring (str): The substring to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The number of times the substring appears in the string, including overlapping cases.
    """
    if not string:
        return 0
    if not substring:
        return len(string) + 1

    count = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(string):
        if string[i] == substring[0]:
            j = 0
            while j < len(substring) and i + j < len(string) and string[i + j] == substring[j]:
                j += 1
            if j == len(substring):
                count += 1
            i += 1
        else:
            i += 1

    return count
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. We start by checking if the `string` is empty. If it is, we return 0 because an empty string cannot contain any substrings.
2. Next, we check if the `substring` is empty. If it is, we return the length of the `string` plus 1, because an empty substring can be found at every position in the `string`.
3. We initialize a `count` variable to keep track of the number of times the `substring` appears in the `string`.
4. We use a `while` loop to iterate through the `string`. In each iteration, we check if the current character in the `string` matches the first character of the `substring`.
5. If the characters match, we start a nested `while` loop to check if the remaining characters in the `string` match the `substring`. We use the `j` variable to keep track of the index within the `substring`.
6. If the entire `substring` is found, we increment the `count` variable.
7. We then move on to the next character in the `string` by incrementing the `i` variable.
8. If the current character in the `string` does not match the first character of the `substring`, we simply move on to the next character in the `string` by incrementing the `i` variable.
9. Finally, we return the `count` variable, which represents the number of times the `substring` appears in the `string`, including overlapping cases.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the `string` and m is the length of the `substring`. This is because we need to check each character in the `string` and, for each character, we may need to check up to the length of the `substring`.
