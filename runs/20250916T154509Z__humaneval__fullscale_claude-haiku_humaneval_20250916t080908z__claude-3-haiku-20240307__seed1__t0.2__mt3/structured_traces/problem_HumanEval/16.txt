Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks us to write a function that takes a string as input and returns the number of distinct characters (regardless of case) in the string.

2. **Approach**: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
   a. Convert the input string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
   b. Create a set of the characters in the string to get the unique characters.
   c. Return the length of the set as the number of distinct characters.

3. **Implementation**:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """
    Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of.

    Args:
        string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        int: The number of distinct characters in the string.

    Examples:
        >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
        3
        >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
        4
    """
    # Convert the string to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive
    lowercase_string = string.lower()

    # Create a set of the characters in the string to get the unique characters
    distinct_characters = set(lowercase_string)

    # Return the length of the set as the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)
```

Let's go through the implementation step by step:

1. **Convert the string to lowercase**: We start by converting the input string to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, and we don't count the same character twice (e.g., 'x' and 'X' are considered the same character).

2. **Create a set of the characters**: We then create a set of the characters in the lowercase string using the `set()` function. Sets automatically remove duplicate elements, so we end up with a collection of unique characters.

3. **Return the length of the set**: Finally, we return the length of the set using the `len()` function, which gives us the number of distinct characters in the input string.

The docstring provides information about the function, including the input parameter, the return value, and some example usage.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to iterate through the string once to create the set of unique characters. The space complexity is also O(n), as the set can hold up to n unique characters.
