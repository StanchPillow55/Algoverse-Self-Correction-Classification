    You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between
    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).

    Vowels in the beginning and ending don't count. Return an empty string if you didn't
    find any vowel that meets the above condition.

    You may assume that the given string contains only English letters.

    Example:
    get_closest_vowel("yogurt") ==> "u"
    get_closest_vowel("FULL") ==> "U"
    get_closest_vowel("quick") ==> ""
    get_closest_vowel("ab") ==> ""
