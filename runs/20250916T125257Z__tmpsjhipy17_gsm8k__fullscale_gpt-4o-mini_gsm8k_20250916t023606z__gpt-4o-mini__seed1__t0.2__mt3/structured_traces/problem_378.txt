To solve the problem, we need to determine how many socks Lindsay has washed and how many she has missed.

1. **Understanding the total number of socks**: 
   Lindsay has a total of 50 socks that need washing.

2. **Calculating the number of socks washed**:
   - Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, the total number of socks in 10 pairs is:
     \[
     10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks/pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
     \]
   - Additionally, she washes 15 loose socks. 

3. **Total socks washed**:
   To find the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed, we add the socks from the pairs and the loose socks:
   \[
   20 \text{ socks (from pairs)} + 15 \text{ socks (loose)} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

4. **Calculating the number of socks missed**:
   To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks washed from the total number of socks:
   \[
   50 \text{ total socks} - 35 \text{ socks washed} = 15 \text{ socks missed}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of socks that Lindsay has missed is:
   \[
   \boxed{15}
   \]
