To solve the problem, we will break down the amounts Sharon received for each of her lost teeth step by step.

1. **First Tooth**: 
   - The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth.
   - Amount received: **$5.00**

2. **Next Three Teeth**: 
   - For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00.
   - Amount received for these three teeth:
     \[
     3 \text{ teeth} \times 1 \text{ dollar/tooth} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: 
   - For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the last three teeth, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Amount received for these two teeth:
     \[
     2 \text{ teeth} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/tooth} = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

4. **Total Amount Received**:
   - Now, we will sum up all the amounts Sharon received:
     - Amount from the first tooth: $5.00
     - Amount from the next three teeth: $3.00
     - Amount from the last two teeth: $1.00
   - Total amount:
     \[
     5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is **$9.00**.

Final answer: **$9.00**

To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Tooth**: Sharon received $5.00 for her first tooth.

   \[
   \text{Total after first tooth} = 5.00
   \]

2. **Next Three Teeth**: For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. 

   \[
   \text{Amount for next three teeth} = 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after first four teeth} = 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of those three teeth, half of that is:

   \[
   \text{Amount for last two teeth} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1.00}{2}\right) = 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after all teeth} = 8.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
   \]

Finally, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
