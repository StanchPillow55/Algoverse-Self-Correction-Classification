To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers using both packaging options.

### Option 1: Buying flowers in packages of 3

1. **Determine how many packages of 3 are needed for 18 flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{3 \text{ flowers/package}} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per package} = \$2.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ packages} \times \$2.50/\text{package} = 6 \times 2.50 = \$15.00
   \]

### Option 2: Buying flowers in packages of 2

1. **Determine how many packages of 2 are needed for 18 flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{2 \text{ flowers/package}} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:**
   \[
   \text{Cost per package} = \$1.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9 \text{ packages} \times \$1.00/\text{package} = 9 \times 1.00 = \$9.00
   \]

### Comparing the Costs

Now we have the total costs for both options:
- Cost for 18 flowers in packages of 3: **\$15.00**
- Cost for 18 flowers in packages of 2: **\$9.00**

### Calculate the Savings

To find out how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better price (packages of 2), we subtract the cost of the cheaper option from the cost of the more expensive option:
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost with packages of 3} - \text{Cost with packages of 2}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00
\]

### Final Answer

Vincent saves **\$6.00** by buying 18 flowers in packages of 2 instead of packages of 3.
