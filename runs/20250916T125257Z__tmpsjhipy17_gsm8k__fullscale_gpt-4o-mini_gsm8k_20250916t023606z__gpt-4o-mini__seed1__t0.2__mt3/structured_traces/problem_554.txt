To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day, and then find the difference between these two times.

### Step 1: Determine Ray's swimming time in cold water.

Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. Therefore, the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold water can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Time for 3 miles (cold)} = 3 \times \text{Time for 1 mile (cold)} = 3 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Ray's swimming time in warm water.

According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

First, we calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water:

\[
2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add 2 minutes to this time to find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water:

\[
\text{Time for 1 mile (warm)} = 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water:

\[
\text{Time for 3 miles (warm)} = 3 \times \text{Time for 1 mile (warm)} = 3 \times 34 \text{ minutes} = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between swimming on a hot day and a cold day.

Now we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day (warm water) compared to a cold day:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time for 3 miles (warm)} - \text{Time for 3 miles (cold)} = 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Ray takes **54 minutes longer** to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day, and then find the difference between the two times.

**Step 1: Calculate Ray's swimming time on a cold day.**

Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. Therefore, for 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a cold day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Ray's swimming time on a hot day.**

According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he swims in cold water. 

First, we calculate twice the cold water time:

\[
2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[
32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm. Therefore, for 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a hot day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between hot and cold days.**

Now, we find the difference in time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time on a hot day} - \text{Time on a cold day} = 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day, and then find the difference in time.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken on a cold day

Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. Therefore, to swim 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a cold day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken on a hot day

When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water. 

First, we calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water:

\[
2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[
32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, on a hot day, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes. Therefore, to swim 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a hot day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time

Now we find the difference in time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time on a hot day} - \text{Time on a cold day}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
\]

Ray takes **54 minutes longer** to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.
