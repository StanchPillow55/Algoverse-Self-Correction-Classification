To solve the problem, we need to determine how many lemons Tim collects from his trees over a decade (10 years). Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of trees**: Tim grows 5 trees.

2. **Determine the number of lemons collected per tree each year**: Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree every year.

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year**:
   - Since Tim has 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, we can calculate the total lemons collected in one year as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in one year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in one year} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected over a decade (10 years)**:
   - Since Tim collects 30 lemons each year, we can find the total for 10 years by multiplying the annual total by the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons in one year} \times \text{Number of years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lemons}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total number of lemons Tim collects in a decade is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]
