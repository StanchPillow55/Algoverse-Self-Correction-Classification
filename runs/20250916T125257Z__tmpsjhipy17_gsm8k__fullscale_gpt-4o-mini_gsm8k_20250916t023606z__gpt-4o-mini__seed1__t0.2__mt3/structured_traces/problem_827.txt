To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and the refund amount she will receive from Amazon. Then, we can find the difference between what she spent and what she gets back.

### Step 1: Calculate the Shipping Cost

The shipping cost consists of two components:
1. Cost per pound
2. Cost per mile

**Cost per pound:**
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.

\[
\text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.4 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost per mile:**
- The distance to the distribution center is 20 miles.
- The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

\[
\text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.6 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total shipping cost:**
Now, we add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to find the total shipping cost.

\[
\text{Total shipping cost} = \text{Cost per pound} + \text{Cost per mile} = 1.4 \text{ dollars} + 1.6 \text{ dollars} = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Refund Amount from Amazon

Milly purchased the book for $32, but Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price.

\[
\text{Refund amount} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Milly's Total Loss

To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund amount from the total cost she incurred (the purchase price plus the shipping cost).

**Total cost incurred:**
\[
\text{Total cost incurred} = \text{Purchase price} + \text{Shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3 \text{ dollars} = 35 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total loss:**
\[
\text{Total loss} = \text{Total cost incurred} - \text{Refund amount} = 35 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Milly will lose **$11**.
