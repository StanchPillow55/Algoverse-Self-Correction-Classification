To find out how many hours Bruce works over the three days, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Bruce's work hours on Tuesday:**
   - Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Tuesday} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Bruce's work hours on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he worked on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Hours on Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate Bruce's work hours on Thursday:**
   - On Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he worked on Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Hours on Thursday} = \text{Hours on Wednesday} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours Bruce works over the three days:**
   - Now we sum the hours worked on each day.
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = \text{Hours on Tuesday} + \text{Hours on Wednesday} + \text{Hours on Thursday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 5 + 10 + 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Hours} = 23 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Bruce works over the three days is \(\boxed{23}\) hours.
