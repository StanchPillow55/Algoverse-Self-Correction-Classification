To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank each day by Wanda and Ms. B.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day.

The tank's total capacity is 18,000 gallons. On the first day, Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the first day.

Now we add the amounts pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B on the first day.

\[
\text{Total water pumped on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the second day.

On the second day, Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the second day.

Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on the first day.

\[
\text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total amount of water pumped on the second day.

Now we add the amounts pumped by both Wanda and Ms. B on the second day.

\[
\text{Total water pumped on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total amount of water pumped over the two days.

Now we add the total amounts pumped on both days.

\[
\text{Total water pumped in 2 days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the remaining water needed to fill the tank.

To find out how many gallons are remaining to fill the tank, we subtract the total amount pumped from the tank's capacity.

\[
\text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer:

The amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is \( \boxed{6000} \) gallons.
