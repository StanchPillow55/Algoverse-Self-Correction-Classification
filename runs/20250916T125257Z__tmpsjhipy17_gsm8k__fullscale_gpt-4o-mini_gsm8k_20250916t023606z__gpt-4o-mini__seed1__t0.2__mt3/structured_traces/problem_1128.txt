To solve the problem, we need to determine Vince's current age based on the information provided about Liam's age.

1. **Identify Liam's current age**: 
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.

2. **Determine Liam's age two years ago**: 
   - Two years ago, Liam's age would be:
     \[
     16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Liam's age and Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince. Let’s denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \).
   - The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     14 = 2V
     \]

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago**:
   - To find \( V \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine Vince's current age**:
   - Since this age was two years ago, we need to add 2 years to find Vince's current age:
     \[
     \text{Current age of Vince} = 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

Thus, after working through the problem step by step, we find that Vince is currently:

\[
\boxed{9} \text{ years old}
\]
