To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Marisa receives as pocket money over 5 days.**
   - Marisa receives $5 each day.
   - For 5 days, the total pocket money is:
     \[
     5 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ dollars/day} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the lollipops Marisa buys each day.**
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the cost of one lollipop in dollars is:
     \[
     25 \text{ cents} = \frac{25}{100} \text{ dollars} = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day, so the total cost of lollipops per day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of lollipops over 5 days.**
   - The total cost for 5 days is:
     \[
     5 \text{ days} \times 1.00 \text{ dollar/day} = 5.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount Marisa saves in her piggy bank.**
   - To find out how much she saves, we subtract the total cost of the lollipops from the total pocket money:
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = \text{Total pocket money} - \text{Total cost of lollipops}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = 25 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after saving for 5 days, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank is:

\[
\boxed{20 \text{ dollars}}
\]
