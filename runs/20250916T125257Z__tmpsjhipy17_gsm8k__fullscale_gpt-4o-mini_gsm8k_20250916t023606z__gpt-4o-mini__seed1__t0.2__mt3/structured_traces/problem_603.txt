To solve the problem, we will first determine how much chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make in an hour, and then calculate the total amount they can produce together in 12 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate Ruiz's hourly production
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total pounds by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly production} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's hourly production
Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we already calculated that Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, we can find Marissa's production as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly production} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total production per hour
Now we can find the total amount of chocolate they make together in one hour by adding their hourly productions:

\[
\text{Total hourly production} = \text{Ruiz's hourly production} + \text{Marissa's hourly production}
\]
\[
\text{Total hourly production} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} + 45 \text{ pounds/hour} = 105 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total production in 12 hours
To find out how much chocolate they make together in 12 hours, we multiply their combined hourly production by the number of hours they work:

\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = \text{Total hourly production} \times 12 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = 105 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[
\boxed{1260} \text{ pounds}
\]

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa together.

### Step 1: Calculate Ruiz's chocolate production rate

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total pounds by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's chocolate production rate

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we already calculated Ruiz's hourly rate, we can find Marissa's rate as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3 \times 60}{4} = \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total chocolate production for both over 12 hours

Now that we have the rates for both Ruiz and Marissa, we can calculate how much chocolate they each produce in 12 hours.

**For Ruiz:**

\[
\text{Total chocolate by Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times \text{hours worked} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

**For Marissa:**

\[
\text{Total chocolate by Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times \text{hours worked} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total chocolate produced together

Now we can find the total amount of chocolate produced by both Ruiz and Marissa:

\[
\text{Total chocolate} = \text{Total chocolate by Ruiz} + \text{Total chocolate by Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of chocolate pounds made together by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is:

\[
\boxed{1260} \text{ pounds}
\]

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Ruiz's chocolate production rate.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total amount by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's production rate.

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we know Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can find Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production for both Ruiz and Marissa over 12 hours.

Now we will calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

**For Ruiz:**
\[
\text{Total for Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times \text{time} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

**For Marissa:**
\[
\text{Total for Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times \text{time} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of chocolate made together.

Now we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa:

\[
\text{Total chocolate} = \text{Total for Ruiz} + \text{Total for Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1800} \text{ pounds}
\]
