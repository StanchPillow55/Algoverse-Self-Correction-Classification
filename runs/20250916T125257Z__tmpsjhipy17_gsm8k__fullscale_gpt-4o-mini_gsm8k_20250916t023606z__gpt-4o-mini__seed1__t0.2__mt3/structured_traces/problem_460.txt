To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we will first calculate her weekly earnings from recycling the aluminum cans and plastic bottles, and then we will multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans.

Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda each week. Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.

\[
\text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Value per can}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles.

Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week. Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.

\[
\text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Value per bottle}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weekly earnings.

Now, we will add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total weekly earnings.

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} + \text{Earnings from plastic bottles}
\]
\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month.

To find out how much Grayson earns in a four-week month, we will multiply her total weekly earnings by 4.

\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer

Grayson earns a total of **84 cents** from recycling in a four-week month.

\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4.

\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
