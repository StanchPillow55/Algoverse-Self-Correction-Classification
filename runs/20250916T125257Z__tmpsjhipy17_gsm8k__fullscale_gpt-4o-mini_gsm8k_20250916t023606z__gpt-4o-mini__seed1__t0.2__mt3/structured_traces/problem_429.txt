To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of letters in both Indras' name and her sister's name based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of letters in Indras' name:**
   - We are told that Indras has 6 letters in her name.
   - Therefore, the number of letters in Indras' name is:
     \[
     \text{Letters in Indras} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of letters in her sister's name:**
   - The problem states that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.
   - First, we need to calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
     \[
     \text{Half of Indras' letters} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Next, we add 4 to this value to find the number of letters in her sister's name:
     \[
     \text{Sister's letters} = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

3. **Summarize the findings:**
   - Indras has 6 letters in her name.
   - Her sister has 7 letters in her name.

4. **Final answer:**
   - The number of letters in Indras' name is 6, and the number of letters in her sister's name is 7.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Indras: 6 letters
- Sister: 7 letters
