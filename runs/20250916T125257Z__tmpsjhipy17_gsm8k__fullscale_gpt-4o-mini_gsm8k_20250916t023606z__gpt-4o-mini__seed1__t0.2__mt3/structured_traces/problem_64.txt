To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the information given:**
   - Sophia has traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - The total capacity of her gas tank is 12 gallons.

2. **Calculate the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon):**
   - We know that she traveled 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas. 
   - To find the miles per gallon (MPG), we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{MPG} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank:**
   - Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of gas (12 gallons).
   - We use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{MPG} \times \text{Total gallons in tank} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon} \times 12 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Sophia can drive **300 miles** on a single tank of gas.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300 \text{ miles}}
\]
