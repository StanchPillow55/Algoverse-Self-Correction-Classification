To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to break down the costs into two main categories: the initial purchase cost of the plane and the ongoing monthly maintenance costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the Initial Purchase Cost
The initial cost of the plane is given as:
\[
\text{Cost of the plane} = \$150,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Maintenance Costs
James has two monthly expenses: hanger rental and fuel.

1. **Hanger Rental Cost**:
   \[
   \text{Hanger rental cost per month} = \$5,000
   \]

2. **Fuel Cost**:
   James spends twice as much on fuel as he does on the hanger rental. Therefore, the fuel cost per month is:
   \[
   \text{Fuel cost per month} = 2 \times \text{Hanger rental cost} = 2 \times \$5,000 = \$10,000
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Monthly Maintenance Cost
Now, we can calculate the total monthly maintenance cost by adding the hanger rental cost and the fuel cost:
\[
\text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = \text{Hanger rental cost} + \text{Fuel cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly maintenance cost} = \$5,000 + \$10,000 = \$15,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Annual Maintenance Cost
To find the total maintenance cost for the year, we multiply the total monthly maintenance cost by the number of months in a year (12):
\[
\text{Annual maintenance cost} = \text{Total monthly maintenance cost} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Annual maintenance cost} = \$15,000 \times 12 = \$180,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Cost for the First Year
Finally, we add the initial purchase cost of the plane to the total annual maintenance cost to find the total cost for the first year:
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \text{Cost of the plane} + \text{Annual maintenance cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for the first year} = \$150,000 + \$180,000 = \$330,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year is:
\[
\boxed{330000}
\]
