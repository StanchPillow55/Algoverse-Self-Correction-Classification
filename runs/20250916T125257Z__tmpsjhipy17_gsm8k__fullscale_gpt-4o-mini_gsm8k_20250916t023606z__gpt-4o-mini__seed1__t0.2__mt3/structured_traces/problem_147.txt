To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and keep track of the number of bees leaving and returning to the hive at each stage.

1. **First 6 hours:**
   - Debra sees **30 bees** leave the hive.

2. **Next 6 hours (6 to 12 hours):**
   - She sees **1/2** of the bees that left return. 
   - Since 30 bees left, the number of bees returning is:
     \[
     \text{Bees returning} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
     \]

3. **Next 6 hours (12 to 18 hours):**
   - Debra sees **two times** as many bees leave as the first group that left.
   - Since 30 bees left initially, the number of bees leaving now is:
     \[
     \text{Bees leaving} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
     \]

4. **Last 6 hours (18 to 24 hours):**
   - Every bee that left before this period and hadn't already returned will return to the hive.
   - The bees that left before this period are:
     - 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours.
     - 60 bees that left in the third 6-hour period.
   - The total number of bees that left before this period is:
     \[
     \text{Total bees left} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - Out of these, 15 bees returned in the second 6-hour period. Therefore, the number of bees that hadn't returned yet is:
     \[
     \text{Bees that hadn't returned} = 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees}
     \]
   - These 75 bees will return to the hive in the last 6 hours.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours is **75 bees**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
