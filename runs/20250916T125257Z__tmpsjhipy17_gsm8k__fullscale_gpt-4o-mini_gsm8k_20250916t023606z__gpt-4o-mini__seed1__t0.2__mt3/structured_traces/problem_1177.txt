To solve the problem, we will first determine how many boys and girls are on varsity, and then we will calculate how many students are not on varsity.

1. **Determine the number of girls on varsity:**
   - There are 12 girls in total.
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - To find one-third of 12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls on varsity} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]

2. **Determine the number of boys on varsity:**
   - There are 12 boys in total.
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - To find one-fourth of 12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys on varsity} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students on varsity:**
   - We add the number of girls and boys on varsity:
     \[
     \text{Total students on varsity} = \text{Number of girls on varsity} + \text{Number of boys on varsity} = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of students in the class:**
   - The total number of students is the sum of boys and girls:
     \[
     \text{Total students} = 12 \text{ boys} + 12 \text{ girls} = 24
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of students not on varsity:**
   - To find the number of students not on varsity, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Students not on varsity} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total students on varsity} = 24 - 7 = 17
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **17 students are not on varsity**.
