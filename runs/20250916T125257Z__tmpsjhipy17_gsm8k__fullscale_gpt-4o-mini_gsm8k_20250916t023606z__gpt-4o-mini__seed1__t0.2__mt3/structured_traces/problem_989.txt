To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We will break this down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. First, we need to find out how long it takes her to sauté 1 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook 1 shrimp} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp}
\]

Now, we can calculate the time to sauté 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = 90 \text{ shrimp} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. First, we find out how long it takes her to sauté one shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook 1 shrimp} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes/shrimp}
\]

Now, we calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 90 \text{ shrimp} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes/shrimp} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp

Now, we add the time taken to peel and the time taken to cook:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cooking the shrimp separately, and then sum those times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. First, we find out how long it takes her to sauté 1 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to sauté 1 shrimp} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp}
\]

Now, we calculate the time to sauté 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 90 \text{ shrimp} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time

Now we add the time to peel and the time to sauté:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
