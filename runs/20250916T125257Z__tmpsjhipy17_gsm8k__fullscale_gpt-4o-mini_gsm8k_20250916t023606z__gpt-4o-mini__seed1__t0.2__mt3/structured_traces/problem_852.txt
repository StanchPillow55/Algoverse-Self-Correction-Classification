To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while also considering the discount on the red food baskets.

1. **Identify the costs of the baskets:**
   - Cost of one basket of green food = $25
   - Cost of one basket of red food = $18

2. **Determine the total cost without discounts:**
   - Let's assume we buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food such that \( x + y = 3 \). 
   - We can consider different combinations of green and red baskets. However, the problem does not specify how many of each type we need to buy. For simplicity, let's assume we buy 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food. This is just one possible combination, and we will calculate the total cost based on this assumption.

3. **Calculate the cost for 1 basket of green food:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of green food} = 1 \times 25 = 25
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for 2 baskets of red food without discount:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of red food} = 2 \times 18 = 36
   \]

5. **Calculate the total discount for the red food:**
   - The discount is $2 for each basket of red food. Since we have 2 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for the red food after applying the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of red food after discount} = 36 - 4 = 32
   \]

7. **Calculate the total cost for all baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of green food} + \text{Cost of red food after discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 + 32 = 57
   \]

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay for 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food, after applying the discount, is **$57**.

**Final Answer: $57**

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while applying a discount for the red food baskets.

1. **Identify the costs of the food baskets:**
   - Cost of one basket of green food = $25
   - Cost of one basket of red food = $18

2. **Determine the total cost without discounts:**
   Let's assume we buy \( g \) baskets of green food and \( r \) baskets of red food. Since we are buying a total of 3 baskets, we can express this as:
   \[
   g + r = 3
   \]

   The total cost without any discounts can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (g \times 25) + (r \times 18)
   \]

3. **Apply the discount for red food baskets:**
   We know that there is a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Therefore, the cost of red food after the discount becomes:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Cost of Red Food} = r \times (18 - 2) = r \times 16
   \]

4. **Revising the total cost with the discount:**
   The total cost with the discount applied is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (g \times 25) + (r \times 16)
   \]

5. **Consider different combinations of green and red baskets:**
   Since \( g + r = 3 \), we can consider the following combinations:
   - Case 1: \( g = 3, r = 0 \)
   - Case 2: \( g = 2, r = 1 \)
   - Case 3: \( g = 1, r = 2 \)
   - Case 4: \( g = 0, r = 3 \)

   We will calculate the total cost for each case.

   **Case 1: \( g = 3, r = 0 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (3 \times 25) + (0 \times 16) = 75 + 0 = 75
   \]

   **Case 2: \( g = 2, r = 1 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (2 \times 25) + (1 \times 16) = 50 + 16 = 66
   \]

   **Case 3: \( g = 1, r = 2 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (1 \times 25) + (2 \times 16) = 25 + 32 = 57
   \]

   **Case 4: \( g = 0, r = 3 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (0 \times 25) + (3 \times 16) = 0 + 48 = 48
   \]

6. **Summarize the total costs for each case:**
   - Case 1: $75
   - Case 2: $66
   - Case 3: $57
   - Case 4: $48

7. **Determine the minimum total cost:**
   The minimum total cost occurs in Case 4, where we buy 0 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, resulting in a total cost of $48.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while also applying the discount for the red food.

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the food baskets
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18

### Step 2: Determine the number of baskets
We are buying a total of 3 baskets. We need to decide how many of each type of basket we are purchasing. For simplicity, let's assume we buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food such that:
\[ x + y = 3 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost without discounts
The total cost without any discounts can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = (25x) + (18y) \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount for red food
We are given a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Therefore, the cost of red food after applying the discount becomes:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost of Red Food} = 18y - 2y = 16y \]

### Step 5: Rewrite the total cost with the discount
Now we can rewrite the total cost including the discount:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 25x + 16y \]

### Step 6: Choose a combination of baskets
Since the problem does not specify how many of each type to buy, we can explore a few combinations. Let's consider two scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1:** 3 baskets of green food (0 red)
2. **Scenario 2:** 2 baskets of green food and 1 basket of red food
3. **Scenario 3:** 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food
4. **Scenario 4:** 3 baskets of red food (0 green)

#### Scenario 1: 3 Green Baskets
- \( x = 3, y = 0 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(3) + 16(0) = 75 + 0 = 75 \)

#### Scenario 2: 2 Green Baskets and 1 Red Basket
- \( x = 2, y = 1 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(2) + 16(1) = 50 + 16 = 66 \)

#### Scenario 3: 1 Green Basket and 2 Red Baskets
- \( x = 1, y = 2 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(1) + 16(2) = 25 + 32 = 57 \)

#### Scenario 4: 3 Red Baskets
- \( x = 0, y = 3 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(0) + 16(3) = 0 + 48 = 48 \)

### Step 7: Conclusion
The total costs for the different scenarios are:
- Scenario 1: $75
- Scenario 2: $66
- Scenario 3: $57
- Scenario 4: $48

The least amount you would pay is in Scenario 4, where you buy 3 baskets of red food, resulting in a total cost of **$48**.

### Final Answer
The total amount you will have to pay is **$48**.
