To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of clay dishes each person makes and then use the relationships given in the problem to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

1. **Define the number of dishes made by Kora**:
   - Let \( K \) be the number of dishes Kora makes.
   - According to the problem, Kora made 20 dishes, so \( K = 20 \).

2. **Determine the number of dishes made by Rory**:
   - The problem states that Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora. Therefore, we can express the number of dishes Rory makes (\( R \)) as:
   \[
   R = K + 20
   \]
   Substituting \( K = 20 \):
   \[
   R = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the number of dishes made by Jada**:
   - The problem states that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory. Therefore, we can express the number of dishes Jada makes (\( J \)) as:
   \[
   J = 2R
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 40 \):
   \[
   J = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three**:
   - Now we can find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora:
   \[
   \text{Total} = J + R + K
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 80 + 40 + 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 140
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together is \( \boxed{140} \).
