To find out how much money John spent at the market, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats and the cows separately, and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the goats:**
   - John buys 3 goats.
   - Each goat costs $500.
   - To find the total cost for the goats, we multiply the number of goats by the cost per goat:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of goats} = \text{Number of goats} \times \text{Cost per goat} = 3 \times 500
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3 \times 500 = 1500
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the goats is $1500.

2. **Calculate the cost of the cows:**
   - John buys 2 cows.
   - Each cow costs $1500.
   - To find the total cost for the cows, we multiply the number of cows by the cost per cow:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of cows} = \text{Number of cows} \times \text{Cost per cow} = 2 \times 1500
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     2 \times 1500 = 3000
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the cows is $3000.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the goats and the total cost of the cows together:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of goats} + \text{Total cost of cows} = 1500 + 3000
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     1500 + 3000 = 4500
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money John spent at the market is **$4500**.

Final answer: **$4500**.
