To determine how many recipes John learns in his cooking class, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of class hours**:
   - The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time.
   - Therefore, the total hours per week is:
     \[
     4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
     \]
   - The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total hours for the entire duration of the class is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine how many recipes John learns**:
   - John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.
   - To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total class hours by the hours per recipe:
     \[
     \text{Number of recipes} = \frac{\text{Total hours}}{\text{Hours per recipe}} = \frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}}
     \]

3. **Perform the division**:
   - To simplify the division, we can convert 1.5 hours to a fraction:
     \[
     1.5 = \frac{3}{2}
     \]
   - Now, we can rewrite the division:
     \[
     \frac{48}{1.5} = 48 \div 1.5 = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{48 \times 2}{3} = \frac{96}{3} = 32
     \]

Thus, John learns a total of **32 recipes** during the cooking class.

**Final Answer**: John learns 32 recipes.
