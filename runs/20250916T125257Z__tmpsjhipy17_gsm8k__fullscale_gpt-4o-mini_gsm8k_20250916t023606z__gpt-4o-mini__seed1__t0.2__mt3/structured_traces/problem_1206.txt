To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the loan John receives.**
2. **Determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts.**
3. **Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of the loan

John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 40\% \text{ of } 250,000
\]

To calculate 40% of $250,000, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
40\% = 0.40
\]

Now we multiply:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

So, John receives a loan of **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 60\% \text{ of } 100,000
\]

Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
60\% = 0.60
\]

Now we multiply:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts

To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the debt payment from the total loan amount:

\[
\text{Money Left} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Money Left} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, after paying off his debts, John has **$40,000** left.

### Final Answer

John has **$40,000** leftover after paying off his debts.

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the Loan Amount
John's house is worth $250,000. He decides to take a loan that is worth 40% of the value of his house.

To find 40% of $250,000, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = \text{House Value} \times \text{Percentage}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Amount Used to Pay Off Debts
John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We need to calculate 60% of the loan amount ($100,000).

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Percentage}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Amount Leftover After Paying Debts
To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used for debts from the total loan amount.

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Amount Used for Debts}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

### Final Answer
John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40,000}
\]

So, John gets a loan of **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount used to pay off debts
John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We need to find 60% of the loan amount ($100,000).

\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate the leftover amount after paying debts
To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

### Final Answer
John has **$40,000** leftover after paying off his debts.
