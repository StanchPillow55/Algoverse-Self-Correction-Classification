To find Sally's mean score from her math quizzes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **List the Scores**: First, we will list all of Sally's scores:
   - 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60

2. **Count the Number of Scores**: Next, we need to determine how many scores there are. 
   - There are 9 scores in total.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Scores**: We will add all of Sally's scores together to find the total score.
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:
   - \(50 + 80 = 130\)
   - \(130 + 80 = 210\)
   - \(210 + 60 = 270\)
   - \(270 + 40 = 310\)
   - \(310 + 90 = 400\)
   - \(400 + 100 = 500\)
   - \(500 + 70 = 570\)
   - \(570 + 60 = 630\)

   Therefore, the total sum of the scores is \(630\).

4. **Calculate the Mean Score**: The mean score is calculated by dividing the total sum of the scores by the number of scores.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{\text{Number of Scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   630 \div 9 = 70
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Thus, Sally's mean score is \(70\).

In conclusion, after calculating the total sum of her quiz scores and dividing by the number of quizzes, we find that Sally's mean score is \( \boxed{70} \).
