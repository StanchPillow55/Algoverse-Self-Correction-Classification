To find the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Group of People**:
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: **50 people**.

2. **People Entering at 10:00**:
   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 50 + 40 = 90 \) people.

3. **Twice the Number of People Entering at 10:00**:
   - The number of people who entered at 10:00 was 40. Twice that number is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80
     \]
   - So, 80 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 90 + 80 = 170 \) people.

4. **Additional Group of People by Evening**:
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the first group (which was 50) entered the restaurant. This is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \times 50 = 150
     \]
   - So, 150 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 170 + 150 = 320 \) people.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Now we have calculated the total number of people that entered the restaurant throughout the day:
     - Morning: 50
     - 10:00 Entry: 40
     - Twice the 10:00 Entry: 80
     - Evening Entry: 150
   - Adding these together gives us:
     \[
     50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
     \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day is **320**. 

Final answer: **320**.

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant throughout the day.

1. **Initial Group of People:**
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Total after morning} = 50
   \]

2. **People Entering at 10:00:**
   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   \[
   \text{Total after 10:00} = 50 + 40 = 90
   \]

3. **Twice the Number of People from 10:00:**
   - After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is:
   \[
   2 \times 40 = 80
   \]
   - Adding this to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total after additional group} = 90 + 80 = 170
   \]

4. **Three Times the Initial Group:**
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the initial group (which was 50) entered the restaurant. So, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 50 = 150
   \]
   - Adding this to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total after evening group} = 170 + 150 = 320
   \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:
   \[
   \text{Final Total} = 320
   \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day is **320**.
