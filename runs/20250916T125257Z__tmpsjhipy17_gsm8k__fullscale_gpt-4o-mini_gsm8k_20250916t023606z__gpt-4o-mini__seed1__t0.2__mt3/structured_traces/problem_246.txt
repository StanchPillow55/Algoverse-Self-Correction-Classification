To determine how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist:**
   The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of hours worked per day:**
   The makeup artist works for 6 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the daily cost for the makeup artist:**
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = \text{Hourly charge} \times \text{Hours worked per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily cost} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how many days per week the makeup artist works:**
   The makeup artist works 4 times a week.

5. **Calculate the weekly cost for the makeup artist:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = \text{Daily cost} \times \text{Days worked per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly cost} = 1500 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

6. **Determine the duration of the movie in weeks:**
   The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

7. **Calculate the total cost for the entire duration of the movie:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Weekly cost} \times \text{Duration in weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the discount given by the makeup artist:**
   The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 30000 \, \text{dollars} = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

9. **Calculate the final amount Jean has to pay after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup services is **$27,000**.

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services, applying the discount at the end.

### Step 1: Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist
The makeup artist charges Jean $250 per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked per week
Jean requires the makeup artist for 6 hours each day, and she needs this service 4 times a week. Therefore, we calculate the total hours worked in a week as follows:

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 24 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total hours for the entire movie duration
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. Thus, the total hours worked over the entire duration of the movie is:

\[
\text{Total hours for the movie} = \text{Total hours per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 24 \, \text{hours/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost before the discount
Now, we calculate the total cost for the makeup artist's services before applying the discount:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 120 \, \text{hours} \times 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the discount
The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost. We first calculate the amount of the discount:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Discount rate} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the final amount Jean pays
Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean actually pays:

\[
\text{Final amount paid} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars} - 3,000 \, \text{dollars} = 27,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Jean pays a total of **$27,000** for the makeup artist's services after the discount.
