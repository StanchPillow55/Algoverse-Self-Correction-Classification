turn 1
To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's current age**:
   - We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's current age**:
   - The problem states that James is now twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is currently 9 years old, we can find James's age by calculating:
     \[
     2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine John's age**:
   - John had James when he was 19. Since James is currently 18 years old, we can find John's current age by adding James's age to the age John was when James was born:
     \[
     19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son**:
   - The problem states that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. To find the current age of John's youngest son, we subtract the age John was when his youngest son was born from John's current age:
     \[
     37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years**:
   - To find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that John's youngest son will be **8 years old** in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
