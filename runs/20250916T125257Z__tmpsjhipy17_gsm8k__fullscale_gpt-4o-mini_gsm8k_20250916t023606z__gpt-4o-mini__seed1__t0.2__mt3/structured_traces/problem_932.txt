To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of water balloons that Maria and her 4 friends have after receiving their initial balloons and the additional balloons from Maria's mom.

1. **Identify the number of people involved**: 
   - Maria has 1 water balloon.
   - She has 4 friends.

   Therefore, the total number of people is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Maria)} + 4 \text{ (friends)} = 5 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Calculate the initial number of balloons**:
   - Each of Maria's 4 friends received 2 water balloons.
   - Therefore, the total number of balloons given to her friends is:
   \[
   4 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ balloons/friend} = 8 \text{ balloons}
   \]
   - Adding the 1 water balloon that Maria has:
   \[
   8 \text{ (friends' balloons)} + 1 \text{ (Maria's balloon)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the additional balloons given by Maria's mom**:
   - Each person (Maria and her 4 friends) received 3 more balloons from Maria's mom.
   - Since there are 5 people in total, the total number of additional balloons is:
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ balloons/person} = 15 \text{ additional balloons}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of balloons after receiving the additional balloons**:
   - We already calculated that they had 9 balloons initially.
   - Now, we add the additional balloons:
   \[
   9 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ total balloons}
   \]

Thus, the total number of water balloons that Maria and her friends have is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
