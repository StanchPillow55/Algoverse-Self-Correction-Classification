To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sunflower seeds from both the small and large sunflowers.

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - One dozen is equal to 12 seeds.
   - Therefore, the number of seeds in the small sunflower is:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - First, we need to calculate 50% of the number of seeds in the small sunflower:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Seeds in large sunflower} = \text{Seeds in small sunflower} + 50\% \text{ of small sunflower}
     \]
     \[
     = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflower seeds:**
   - Now, we add the number of seeds from both the small and large sunflowers:
     \[
     \text{Total seeds} = \text{Seeds in small sunflower} + \text{Seeds in large sunflower}
     \]
     \[
     = 36 + 54 = 90 \text{ seeds}
     \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is \( \boxed{90} \).
