To determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily apple consumption for both Marin and Nancy**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples a day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples they eat together in one day is:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Marin's consumption} + \text{Nancy's consumption} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total apple consumption over 30 days**:
   - Since they eat 8 apples together each day, we can find out how many apples they eat in 30 days by multiplying their daily consumption by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 30 days} = \text{Total daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   8 \times 30 = 240
   \]

Thus, Marin and Nancy together eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

**Final Answer**: Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together in 30 days.

1. **Identify the daily apple consumption for each person**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily apple consumption for both Marin and Nancy**:
   - Total apples eaten per day = Marin's apples + Nancy's apples
   - Total apples eaten per day = 4 apples (Marin) + 4 apples (Nancy) = 8 apples.

3. **Determine the total apple consumption over 30 days**:
   - To find the total apples eaten in 30 days, we multiply the total daily consumption by the number of days:
   - Total apples in 30 days = Total apples per day × Number of days
   - Total apples in 30 days = 8 apples/day × 30 days.

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - Total apples in 30 days = 8 × 30 = 240 apples.

Thus, Marin and Nancy together eat a total of **240 apples** in 30 days.

**Final Answer**: 240 apples.

To solve the problem of how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Daily Consumption**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate Total Daily Consumption**:
   - To find out how many apples they eat together in one day, we add their daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Marin's apples} + \text{Nancy's apples} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Consumption Over 30 Days**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat together over 30 days. We multiply their total daily consumption by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 30 days} = \text{Total daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     8 \times 30 = 240
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of apples that Marin and Nancy eat together in 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{240}
     \]
