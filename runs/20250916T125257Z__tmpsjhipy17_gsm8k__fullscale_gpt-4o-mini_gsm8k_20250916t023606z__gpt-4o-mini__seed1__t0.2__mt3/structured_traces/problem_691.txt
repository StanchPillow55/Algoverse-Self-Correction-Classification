To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vet visit, which includes the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Then, we will subtract this total cost from the amount of money John brought with him to find out how much he leaves with.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines
John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. 

\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = \text{Number of vaccines} \times \text{Cost per vaccine}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Let \( x \) be the total bill
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, we can express the cost of the heartworm check in terms of \( x \):

\[
\text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total bill
The total bill \( x \) is the sum of the cost of the vaccines and the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
x = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
\]
Substituting the known values:

\[
x = 40 + 0.6x
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x - 0.6x = 40
\]
\[
0.4x = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:

\[
x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the heartworm check cost
Now that we have the total bill \( x \), we can find the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
\text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x = 0.6 \times 100 = 60
\]

### Step 6: Verify the total cost
Now, let's verify the total cost by adding the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

### Step 7: Calculate how much John leaves with
John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total cost from the amount he brought:

\[
\text{Amount John leaves with} = \text{Amount brought} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Amount John leaves with} = 125 - 100 = 25
\]

### Final Answer
John leaves with $25.
