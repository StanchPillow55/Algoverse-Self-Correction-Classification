To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months she will be repaying the loan.

### Step 1: Calculate the interest on the loan

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to find out how much interest she will owe over this period.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10 (as a decimal)
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the interest rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}\):

\[
0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{0.10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{0.5}{12} \approx 0.04167
\]

2. Now calculate the interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.04
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount to be repaid

Now that we have the interest, we can calculate the total amount Karan will need to repay:

\[
\text{Total Repayment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Repayment} = 3650 + 152.04 \approx 3802.04
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment

Karan will be repaying this total amount over 5 months. Therefore, we divide the total repayment by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Repayment}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.04}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} \approx 760.408
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately **$760.41** per month.

To solve the problem of how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total interest on the loan.**
2. **Determine the total amount to be repaid.**
3. **Calculate the monthly payment.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. The interest can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}\):

\[
0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 0.04167
\]

2. Now calculate the interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount to be Repaid

The total amount Karan has to repay is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will pay this total amount over 5 months. Therefore, the monthly payment can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \approx 760.416
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to the nearest cent, Karan has to pay approximately:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} \approx 760.42
\]

Thus, Karan has to pay **$760.42** per month.

To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including interest, and then divide that total by the number of months over which she will make payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to calculate the interest for the loan.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum (which is 0.10 as a decimal)
- Time = 5 months (we need to convert this to years for the calculation, so \( \frac{5}{12} \) years)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \):
   \[
   0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 0.04167
   \]

2. Now multiply by the principal:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08
   \]

So, the total interest Karan will pay over the five months is approximately $152.08.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid

Now, we need to calculate the total amount Karan has to repay, which is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will make equal payments over 5 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately **$760.42** per month. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{760.42}
\]
