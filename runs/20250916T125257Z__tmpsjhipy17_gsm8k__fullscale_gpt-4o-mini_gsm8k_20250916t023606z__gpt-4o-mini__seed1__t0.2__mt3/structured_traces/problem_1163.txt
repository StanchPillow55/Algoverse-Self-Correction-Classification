To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Tyrion uses in a span of 2 days, given that he changes his face mask two times each time he goes out and that he goes out three times a day.

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of face masks used per outing**:
   - Tyrion changes his face mask **2 times** every time he goes out. This means for each outing, he uses **2 face masks**.

2. **Calculate the total number of outings in one day**:
   - Tyrion goes out **3 times a day**.

3. **Calculate the total number of face masks used in one day**:
   - Since he uses 2 face masks per outing and goes out 3 times a day, we can calculate the total number of face masks used in one day as follows:
   \[
   \text{Face masks per day} = \text{Face masks per outing} \times \text{Number of outings per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Face masks per day} = 2 \text{ masks/outting} \times 3 \text{ outings/day} = 6 \text{ masks/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of face masks used in 2 days**:
   - Now that we know he uses 6 face masks in one day, we can find out how many he uses in 2 days:
   \[
   \text{Face masks in 2 days} = \text{Face masks per day} \times 2 \text{ days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Face masks in 2 days} = 6 \text{ masks/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

Thus, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is **12**.

Final answer: **12 face masks**.
