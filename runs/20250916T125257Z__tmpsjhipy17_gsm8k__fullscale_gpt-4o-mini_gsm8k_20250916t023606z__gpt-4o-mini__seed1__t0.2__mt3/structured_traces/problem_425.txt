To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to Lillian's garden by both the bird feeders she built and the ones she bought.

1. **Identify the number of feeders**:
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total number of bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder**:
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each feeder that Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, each built feeder attracts:
     \[
     20 \text{ (birds from store-bought)} + 10 \text{ (additional birds)} = 30 \text{ birds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to the built feeders**:
   - Since there are 3 built feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (built feeders)} \times 30 \text{ (birds per built feeder)} = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to the bought feeders**:
   - Since there are 3 bought feeders, the total number of birds attracted to these feeders is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (bought feeders)} \times 20 \text{ (birds per bought feeder)} = 60 \text{ birds}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to all feeders**:
   - Now we add the number of birds attracted to the built feeders and the bought feeders:
     \[
     90 \text{ (birds from built feeders)} + 60 \text{ (birds from bought feeders)} = 150 \text{ birds}
     \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see a total of **150 birds** in her garden each day.

Final answer: **150 birds**.
