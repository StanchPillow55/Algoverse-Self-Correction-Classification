To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Elves**: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.

   \[
   \text{Initial number of elves} = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Elves Who Quit After the Incident**: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves this is, we need to calculate one third of 60.

   \[
   \text{Number of elves who quit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the Remaining Elves After the First Incident**: We subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number of elves.

   \[
   \text{Remaining elves} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Elves Who Quit After the Second Incident**: Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We need to subtract these 10 elves from the remaining number.

   \[
   \text{Remaining elves after second incident} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

5. **Final Count of Elves**: After both incidents, we find that the total number of elves left is 30.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Number of elves left} = 30
\]

Therefore, the final answer is **30 elves left**.
