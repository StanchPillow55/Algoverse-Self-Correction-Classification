To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area to be covered**: 
   We need to find two-thirds of the total area of the bathroom, which is 36 square feet.

   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

   To calculate this, we multiply:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

   So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 square feet of his bathroom.

2. **Calculate the number of mosaic tiles needed**: 
   We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. Therefore, to find the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot:

   \[
   \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft}
   \]

   Now we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   24 \times 24 = 576
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need a total of 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 576 \text{ mosaic tiles}
\]
