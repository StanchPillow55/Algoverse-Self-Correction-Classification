To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.**
2. **Determine how much money he gives to his sister.**
3. **Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving to his sister.**
4. **Determine how much money he spends on dinner.**
5. **Calculate the final amount of money he has after buying dinner.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has initially.

Ali has:
- Four $10 bills: 
  \[
  4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Six $20 bills: 
  \[
  6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total money Ali has:
\[
40 + 120 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money he gives to his sister.

Ali gives half of his total money to his sister:
\[
\text{Amount given to sister} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining amount of money after giving to his sister.

Now we subtract the amount given to his sister from the total amount:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 160 - 80 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much money he spends on dinner.

Ali uses \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining amount to buy dinner:
\[
\text{Amount spent on dinner} = \frac{3}{5} \times 80
\]
Calculating this:
\[
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{240}{5} = 48 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the final amount of money he has after buying dinner.

Now we subtract the amount spent on dinner from the remaining amount:
\[
\text{Final amount} = 80 - 48 = 32 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The amount of money Ali has after buying dinner is:
\[
\boxed{32} \text{ dollars}
\]
