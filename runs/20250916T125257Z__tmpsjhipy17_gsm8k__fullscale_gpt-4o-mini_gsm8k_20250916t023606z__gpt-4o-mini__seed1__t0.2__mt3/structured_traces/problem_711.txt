To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the special deal offered by the ice cream parlor: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

1. **Understanding the Cost of Scoops**:
   - Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.
   - With the deal, if Erin buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 additional scoop for free.

2. **Calculating the Cost for the Deal**:
   - If Erin buys 2 scoops, the cost will be:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/scoop} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With this deal, she will receive a total of:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} + 1 \text{ free scoop} = 3 \text{ scoops}
     \]

3. **Finding How Many Deals Erin Can Afford**:
   - Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of the deal she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of one deal:
     \[
     \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{3.00 \text{ dollars/deal}} = 2 \text{ deals}
     \]
   - This means Erin can buy 2 deals.

4. **Calculating Total Scoops from the Deals**:
   - Since each deal gives her 3 scoops, if she buys 2 deals, the total number of scoops she will get is:
     \[
     2 \text{ deals} \times 3 \text{ scoops/deal} = 6 \text{ scoops}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Erin spends:
     \[
     2 \text{ deals} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/deal} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - She spends all her money and gets 6 scoops of ice cream.

Thus, the final answer is that Erin should buy **6 scoops of ice cream**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the ice cream parlor's deal of "buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."

### Step 1: Understand the cost of scoops
Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. 

### Step 2: Determine how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal
First, we calculate how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00 if there were no deals:
\[
\text{Number of scoops} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per scoop}} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the deal
Now, we need to consider the deal: for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 additional scoop for free. 

#### Buying 2 scoops:
If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will pay:
\[
2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
\]
With this purchase, she gets 1 additional scoop for free, so she now has:
\[
2 \text{ scoops} + 1 \text{ free scoop} = 3 \text{ scoops}
\]

#### Remaining money:
After buying 2 scoops, Erin has:
\[
6.00 - 3.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars left}
\]

### Step 4: Buy more scoops with remaining money
Now, with the remaining $3.00, Erin can buy more scoops. We calculate how many additional scoops she can buy:
\[
\text{Number of additional scoops} = \frac{3.00}{1.50} = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Step 5: Total scoops
Now we add the scoops Erin has:
- From the first purchase (2 scoops + 1 free scoop): 3 scoops
- From the second purchase: 2 scoops

Thus, the total number of scoops Erin can have is:
\[
3 + 2 = 5 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Final Answer
Erin should buy a total of **5 scoops of ice cream**.

2. **Calculating the Cost of Scoops**:

     \[
     2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops}
     \]

3. **Determining How Many Sets of Scoops Erin Can Buy**:
   - Erin has $6.00. We need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with this amount.
   - Each set of 2 scoops costs $3.00. To find out how many sets she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of one set:
     \[

     \]

4. **Calculating Total Scoops**:
   - Since each set gives her 3 scoops, if she buys 2 sets, the total number of scoops she will get is:
     \[
     2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, which gives her 6 scoops in total, and she spends:
     \[
     2 \text{ sets} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/set} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This is exactly her budget.

Thus, Erin should buy a total of **6 scoops of ice cream**.

**Final Answer**: 6 scoops of ice cream.
