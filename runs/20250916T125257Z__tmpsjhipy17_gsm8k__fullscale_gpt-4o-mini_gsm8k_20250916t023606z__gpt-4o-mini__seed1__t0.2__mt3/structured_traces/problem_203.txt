To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total for the week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cheese used for sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for a week. There are 7 days in a week.
   - Each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for sandwiches is:
     \[
     \text{Total slices for sandwiches} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Slices per sandwich} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cheese used for omelets:**
   - Carl ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast for 3 days.
   - Each omelet uses one more slice of cheese than each sandwich. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses:
     \[
     \text{Slices per omelet} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for omelets is:
     \[
     \text{Total slices for omelets} = \text{Number of omelets} \times \text{Slices per omelet} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cheese used for macaroni and cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese for it.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Total slices for macaroni and cheese} = 8 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total slices of cheese used for the week:**
   - Now we will sum up all the slices of cheese used for sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese:
     \[
     \text{Total slices of cheese} = \text{Total slices for sandwiches} + \text{Total slices for omelets} + \text{Total slices for macaroni and cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total slices of cheese} = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used for the week is \( \boxed{31} \).
