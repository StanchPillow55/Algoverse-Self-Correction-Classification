To find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs in cents, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the discounted price of the bag**: 
   The original price of a bag of beef jerky is $18.00. Since there is a discount of $3.00, we need to subtract this discount from the original price.

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost per stick of jerky**: 
   Each bag contains 30 sticks of jerky. To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks in the bag.

   \[
   \text{Cost per Stick} = \frac{\text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Number of Sticks}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per Stick} = \frac{15.00}{30}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   \text{Cost per Stick} = 0.50
   \]

   This means each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

3. **Convert the cost per stick to cents**: 
   Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so we multiply the cost per stick in dollars by 100.

   \[
   \text{Cost per Stick in Cents} = 0.50 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per Stick in Cents} = 50
   \]

Thus, each stick of beef jerky costs **50 cents**.

Final answer: **50 cents**.
