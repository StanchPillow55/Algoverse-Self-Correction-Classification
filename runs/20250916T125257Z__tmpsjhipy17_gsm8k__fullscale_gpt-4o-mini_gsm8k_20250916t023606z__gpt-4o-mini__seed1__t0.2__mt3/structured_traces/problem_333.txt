To find the cost difference between the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes, we need to calculate the total cost of each offer and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Furniture United

1. **Advance Payment**: $1,350
2. **Monthly Installments**: 6 installments of $350 each

   To find the total cost of the monthly installments, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total Installments} = 6 \times 350 = 2,100
   \]

3. **Total Cost for Furniture United**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance Payment} + \text{Total Installments}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 1,350 + 2,100 = 3,450
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes

1. **Advance Payment**: $1,100
2. **Monthly Installments**: 9 installments of $250 each

   To find the total cost of the monthly installments, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total Installments} = 9 \times 250 = 2,250
   \]

3. **Total Cost for Cozy Homes**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Advance Payment} + \text{Total Installments}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 1,100 + 2,250 = 3,350
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost difference between the two offers

Now that we have the total costs for both offers, we can find the difference:
\[
\text{Cost Difference} = \text{Total Cost for Furniture United} - \text{Total Cost for Cozy Homes}
\]
\[
\text{Cost Difference} = 3,450 - 3,350 = 100
\]

### Final Answer

The cost difference between the two offers is **$100**.
