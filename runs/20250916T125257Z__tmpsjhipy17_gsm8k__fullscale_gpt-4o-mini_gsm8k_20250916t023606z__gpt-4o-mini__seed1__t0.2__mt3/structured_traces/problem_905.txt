To determine how much free time Harold has left in his day, we need to analyze his daily schedule step by step.

1. **Total hours in a day**: There are 24 hours in a day.

2. **Hours Harold sleeps**: According to the problem, Harold sleeps for 10 hours each night.

3. **Hours Harold works**: The problem states that he works 2 hours less than he sleeps. Since he sleeps for 10 hours, we can calculate his working hours as follows:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = \text{Hours slept} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Hours Harold walks his dog**: Harold spends 1 hour each day walking his dog.

5. **Total hours spent on sleep, work, and dog walking**: Now we add the hours he spends sleeping, working, and walking his dog:
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = \text{Hours slept} + \text{Hours worked} + \text{Hours walking dog}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total hours spent} = 10 + 8 + 1 = 19 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculating free time**: To find out how much free time Harold has left in his day, we subtract the total hours spent from the total hours in a day:
   \[
   \text{Free time} = \text{Total hours in a day} - \text{Total hours spent}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Free time} = 24 - 19 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Harold has **5 hours** of free time left in his day.

Final answer: **5 hours**.
