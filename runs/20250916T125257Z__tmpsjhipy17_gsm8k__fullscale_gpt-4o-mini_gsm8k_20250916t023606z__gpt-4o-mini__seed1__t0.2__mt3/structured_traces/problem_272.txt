To find out how much change the cashier gives back to the mother after her shopping, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.**
   - The mother buys:
     - Cocoa: $4.20
     - Laundry: $9.45
     - Package of pasta: $1.35

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cocoa} + \text{Cost of laundry} + \text{Cost of pasta}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add the cost of cocoa and laundry:

   \[
   4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
   \]

   - Next, add the cost of pasta to this sum:

   \[
   13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
   \]

   So, the total cost of the items is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 15.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the change given back by the cashier.**
   - The mother pays $20. To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Change} = 20.00 - 15.00
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   \text{Change} = 5.00
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   The cashier gives back $5.00 in change.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5.00}
\]
