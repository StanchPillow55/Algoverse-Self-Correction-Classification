To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - The problem states that the drive from Bernadetteâ€™s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayneâ€™s hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's travel time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, he will arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 0 \text{ minutes (the time he leaves)} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater by -1 minutes, which is effectively 1 minute before the start time (0 minutes).

4. **Calculate when Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - Since it takes Bernadette 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{desired arrival time} - \text{Bernadette's travel time} = -1 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -17 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at 0 minutes, and Bernadette leaves at -17 minutes. The difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 0 \text{ minutes} - (-17 \text{ minutes}) = 17 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave **17 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

**Final Answer: Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.**
