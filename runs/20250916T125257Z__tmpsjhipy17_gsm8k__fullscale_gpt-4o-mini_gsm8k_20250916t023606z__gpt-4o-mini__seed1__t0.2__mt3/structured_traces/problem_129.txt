To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue generated by the hospital from the patients and the total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors' services. 

### Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patients per day.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Since there are 500 patients per day, we can calculate the total time spent on all patients as follows:

\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = \text{Number of patients} \times \text{Time per patient}
\]
\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = 500 \times 24 = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert total time from minutes to hours.

Since the doctors charge by the hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{\text{Total time (in minutes)}}{60}
\]
\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{12000}{60} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the doctors.

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for the doctors for the day is:

\[
\text{Total cost for doctors} = \text{Total time (in hours)} \times \text{Cost per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for doctors} = 200 \times 150 = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from the patients.

The hospital charges the patients $200 per hour. To find the total revenue from the patients, we first calculate the revenue per patient and then multiply by the number of patients.

The revenue per patient for the time they are seen (24 minutes) is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Revenue per patient} = \text{Time per patient (in hours)} \times \text{Charge per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Time per patient (in hours)} = \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue per patient} = 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from all patients:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of patients} \times \text{Revenue per patient}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 500 \times 80 = 40000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost for doctors}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 40000 - 30000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.

To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue the hospital earns from the patients and the total cost the hospital incurs for the doctors' services. 

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue from Patients

1. **Number of Patients per Day**: 500 patients
2. **Charge per Patient**: $200 per hour
3. **Average Time per Patient**: 24 minutes

First, we need to convert the average time per patient from minutes to hours:
\[
\text{Average Time in Hours} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated from each patient:
\[
\text{Revenue per Patient} = \text{Charge per Patient} \times \text{Average Time in Hours} = 200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from all patients:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Revenue per Patient} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 80 \text{ dollars} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost for Doctors

1. **Charge per Hour for Doctors**: $150
2. **Total Time Spent by All Patients**: Since each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we can calculate the total time for all patients:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Average Time in Hours} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the doctors:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Doctors} = \text{Total Time} \times \text{Charge per Hour for Doctors} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Profit

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost for Doctors} = 40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes}

### Step 2: Convert total time to hours

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from patients

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from the patients can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for doctors

Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. The total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ dollars}
\]

The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.
