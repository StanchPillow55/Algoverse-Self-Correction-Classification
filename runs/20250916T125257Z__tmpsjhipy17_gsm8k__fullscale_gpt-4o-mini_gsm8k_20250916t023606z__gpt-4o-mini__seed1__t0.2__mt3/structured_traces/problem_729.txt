To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

1. **Initial Number of People**: 
   At 8:00, there are 5000 people in line.

2. **People Who Voted by Midday**:
   By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted. We calculate the number of people who voted by midday:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Remaining People After Midday**:
   To find the number of people remaining after midday, we subtract the number of people who voted from the initial number:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

4. **People Who Voted by 16:00**:
   By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted. We calculate the number of people who voted from the remaining 3000:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]

5. **Remaining People After 16:00**:
   Now, we find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 by subtracting the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining people after midday:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people after 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \( \boxed{1000} \).
