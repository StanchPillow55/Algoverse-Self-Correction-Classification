To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet compared to Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet for David:**
   - The cost of the ride bracelet is $30.
   - Since the bracelet allows David to ride all 9 rides, he pays a flat fee of $30.

2. **Cost of individual ride tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - The cost of each ticket is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride in terms of tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for one ride} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 9 rides} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings for David:**
   - Now we compare the total costs:
     - David's cost (with the bracelet) = $30
     - Dasha's cost (with tickets) = $36
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Dasha's cost} - \text{David's cost} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount of money that David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual tickets is **$6**.

Final answer: **$6**

To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the ride bracelet for David
David buys a ride bracelet that allows him to ride all 9 rides for a flat fee of $30.

\[
\text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of tickets for Dasha
Dasha buys individual ride tickets. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets, and each ticket costs $2.

First, we need to calculate the total number of tickets Dasha needs for 9 rides:

\[
\text{Total tickets needed} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets per ride} = 18 \text{ tickets}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for Dasha to buy 18 tickets:

\[
\text{Cost per ticket} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Dasha} = 18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much David saves
Now, we can find out how much money David saves by comparing the costs:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets like Dasha.

To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet (David's cost)**:
   - The ride bracelet costs $30 and allows unlimited rides (up to 9 rides).
   - Therefore, David's total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of individual ride tickets (Dasha's cost)**:
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - Each ticket costs $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride in terms of tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per ride} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for Dasha} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets for all the rides. 

Final answer: **$6**.
