To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops during his 60-mile bike trip.

1. **Identify the first stop:**
   - Henry made his first stop after traveling 20 miles.
   - Therefore, the distance to the first stop is:
     \[
     \text{Distance to first stop} = 20 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Identify the second stop:**
   - The second stop was made 15 miles before the end of the trip.
   - Since the total trip is 60 miles, we can calculate the distance from the start to the second stop:
     \[
     \text{Distance to second stop} = 60 \text{ miles} - 15 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distance traveled between the first and second stops:**
   - To find the distance between the first and second stops, we subtract the distance to the first stop from the distance to the second stop:
     \[
     \text{Distance between stops} = \text{Distance to second stop} - \text{Distance to first stop}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Distance between stops} = 45 \text{ miles} - 20 \text{ miles} = 25 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the distance Henry traveled between his first and second stops is:
     \[
     \boxed{25} \text{ miles}
     \]
