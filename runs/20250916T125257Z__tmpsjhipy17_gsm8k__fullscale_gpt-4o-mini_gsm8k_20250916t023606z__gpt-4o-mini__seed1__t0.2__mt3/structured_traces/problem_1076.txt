To find out how much money Terry makes in total from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we will calculate the revenue from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each.
   - The total revenue from milkshakes can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = \text{Number of milkshakes} \times \text{Price per milkshake}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.
   - The total revenue from burger platters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from burger platters} = \text{Number of burger platters} \times \text{Price per burger platter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from burger platters} = 9 \times 11 = 99.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.
   - The total revenue from sodas can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from sodas} = \text{Number of sodas} \times \text{Price per soda}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from sodas} = 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Now, we will sum the revenues from all three items:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from milkshakes} + \text{Revenue from burger platters} + \text{Revenue from sodas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 162.00
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is **$162.00**. 

Final answer: **$162.00**.
