To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total spaces} = \text{rows} \times \text{columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]
   This means there are 36 spaces available for books in the shelving system.

2. **Setting up the equation for the number of books**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   x = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   We will rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2x = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   -x = 20
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by -1:
   \[
   x = -20
   \]

4. **Interpreting the result**:
   The result \( x = -20 \) does not make sense in the context of the problem since the number of books cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the phrase "20 more than double the number of books." 

5. **Revisiting the interpretation**:
   The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" should actually be interpreted as:
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = 2 \times \text{number of books} + 20
   \]
   This leads to a contradiction, as it implies that the number of books is dependent on itself in a way that is not possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   Given that the interpretation leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that Wendy's requirement cannot be fulfilled as stated. The problem may need to be rephrased or clarified to provide a feasible solution.

Thus, the final answer is that Wendy cannot carry a valid number of books based on the given condition.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total capacity of the shelving system, we can calculate the total number of slots available for books:
   \[
   \text{Total slots} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Understanding Wendy's requirement**: 
   Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of books she wants to place can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**: 
   Since Wendy wants to place these books in the shelving system, we need to ensure that the number of books she wants to place does not exceed the total capacity of the shelving system. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]

4. **Solving the inequality**:
   To find the maximum number of books \( x \) that Wendy can currently have, we will solve the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]
   First, we subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x \leq 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x \leq 16
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x \leq \frac{16}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 8
   \]

5. **Calculating the number of books Wendy wants to place**:
   Since \( x \) can be at most 8, we can substitute \( x = 8 \) into the expression for the number of books she wants to place:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Wendy wants to place 36 books in the shelving system, which matches the total capacity of the shelving system. Therefore, she needs to carry 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]

   \text{Total slots} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Calculating the number of books Wendy wants**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." We need to express this mathematically. Let \( x \) be the number of books. The phrase "double the number of books" can be expressed as \( 2x \). Therefore, "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   Since Wendy wants to fill the shelving system, we set the expression for the number of books she wants equal to the total number of slots available:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we need to isolate it in the equation. We start by subtracting 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 20 - 20 = 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x = 16
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

5. **Finding the total number of books Wendy wants**:
   Now that we have \( x = 8 \), we can substitute this value back into the expression for the number of books Wendy wants:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
