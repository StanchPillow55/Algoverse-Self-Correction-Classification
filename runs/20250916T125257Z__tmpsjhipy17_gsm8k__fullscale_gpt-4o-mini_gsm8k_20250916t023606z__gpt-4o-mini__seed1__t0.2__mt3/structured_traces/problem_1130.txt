To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of crayons per box**: Nik wants to separate 200 crayons into groups of 8. We need to find out how many boxes he will need.

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total crayons}}{\text{Crayons per box}} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ boxes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the crayons**: Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of all the crayons is:

   \[
   \text{Weight of crayons} = \text{Total crayons} \times \text{Weight per crayon} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the boxes**: Each box weighs 8 ounces, and since Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

   \[
   \text{Weight of boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Weight per box} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of crayons and boxes combined**: Now we add the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes together:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of crayons} + \text{Weight of boxes} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert the total weight from ounces to pounds**: Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight in ounces to pounds:

   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{\text{Total weight in ounces}}{16} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[
\boxed{25} \text{ pounds}
\]
