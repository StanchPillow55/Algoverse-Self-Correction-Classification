To determine how many stuffed goats Bubbles should buy so that they make up 30% of her total collection of stuffed animals, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the current total number of stuffed animals**:
   - Bubbles has:
     - 3 stuffed puppies
     - 5 stuffed koalas
     - 2 stuffed zebras
     - 4 stuffed frogs

   We can add these numbers together to find the current total:

   \[
   \text{Total stuffed animals} = 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14
   \]

2. **Let \( x \) be the number of stuffed goats Bubbles wants to buy**. After buying \( x \) goats, the new total number of stuffed animals will be:

   \[
   \text{New total} = 14 + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the percentage of stuffed goats**:
   We want the stuffed goats to make up 30% of the new total number of stuffed animals. The number of stuffed goats is \( x \), so we can express this as:

   \[
   \frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
   \]

4. **Solve the equation**:
   To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by \( 14 + x \):

   \[
   x = 0.30(14 + x)
   \]

   Expanding the right side:

   \[
   x = 4.2 + 0.30x
   \]

   Now, we can isolate \( x \) by subtracting \( 0.30x \) from both sides:

   \[
   x - 0.30x = 4.2
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   0.70x = 4.2
   \]

   Now, divide both sides by 0.70 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Bubbles needs to buy **6 stuffed goats** in order for them to constitute 30% of her total collection of stuffed animals.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
