To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack has after receiving a portion of Sophia's money.

1. **Initial Amount for Jack**: 
   Jack starts with $100.

2. **Amount Given by Sophia**: 
   Sophia gives Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. 
   To find out how much this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
   \]
   So, Sophia gives Jack $20.

3. **Total Amount for Jack After Receiving from Sophia**: 
   Now, we add the amount Jack originally had to the amount he received from Sophia:
   \[
   \text{Total amount for Jack} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Amount given by Sophia}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total amount for Jack} = 100 + 20
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   100 + 20 = 120
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, after receiving the money from Sophia, Jack now has a total of $120.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
