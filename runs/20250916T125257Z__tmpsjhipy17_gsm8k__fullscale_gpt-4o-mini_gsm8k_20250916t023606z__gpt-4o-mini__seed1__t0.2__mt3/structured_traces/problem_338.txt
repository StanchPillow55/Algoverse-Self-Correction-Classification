Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups. Therefore, we can denote the number of students in the smallest group as \( x - 10 \).

Now, we know that the total number of students in all three groups is 200. We can set up the equation based on this information:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by adding 10 to both sides of the equation:

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), which represents the number of students in each of the two equal groups, we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
\text{Number of students in the smallest group} = x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]

To verify, we can check the total number of students:

- Two equal groups: \( 70 + 70 = 140 \)
- Smallest group: \( 60 \)

Adding these together gives:

\[
140 + 60 = 200
\]

This confirms that our solution is correct. The final answer is \( \boxed{60} \).

Let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since there are three groups, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of students:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Simplifying the left side, we combine like terms:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
