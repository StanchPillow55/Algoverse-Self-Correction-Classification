To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed**:
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people in total, we can calculate the number of sandwiches required:

   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People served per sandwich}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed**:
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, we need:

   - Total meat needed:
   \[
   \text{Total meat} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Meat per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Total cheese needed:
   \[
   \text{Total cheese} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Cheese per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of meat and cheese**:
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound, and the cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. We can calculate the total cost for each:

   - Cost of meat:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = \text{Total meat} \times \text{Cost per pound of meat} = 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00
   \]

   - Cost of cheese:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = \text{Total cheese} \times \text{Cost per pound of cheese} = 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Now, we add the cost of meat and cheese to find the total expenditure:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 + 15.00 = 50.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Tyson would spend on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]
