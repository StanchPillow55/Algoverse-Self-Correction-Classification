To find the total number of posts that the Reddit group will have in March, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of members and their posting rate**:
   - The group has 1000 members.
   - Each member posts an average of 3 posts per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of posts per day**:
   We can find the total number of posts made by all members in one day by multiplying the number of members by the average number of posts each member makes:
   \[
   \text{Total posts per day} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Posts per member per day}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Total posts per day} = 1000 \times 3 = 3000
   \]

3. **Determine the number of days in March**:
   March has 31 days.

4. **Calculate the total number of posts in March**:
   To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the total posts per day by the number of days in March:
   \[
   \text{Total posts in March} = \text{Total posts per day} \times \text{Number of days in March}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total posts in March} = 3000 \times 31
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   3000 \times 31 = 93000
   \]

Thus, the total number of posts that the group will have in March is \( \boxed{93000} \).
