To solve the problem, we need to determine Dana's walking speed, running speed, and then calculate the total distance she can travel in six hours based on the time spent walking and running.

1. **Determine Dana's skipping speed**:
   - We know that Dana can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

2. **Determine Dana's running speed**:
   - The problem states that Dana's skipping speed is half of her running speed. Therefore, if her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

3. **Determine Dana's walking speed**:
   - The problem states that Dana can run at a speed four times faster than she can walk. Thus, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Running speed} = 4 \times \text{Walking speed}
     \]
   - We already found that her running speed is 6 miles per hour. Therefore:
     \[
     6 = 4 \times \text{Walking speed}
     \]
   - Solving for walking speed:
     \[
     \text{Walking speed} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent running and walking**:
   - Dana spends a total of 6 hours traveling. According to the problem, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
   - Time spent running:
     \[
     \text{Time running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time spent walking:
     \[
     \text{Time walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the distance traveled while running**:
   - Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):
   - Distance running:
     \[
     \text{Distance running} = \text{Running speed} \times \text{Time running} = 6 \text{ miles per hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ miles}
     \]

6. **Calculate the distance traveled while walking**:
   - Distance walking:
     \[
     \text{Distance walking} = \text{Walking speed} \times \text{Time walking} = 1.5 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total distance traveled**:
   - Total distance:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance running} + \text{Distance walking} = 12 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} = 18 \text{ miles}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Dana can travel a total of **18 miles** in six hours.
