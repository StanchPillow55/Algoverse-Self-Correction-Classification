To find out how many gifts Cherrie bought in total, we can break the problem down into parts.

1. **Calculate the number of gifts for the first two friends:**
   - Cherrie has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts.
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts for these 2 friends is:
     \[
     2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of gifts for the other three friends:**
   - Cherrie has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts.
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts for these 3 friends is:
     \[
     3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts}
     \]

3. **Add the gifts for all friends:**
   - Now, we add the gifts for the first two friends and the gifts for the last three friends:
     \[
     10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
     \]

4. **Add the additional random gifts:**
   - Cherrie also buys 10 more random gifts. We need to add these to the total we have so far:
     \[
     16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ random gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts that Cherrie bought is:
     \[
     \text{Total gifts} = 26
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
