To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges**: 
   - Sitti bought 34 oranges.
   - Juris bought 22 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges} = 34 + 22 = 56
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of people sharing the oranges**:
   - Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends.
   - This means there are a total of:
     \[
     \text{Total people} = 2 \text{ (Sitti and Juris)} + 6 \text{ (friends)} = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of oranges each person will get**:
   - To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
     \[
     \text{Oranges per person} = \frac{\text{Total oranges}}{\text{Total people}} = \frac{56}{8}
     \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

Thus, each person will receive 7 oranges.

**Final Answer**: Each person will get 7 oranges.
