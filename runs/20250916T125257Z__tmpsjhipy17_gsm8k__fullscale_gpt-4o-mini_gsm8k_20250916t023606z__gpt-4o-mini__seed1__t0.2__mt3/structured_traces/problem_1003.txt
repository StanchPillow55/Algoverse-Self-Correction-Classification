To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs associated with renting the studio and the variable costs associated with the number of students attending the sessions.

### Step 1: Calculate the fixed costs
The fixed cost for renting the studio is $25 per session. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we first need to determine how many sessions are held in a month.

- **Number of weeks in a month**: Approximately 4 weeks (for simplicity, we will assume 4 weeks).
- **Number of sessions per week**: 3 sessions.

Thus, the total number of sessions in a month is:
\[
\text{Total sessions} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ sessions}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total fixed cost for the month:
\[
\text{Total fixed cost} = \text{Cost per session} \times \text{Total sessions} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the variable costs
The variable cost is $1.50 per student per session. The studio currently has 10 students. We will calculate the total variable cost for the month.

- **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
- **Number of students**: 10
- **Total variable cost for one session**:
\[
\text{Total variable cost per session} = \text{Cost per student} \times \text{Number of students} = 1.50 \times 10 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total variable cost for the month:
\[
\text{Total variable cost for the month} = \text{Total variable cost per session} \times \text{Total sessions} = 15 \times 12 = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings
Now we can find the total earnings for the dance studio by adding the total fixed costs and the total variable costs:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Total fixed cost} + \text{Total variable cost} = 300 + 180 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$480**.

To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs and the variable costs associated with running the sessions.

1. **Fixed Costs**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.

2. **Variable Costs**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total variable cost per session is:
   \[
   \text{Variable Cost per Session} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Cost per Student} = 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost to run one session includes both the fixed and variable costs:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per Session} = \text{Fixed Cost} + \text{Variable Cost} = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.

5. **Total Sessions per Month**: Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is:
   \[
   \text{Total Sessions per Month} = \text{Sessions per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Month} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ sessions}
   \]

6. **Total Earnings per Month**: Now, we can calculate the total earnings for the month by multiplying the total cost per session by the total number of sessions:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings per Month} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Total Sessions per Month} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is **$480**.

To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs and the variable costs associated with the lessons.

1. **Fixed Costs**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.

2. **Variable Costs**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total variable cost per session is:
   \[
   \text{Variable Cost per Session} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Cost per Student} = 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost to run one session, including both fixed and variable costs, is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per Session} = \text{Fixed Cost} + \text{Variable Cost} = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Number of Sessions per Month**: The studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is:
   \[
   \text{Total Sessions per Month} = 3 \text{ sessions/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 12 \text{ sessions/month}
   \]

5. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings for the studio in a month can be calculated by multiplying the total cost per session by the number of sessions per month:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings per Month} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Total Sessions per Month} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is:
\[
\boxed{480 \text{ dollars}}
\]
