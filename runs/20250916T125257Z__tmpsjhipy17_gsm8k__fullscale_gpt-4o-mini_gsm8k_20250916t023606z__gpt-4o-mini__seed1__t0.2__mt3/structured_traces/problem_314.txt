To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the number of players in each category:

- Let \( d \) be the number of players on the defense.
- Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, we can express the number of offensive players as \( 2d \).
- The problem states that there is half the number of players on special teams as there is on defense, so we can express the number of special teams players as \( \frac{1}{2}d \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of team members:

\[
\text{Total members} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams}
\]

Substituting the expressions we defined:

\[
105 = 2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]

Now, let's combine the terms on the right side:

1. Combine \( 2d \) and \( d \):
   \[
   2d + d = 3d
   \]

2. Now add \( \frac{1}{2}d \) to \( 3d \):
   \[
   3d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
   \]

Now we have the equation:

\[
105 = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

To solve for \( d \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side:

1. First, divide \( 105 \) by \( 7 \):
   \[
   105 \div 7 = 15
   \]

2. Now multiply by \( 2 \):
   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players in each category:

- Defense: \( d = 30 \)
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, let's check the total:

\[
30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The total is correct, confirming that our solution is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}

Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   o = 2d
   \]

2. The number of players on special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

The total number of team members is given as 105. Therefore, we can express the total number of players as the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams:
\[
o + d + s = 105
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( d \):
\[
2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
(2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d) = 3d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]
To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can convert \( 3d \) to a fraction:
\[
3d = \frac{6}{2}d
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

Now we have:
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

To solve for \( d \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
d = 105 \div 7 \times 2 = 15 \times 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:
- Offense: \( o = 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, check the total:
\[
o + d + s = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105
\]

The calculations confirm that the total is correct, so the final answer is indeed:
\[
\boxed{30}

   \]

2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

The total number of team members is given as 105. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of players as:
\[
d + o + s = 105
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( d \) into the total equation:
\[
d + 2d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms:
\[
3d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can express \( 3d \) as \( \frac{6}{2}d \):
\[
\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

Next, we solve for \( d \) by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]
Calculating the right side:
\[
d = 105 \div 7 \times 2 = 15 \times 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on the offense and special teams:
- Offense: \( o = 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, adding them together:
\[
d + o + s = 30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The total is indeed 105, confirming our solution is correct. The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
