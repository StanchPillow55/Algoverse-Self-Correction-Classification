To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family is using when the power goes out. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights

Brianna's family consists of 4 people, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Number of people} = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flashlights in the rooms

There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights in the rooms is:

\[
\text{Flashlights in rooms} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Flashlights per room} = 8 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of flashlights

Now we can find the total number of flashlights by adding the flashlights carried by the people and the flashlights in the rooms:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights carried by people} + \text{Flashlights in rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of candles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. The problem states that there are two types of rooms: half of the rooms have small candles and the other half have medium candles.

1. **Small candles**: Half of the 8 rooms means 4 rooms have small candles. Each of these rooms has 4 small candles. Therefore, the total number of small candles is:

\[
\text{Total small candles} = \text{Number of small candle rooms} \times \text{Small candles per room} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

2. **Medium candles**: The other half of the rooms (also 4 rooms) have medium candles. Each of these rooms has 5 medium candles. Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:

\[
\text{Total medium candles} = \text{Number of medium candle rooms} \times \text{Medium candles per room} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of candles

Now we can find the total number of candles by adding the small candles and the medium candles:

\[
\text{Total candles} = \text{Total small candles} + \text{Total medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of items (candles and flashlights)

Finally, we can find the total number of items (candles and flashlights) that Brianna's family is using:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 20 + 36 = 56
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles Brianna's family has when the power goes out.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights
- There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
  \[
  \text{Total flashlights} = 4 \text{ (one for each person)}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candles
The house has 8 rooms, and the candles are distributed as follows:
- Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.

#### Small Candles Calculation:
- For the 4 rooms with small candles:
  \[
  \text{Total small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
  \]

#### Medium Candles Calculation:
- For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
  \[
  \text{Total medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of candles
- Now, we add the small and medium candles together:
  \[
  \text{Total candles} = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of items (flashlights + candles)
- Finally, we add the total number of flashlights to the total number of candles:
  \[
  \text{Total items} = 4 \text{ flashlights} + 36 \text{ candles} = 40 \text{ items}
  \]

### Final Answer
Brianna's family is using a total of **40 items** (4 flashlights and 36 candles) when the lights go out.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family is using when the power goes out. We'll break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights

1. **Flashlights for each person**: There are 4 people in the house, and each person has one flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the people is:
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for people} = 4 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ flashlight/person} = 4 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

2. **Flashlights for each room**: There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights/room} = 16 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

3. **Total flashlights**: Now, we add the flashlights for the people and the rooms together:
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights for people} + \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candles

1. **Small candles**: Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms with small candles} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of small candles is:
   \[
   \text{Small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
   \]

2. **Medium candles**: The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. The number of rooms with medium candles is also 4 (the other half of the 8 rooms). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:
   \[
   \text{Medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
   \]

3. **Total candles**: Now, we add the small and medium candles together:
   \[
   \text{Total candles} = \text{Small candles} + \text{Medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ candles}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of items (candles and flashlights)

Now that we have the total number of flashlights and candles, we can find the overall total:
\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 20 + 36 = 56
\]

### Final Answer

Brianna's family is using a total of **56** candles and flashlights when the lights go out.
