To solve the problem, we start by determining the speed of Martha's turtle based on the information given about her cat.

1. **Identify the speed of the cat**: 
   The problem states that Martha's cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtle**: 
   We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. Let \( v \) represent the speed of the turtle in feet per second. According to the problem, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   5v = 15
   \]
   To find \( v \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   v = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]
   Thus, the turtle crawls at a speed of 3 feet per second.

3. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**: 
   We can use the formula for distance, which is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Here, the speed of the turtle is 3 feet/second and the time is 40 seconds. Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the turtle can crawl a total of 120 feet in 40 seconds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120} \text{ feet}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how fast Martha's turtle can crawl based on the speed of her cat.

1. **Identify the speed of the cat**: The problem states that Martha's cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtle**: We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. We can express the speed of the turtle (let's call it \( T \)) in terms of the speed of the cat:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the cat} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the turtle}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the cat:
   \[
   15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times T
   \]

3. **Solve for the turtle's speed**: To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   T = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**: Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can find out how far it can crawl in 40 seconds using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the turtle can crawl a total of 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120 \text{ feet}}
\]
