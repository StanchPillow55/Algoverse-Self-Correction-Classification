To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:**
   - We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win.
   - To find 20% of 50, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

2. **Determine the number of remaining people:**
   - The total number of people is 50. If 10 people think horse #2 will win, the number of remaining people is:
     \[
     50 - 10 = 40
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:**
   - We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win.
   - To find 60% of 40, we calculate:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 0.6 \times 40 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

4. **Determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win:**
   - We have already established that there are 40 remaining people after accounting for those who think horse #2 will win.
   - Out of these 40 people, 24 think horse #7 will win. Thus, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
     \[
     40 - 24 = 16
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:
     \[
     \boxed{16}
     \]

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:**
   We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find this number, we can use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #2} = \text{Total people} \times \text{Percentage}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #2} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining people:**
   After accounting for the 10 people who think horse #2 will win, we need to find out how many people are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = \text{Total people} - \text{People for horse #2}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:**
   We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. Again, we use the percentage formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #7} = \text{Remaining people} \times \text{Percentage}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #7} = 40 \times 0.60 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win:**
   Now we need to find out how many people are left who think horse #12 will win. We can do this by subtracting the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #12} = \text{Total people} - (\text{People for horse #2} + \text{People for horse #7})
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of people for horse #12} = 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the number of people who think that horse #12 will win the big race is:
   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
