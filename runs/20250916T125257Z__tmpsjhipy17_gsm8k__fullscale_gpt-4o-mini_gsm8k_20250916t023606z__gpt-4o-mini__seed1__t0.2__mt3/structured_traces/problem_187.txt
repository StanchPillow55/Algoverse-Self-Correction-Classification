To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount owed**: Mandy owes Benedict $100.

2. **Determine the monthly interest rate**: The monthly interest rate is given as 2%, which can be expressed as a decimal for calculations:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount owed after each month**: The amount owed increases each month due to interest. The formula to calculate the amount owed after one month with interest is:
   \[
   \text{Amount after 1 month} = \text{Principal} \times (1 + \text{Interest rate})
   \]
   We will apply this formula iteratively for 3 months.

   - **After the first month**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102
     \]

   - **After the second month**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 \times (1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04
     \]

   - **After the third month**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 \times (1 + 0.02) = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208
     \]

4. **Final amount owed**: After 3 months, the amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (we can round to two decimal places).

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total amount Mandy should pay to Benedict after 3 months is:
   \[
   \boxed{106.12}
   \]

To solve the problem of how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount owed**: Mandy initially owes Benedict $100.

2. **Determine the monthly interest rate**: The monthly interest rate is given as 2%. This can be expressed as a decimal for calculations:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount owed after each month**: The amount owed increases each month due to the interest. The formula to calculate the amount owed after one month with interest is:
   \[
   \text{New amount} = \text{Previous amount} \times (1 + \text{interest rate})
   \]

   We will apply this formula for each of the 3 months.

   - **After Month 1**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102
     \]

   - **After Month 2**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 \times (1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04
     \]

   - **After Month 3**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 \times (1 + 0.02) = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208
     \]

4. **Final amount owed**: After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (rounded to two decimal places).

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:
   \[
   \boxed{106.12}
   \]

To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed, including the interest accrued over that period.

1. **Initial Amount Owed**: Mandy owes Benedict $100.

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: The interest rate is 2% per month. This means that each month, the amount owed increases by 2% of the current amount owed.

3. **Calculating Interest for Each Month**:
   - **Month 1**:
     - Interest for Month 1 = 2% of $100 = 0.02 × 100 = $2
     - Total Amount after Month 1 = $100 + $2 = $102

   - **Month 2**:
     - Interest for Month 2 = 2% of $102 = 0.02 × 102 = $2.04
     - Total Amount after Month 2 = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

   - **Month 3**:
     - Interest for Month 3 = 2% of $104.04 = 0.02 × 104.04 = $2.0808
     - Total Amount after Month 3 = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

4. **Final Amount Owed**: After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (rounded to two decimal places).

Thus, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**.
