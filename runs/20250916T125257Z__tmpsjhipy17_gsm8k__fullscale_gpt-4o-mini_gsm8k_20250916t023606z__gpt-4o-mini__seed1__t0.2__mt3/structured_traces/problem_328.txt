To determine how long it will take to fully charge the cell phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current charge and the target charge**: 
   - The phone is currently at 60% charge.
   - The target charge for a fully charged phone is 100%.

2. **Calculate the percentage of charge needed**:
   - To find out how much more charge is needed, we subtract the current charge from the target charge:
   \[
   \text{Charge needed} = 100\% - 60\% = 40\%
   \]

3. **Determine the charging rate**:
   - The phone recharges at a rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time needed to charge the remaining percentage**:
   - Since the phone needs to gain 40 percentage points, we can calculate the total time required by multiplying the number of percentage points needed by the time it takes to charge each percentage point:
   \[
   \text{Total time (in minutes)} = \text{Charge needed} \times \text{Time per percentage point}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time (in minutes)} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours**:
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide the total minutes by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   \text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the time it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100% is **2 hours**.

Final answer: **2 hours**.
