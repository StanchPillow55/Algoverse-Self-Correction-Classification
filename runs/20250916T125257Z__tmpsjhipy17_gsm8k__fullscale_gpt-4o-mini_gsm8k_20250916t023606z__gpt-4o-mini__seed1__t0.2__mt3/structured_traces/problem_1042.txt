To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then finding the average loss.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Let’s denote this loss as \( L_1 = -5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount he lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Therefore, the amount he won in the second race is:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Since he won $11 in the second race, we calculate 1.5 times that amount:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Now we will calculate the total amount lost. The total loss is the sum of the losses from the first and third races:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 = -5 + (-16.5) = -5 - 16.5 = -21.5
     \]

5. **Total Wins Calculation:**
   - The total amount won is simply the amount won in the second race:
     \[
     \text{Total Wins} = W_2 = 11
     \]

6. **Net Amount Calculation:**
   - To find the net amount, we can add the total wins to the total losses:
     \[
     \text{Net Amount} = \text{Total Wins} + \text{Total Loss} = 11 - 21.5 = -10.5
     \]
   - This means Johnny's dad lost a total of $10.5 after all three races.

7. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (which is 3):
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-21.5}{3} \approx -7.1667
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The average loss that Johnny's dad experienced that day is approximately:
     \[
     \boxed{7.17}
     \] 

Thus, Johnny's dad lost an average of about $7.17 per race.

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then find the average loss for the day.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Let’s denote this loss as \( L_1 = 5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount he lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Adding $1 to this gives us the winnings from the second race:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - The winnings from the second race are $11, so 1.5 times this amount is:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Now we can calculate the total amount lost by Johnny's dad throughout the day. The total loss is the sum of the losses from the first and third races:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5
     \]

5. **Total Races:**
   - There are a total of 3 races (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).

6. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{21.5}{3}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = 7.1667 \quad (\text{approximately})
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss for the day is:
     \[
     \boxed{7.17}
     \]

   - Let’s denote this loss as \( L_1 = -5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Adding $1 to this gives us the winnings in the second race:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - The winnings from the second race are $11, so 1.5 times that amount is:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Losses and Wins:**
   - Total losses:
     - From the first race: \( L_1 = -5 \)
     - From the third race: \( L_3 = -16.5 \)
   - Total winnings:
     - From the second race: \( W_2 = 11 \)

5. **Net Gain/Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the total amount lost, we sum the losses and subtract the winnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 + W_2 = -5 - 16.5 + 11
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     - First, sum the losses:
       \[
       -5 - 16.5 = -21.5
       \]
     - Then add the winnings:
       \[
       -21.5 + 11 = -10.5
       \]
   - Therefore, the total loss for the day is $10.5.

6. **Calculating the Average Loss:**
   - There are three races in total.
   - To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-10.5}{3}
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = -3.5
     \]

Thus, the average loss for Johnny's dad that day is **$3.50**. 

Final answer: **$3.50**.
