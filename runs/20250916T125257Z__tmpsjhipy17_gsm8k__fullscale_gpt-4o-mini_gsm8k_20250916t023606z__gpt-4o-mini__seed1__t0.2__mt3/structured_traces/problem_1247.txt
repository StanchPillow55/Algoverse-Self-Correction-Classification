Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles in his bag.

2. **Dropping Half of the Marbles**: When he trips, he drops half of the marbles. To find out how many he dropped, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles dropped} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]
   After dropping 5 marbles, the number of marbles left in the bag is:
   \[
   \text{Marbles left} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

3. **Searching for the Dropped Marbles**: Brendan searches for the marbles he dropped and finds 3 of them. So, he now has:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = \text{Marbles left in bag} + \text{Marbles found} = 5 + 3 = 8
   \]

4. **Identifying a Bead**: Upon inspecting the marbles further at home, he discovers that one of the marbles he found is actually a bead. Since he gets rid of the bead, we subtract 1 from the total number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Final count of marbles} = 8 - 1 = 7
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of marbles Brendan ended up with is:
   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]
