To solve the problem, we need to find the age of Wilfred given the ages of the other children and the conditions provided.

1. **Identify the known ages:**
   - Akbar's age = 3 years
   - Alessandro's age = 4 years
   - Helene's age = \( H \) (unknown)
   - Wilfred's age = \( W \) (unknown)

2. **Total age of the children:**
   The total age of all four children is given as 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   3 + 4 + H + W = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this, we find:
   \[
   7 + H + W = 20
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 20 - 7
   \]
   \[
   H + W = 13 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

3. **Helene's age in relation to the average age:**
   We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. First, we need to find the average age of the four children:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Since Helene is twice the average age:
   \[
   H = 2 \times 5 = 10 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

4. **Substituting Helene's age into Equation 1:**
   Now we substitute \( H = 10 \) into Equation 1:
   \[
   10 + W = 13
   \]
   Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   W = 13 - 10
   \]
   \[
   W = 3
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The age of Wilfred is \( \boxed{3} \).

6. **Verification:**
   Let's verify the calculations:
   - Ages: Akbar = 3, Alessandro = 4, Helene = 10, Wilfred = 3.
   - Total age: \( 3 + 4 + 10 + 3 = 20 \) (correct).
   - Average age: \( \frac{20}{4} = 5 \).
   - Helene's age: \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \) (correct).

Thus, all conditions are satisfied, and Wilfred's age is indeed \( \boxed{3} \).
