To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Cookies in a Bag**: Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.

   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 36
   \]

2. **Cookies for Son's Lunch**: Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box for 5 days a week. We need to calculate the total number of cookies she uses for her son's lunch.

   \[
   \text{Cookies for son's lunch} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Cookies for Husband**: Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days. We will calculate the total number of cookies he consumes.

   \[
   \text{Cookies for husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Total Cookies Consumed by Son and Husband**: Now, we will add the cookies consumed by her son and her husband to find the total number of cookies they eat.

   \[
   \text{Total cookies consumed by son and husband} = 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Cookies Left for Jenny**: To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we subtract the total cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total cookies in the bag.

   \[
   \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Total cookies consumed by son and husband}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies}
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of cookies that Jenny eats is:

   \[
   \boxed{9}
   \]
