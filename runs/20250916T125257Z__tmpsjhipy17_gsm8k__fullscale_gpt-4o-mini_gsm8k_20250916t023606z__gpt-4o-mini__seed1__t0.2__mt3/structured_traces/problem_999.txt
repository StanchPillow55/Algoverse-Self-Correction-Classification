To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids such that each adult receives a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( x \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids will be:

\[
\text{Total size for kids} = 4x
\]

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice will be:

\[
\text{Size of each adult's slice} = 2x
\]

With 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults will be:

\[
\text{Total size for adults} = 2 \times 2x = 4x
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size for the kids and the total size for the adults:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4x + 4x = 8x
\]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult receives. Since each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \), we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives as follows:

1. The size of each adult's slice is \( 2x \).
2. The total size of the watermelon is \( 8x \).

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is calculated by the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2x}{8x} \right) \times 100
\]

The \( x \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Finally, we can state our final answer:

Each adult gets **25%** of the watermelon.
