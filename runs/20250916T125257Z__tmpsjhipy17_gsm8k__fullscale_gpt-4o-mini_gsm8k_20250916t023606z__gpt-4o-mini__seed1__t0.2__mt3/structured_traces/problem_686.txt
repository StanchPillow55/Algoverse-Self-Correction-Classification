To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many cookies Greta bakes:**
   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes:**
   - Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta. 
   - Therefore, the number of cookies Celinda bakes is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda:**
   - To find the total number of cookies, we add the cookies baked by Greta and Celinda:
     \[
     30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Determine how many cookies they eat:**
   - Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.

5. **Calculate the number of cookies left after they eat some:**
   - To find the number of cookies left, we subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookies:
     \[
     90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The number of cookies that are in the box is:
     \[
     \boxed{80}
     \] 

Thus, after following all the steps and calculations, we conclude that there are 80 cookies in the box.
