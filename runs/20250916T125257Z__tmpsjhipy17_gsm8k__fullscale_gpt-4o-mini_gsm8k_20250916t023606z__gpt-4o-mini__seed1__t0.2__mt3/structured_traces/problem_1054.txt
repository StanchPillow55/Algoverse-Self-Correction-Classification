To determine the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor with square tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of tiles needed**:
   - The area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet (SqFt).
   - Each tile is square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is:
     \[
     \text{Area of one tile} = \text{side} \times \text{side} = 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}
     \]
   - To find the total number of tiles needed, we divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile:
     \[
     \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of kitchen}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost**:
   - The cost of each tile is given as $12.
   - To find the total cost for all the tiles, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor with new tiles is:
     \[
     \boxed{2400} \text{ dollars}
     \]
