To solve the problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided about John and their ages when Digimon was released.

1. **Identify Current Age of John**: 
   - We know that John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine the Time Since Digimon's Release**: 
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it was released 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate John's Age at the Time of Digimon's Release**: 
   - Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can find John's age at that time by subtracting 20 from his current age:
   \[
   \text{John's age at release} = 28 - 20 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Relationship Between John and Jim's Ages at the Time of Release**: 
   - The problem states that when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{John's age at release} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age at release}
   \]
   Substituting John's age at release:
   \[
   8 = 2 \times \text{Jim's age at release}
   \]

5. **Solve for Jim's Age at the Time of Release**: 
   - To find Jim's age at the time of Digimon's release, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \text{Jim's age at release} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
   \]

6. **Calculate Jim's Current Age**: 
   - Since Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can find Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at the time of release:
   \[
   \text{Jim's current age} = 4 + 20 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that Jim is currently **24 years old**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
