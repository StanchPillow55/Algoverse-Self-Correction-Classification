To solve the problem, we need to determine how many red roses Sandra ordered based on the information provided about her order of white carnations and pink calla lilies.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.

2. **Determine the Number of Red Roses**:
   - According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses ordered is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4x
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Pink Calla Lilies**:
   - The problem states that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     5x = 200
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find the number of white carnations, we solve the equation:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

5. **Calculate the Number of Red Roses**:
   - Now that we know \( x \), we can find the number of red roses:
     \[
     \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the missing red roses. The number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm is:
     \[
     \boxed{160}
     \] 

This completes the reasoning and calculations for the problem. Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses to fulfill Sandra's order.
