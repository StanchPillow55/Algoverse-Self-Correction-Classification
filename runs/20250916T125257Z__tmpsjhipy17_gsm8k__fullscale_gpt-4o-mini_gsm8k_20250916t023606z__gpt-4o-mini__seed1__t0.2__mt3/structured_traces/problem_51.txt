To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Tom to travel back after sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM. 

1. **Determine the time spent sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM:**
   - Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of:
     \[
     4 \text{ PM} - 1 \text{ PM} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the distance traveled during the first leg of the journey:**
   - Tom's speed during this leg is 10 miles per hour. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Determine the speed for the return trip:**
   - Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour.

4. **Calculate the time taken for the return trip:**
   - We need to find the time it takes to travel back the same distance of 30 miles at a speed of 6 mph. We can use the same distance formula rearranged to find time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values for the return trip:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, it takes Tom **5 hours** to get back.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]
