To solve the problem, we will calculate the total cost of pomegranates for both Clara and Sheila, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Clara's Total Cost

1. **Price per pomegranate**: $20
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
4. **Discount from voucher**: $2
5. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 400 - 2 = 398
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Sheila's Total Cost

1. **New price per pomegranate**: $30
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 30 \times 20 = 600
   \]
4. **Discount offered**: 10%
5. **Amount of discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total cost} \times \frac{10}{100} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 600 - 60 = 540
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Prices

Now we find the difference between the total prices paid by Clara and Sheila:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Sheila's total cost} - \text{Clara's total cost} = 540 - 398 = 142
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is \(\boxed{142}\).
