To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating each expense and donation Zaid makes from his monthly salary of $6000.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on rent:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel:**
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   First, we need to find out how much Zaid has left after paying for rent and car fuel.
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Rent} + \text{Car Fuel} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Salary} - \text{Total expenses} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount donated to charity:**
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to Charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the charity donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after donation} = \text{Remaining amount} - \text{Donation to Charity} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
   \]

6. **Calculate the amount given to his daughter:**
   Zaid gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after daughter} = 1250 - 200 = 1050
   \]

7. **Calculate the amount given to his wife:**
   Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and other household goods.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after wife} = 1050 - 700 = 350
   \]

8. **Final amount Zaid has left:**
   After all expenses and donations, Zaid has $350 left.
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 350
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]
