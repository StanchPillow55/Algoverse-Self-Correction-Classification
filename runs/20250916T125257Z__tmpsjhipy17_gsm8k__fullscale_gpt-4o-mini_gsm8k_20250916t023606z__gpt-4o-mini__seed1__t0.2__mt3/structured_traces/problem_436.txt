To solve the problem, we need to determine how much cake remains after Rory and her mom each take a piece from the original cake.

1. **Determine the weight of the entire cake**: 
   The cake weighs 20 ounces.

2. **Determine how many pieces the cake is cut into**: 
   The cake is cut into 8 pieces.

3. **Determine how many pieces are taken by Rory and her mom**: 
   Rory takes 1 piece and her mom takes 1 piece, so together they take:
   \[
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weight of one piece of cake**: 
   Since the cake is cut into 8 equal pieces, we can find the weight of one piece by dividing the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:
   \[
   \text{Weight of one piece} = \frac{\text{Total weight of cake}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the pieces taken by Rory and her mom**: 
   Since they take 2 pieces, the total weight of the pieces they take is:
   \[
   \text{Weight of pieces taken} = 2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces/piece} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining weight of the cake**: 
   To find the remaining weight of the cake after Rory and her mom have taken their pieces, we subtract the weight of the pieces taken from the total weight of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight of cake} = \text{Total weight of cake} - \text{Weight of pieces taken} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, the remaining weight of the cake is:
\[
\boxed{15} \text{ ounces}
\]
