To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of articles Meredith wrote each day and then the total hours she spent writing those articles.

1. **Calculate the number of articles written on each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than she wrote on Monday. To find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday, we first calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the articles written on Monday:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5
     \]
     \[
     = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]

   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Articles on Monday: 5
   - Articles on Tuesday: 7
   - Articles on Wednesday: 14
   - Total articles:
     \[
     \text{Total articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time spent on writing all articles is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Total articles} \times \text{Time per article}
     \]
     \[
     = 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Meredith spent a total of **104 hours** writing articles over the three days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
