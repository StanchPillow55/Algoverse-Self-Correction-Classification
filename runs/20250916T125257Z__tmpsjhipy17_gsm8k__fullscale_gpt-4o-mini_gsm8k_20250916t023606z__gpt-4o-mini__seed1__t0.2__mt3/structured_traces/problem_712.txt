To solve the problem, we need to determine how much candy Ginger and Amy each have after two weeks, and then find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.**
Two weeks consist of:
\[
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks.**
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
\[
4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.**
Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 56 pieces, the amount of candy she has left is:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.**
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, in 14 days, she will eat:
\[
3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.**
Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 42 pieces, the amount of candy she has left is:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 6: Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger.**
Now we need to find the difference in the amount of candy they have:
\[
58 \text{ pieces (Amy)} - 44 \text{ pieces (Ginger)} = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
