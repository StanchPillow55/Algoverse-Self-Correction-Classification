To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in both the students' and teachers' cars, and then determine how many windows Hannah smashes based on the given fractions.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows for students' cars.

1. **Number of students' cars**: 64
2. **Number of windows per students' car**: 4

To find the total number of windows for students' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for students' cars} = \text{Number of students' cars} \times \text{Number of windows per car}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows for students' cars} = 64 \times 4 = 256
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of windows for teachers' cars.

1. **Number of teachers' cars**: 32
2. **Number of windows per teachers' car**: 2

To find the total number of windows for teachers' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for teachers' cars} = \text{Number of teachers' cars} \times \text{Number of windows per car}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows for teachers' cars} = 32 \times 2 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

1. **Windows smashed from students' cars**: Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
   \[
   \text{Windows smashed from students' cars} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total windows for students' cars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Windows smashed from students' cars} = \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64
   \]

2. **Windows smashed from teachers' cars**: Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
   \[
   \text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total windows for teachers' cars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars} = \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of windows smashed.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars:

\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = \text{Windows smashed from students' cars} + \text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = 64 + 48 = 112
\]

### Final Answer

Hannah smashes a total of **112 windows**.
