To determine how many vlogs Emma needs to complete in order to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vlogs Emma has made so far.**
   - For the first week, she made 18 vlogs.
   - For the second week, she made 21 vlogs.
   - For the third week, she made 15 vlogs.

   We will add these numbers together:

   \[
   \text{Total vlogs made} = 18 + 21 + 15
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the vlogs from the first two weeks:
     \[
     18 + 21 = 39
     \]

   - Now, add the vlogs from the third week:
     \[
     39 + 15 = 54
     \]

   So, Emma has made a total of 54 vlogs so far.

2. **Determine how many more vlogs Emma needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs.**
   - We know her monthly goal is 72 vlogs, and she has already made 54 vlogs. We will subtract the number of vlogs she has made from her goal:

   \[
   \text{Vlogs needed} = 72 - 54
   \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:

   \[
   72 - 54 = 18
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
