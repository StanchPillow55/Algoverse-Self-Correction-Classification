To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**
2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**
3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**
4. **Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.**

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem:
\[
\text{Adrien's salary} = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
\]

Calculating \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000
\]
\[
= 40000 + 16000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

Since the problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, so we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage.

Letâ€™s calculate Lylah's salary increase. Since we do not have a specific percentage increase for Lylah, we will assume it is the same as Adrien's increase of 40% for simplicity.

Calculating Lylah's salary four years later:
\[
\text{Lylah's salary four years later} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \):
\[
= 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.

Now we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's salary four years later} + \text{Lylah's salary four years later}
\]
\[
= 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine Lylah's salary and then calculate both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's Salary

We know that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's salary be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem, Adrien's salary \( A \) can be expressed as:
\[
A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
A = 40000
\]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can solve for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later \( A' \) can be calculated as:
\[
A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
\]
Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
\[
A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's Salary Four Years Later

Since the problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, and we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's increase (40%).

Thus, Lylah's salary four years later \( L' \) can be calculated as:
\[
L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
\[
L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later

Now we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total Salary} = A' + L' = 56000 + 43076.92
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Total Salary} \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago**:
   We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

   Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   where \( A \) is Adrien's salary. Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
   \[
   40000 = 1.3L
   \]
   To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 1.3:
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
   \]
   So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

2. **Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later**:
   We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Thus, his salary four years later can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{New Adrien's Salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's Salary Four Years Later**:
   The problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. However, we do not know the exact percentage increase for Lylah. We will denote Lylah's salary increase as \( x \) percent.

   Lylah's salary four years later can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{New Lylah's Salary} = L + \frac{x}{100}L = L(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]
   Since we do not have the value of \( x \), we will keep it in this form for now.

4. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later**:
   The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = \text{New Adrien's Salary} + \text{New Lylah's Salary}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + L(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]
   We already calculated \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + 30769.23(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]

5. **Assuming Lylah's Salary Increase**:
   Since we do not have the exact percentage increase for Lylah, we can assume that her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%. Thus, we can set \( x = 40 \):
   \[
   \text{New Lylah's Salary} = 30769.23(1 + 0.4) = 30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
   \]

6. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later**:
   Now we can calculate the total salary:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately:
   \[
   \boxed{99076.92}
   \]
