To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each person after applying their respective discounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost.**

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. 

First, we calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[
\text{Total cost for Becky} = \text{Number of apples} \times \text{Cost per apple} = 20 \times 0.45 = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we apply the $1 discount:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount for Becky} = 9 - 1 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost.**

Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.

First, we calculate the total cost before the discount:
\[
\text{Total cost for Kelly} = \text{Number of apples} \times \text{Cost per apple} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we apply the 10% discount. To find the amount of the discount, we calculate 10% of the total cost:
\[
\text{Discount amount} = 10\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount for Kelly} = 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the total costs.**

Now we need to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost for Kelly} - \text{Total cost for Becky} = 9 - 8 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Kelly paid **$1** more than Becky.
