To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours, and then apply the appropriate rates for each.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours**:
   - Eliza works a total of 45 hours this week.
   - The first 40 hours are considered regular hours.
   - The hours worked beyond 40 hours are considered overtime hours.
   - Therefore, the overtime hours she worked are:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours} - \text{Regular Hours} = 45 - 40 = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate Regular Earnings**:
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - For the first 40 hours, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Earnings**:
   - Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Therefore, her overtime rate is:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Regular Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]
   - For the 5 hours of overtime, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings**:
   - To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = 400 + 60 = 460 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are \(\boxed{460}\) dollars.
