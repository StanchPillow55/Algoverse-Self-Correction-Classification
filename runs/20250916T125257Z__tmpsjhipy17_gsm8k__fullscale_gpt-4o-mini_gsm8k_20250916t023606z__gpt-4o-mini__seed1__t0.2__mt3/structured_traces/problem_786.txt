To find out how many fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we need to calculate the total yield from both the tomato plants and the eggplant plants separately, and then sum these yields.

**Step 1: Calculate the yield from the tomato plants.**

Ricardo has 5 tomato plants, and each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes. We can calculate the total number of tomatoes by multiplying the number of plants by the yield per plant:

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = \text{Number of tomato plants} \times \text{Yield per tomato plant}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total tomatoes} = 5 \times 22
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
5 \times 22 = 110
\]

So, Ricardo will get **110 tomatoes** from his tomato plants.

**Step 2: Calculate the yield from the eggplant plants.**

Ricardo has 8 eggplant plants, and each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants. We can calculate the total number of eggplants by multiplying the number of plants by the yield per plant:

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = \text{Number of eggplant plants} \times \text{Yield per eggplant plant}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total eggplants} = 8 \times 4
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
8 \times 4 = 32
\]

So, Ricardo will get **32 eggplants** from his eggplant plants.

**Step 3: Calculate the total yield of fruits.**

Now, we need to find the total number of fruits (both tomatoes and eggplants) by adding the total number of tomatoes and the total number of eggplants:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Total tomatoes} + \text{Total eggplants}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = 110 + 32
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
110 + 32 = 142
\]

Thus, the total number of fruits that Ricardo can get from his plants is **142**.

**Final Answer: 142 fruits**.
