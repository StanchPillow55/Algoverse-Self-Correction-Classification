To solve the problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will follow the information given step by step.

1. **Determine Albert's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Albert is 36 inches tall.

2. **Determine Anne's height**: 
   The problem states that Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine Jackie's height after summer**: 
   The problem states that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Therefore, we can calculate Jackie's height after summer:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height after summer} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine Jackie's height before summer**: 
   We know that Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her height after summer:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's height after summer} - 3 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches} - 3 \text{ inches} = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Jackie's height before summer was **67 inches**.

Final answer: Jackie was 67 inches tall before summer.
