Let \( H \) represent the number of copies that Harald sold. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. Therefore, we can express the number of copies Marilyn sold as \( 10H \).

The total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is given as 88,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000
\]

Now, we can combine the terms on the left side of the equation:

\[
11H = 88,000
\]

Next, we will solve for \( H \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
H = 8,000
\]

Thus, Harald sold \( 8,000 \) copies.

To verify, we can calculate how many copies Marilyn sold:

\[
10H = 10 \times 8,000 = 80,000
\]

Now, we check the total:

\[
H + 10H = 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000
\]

Since this matches the total given in the problem, our solution is confirmed.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8000}
\]
