To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount the customer paid on their shopping trip.

### Step 1: Calculate Rewards Earned
The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent. On their last shopping trip, they spent $80.

1. Calculate the number of $20 increments in $80:
   \[
   \text{Number of increments} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
   \]
2. Therefore, the total rewards earned from this shopping trip is:
   \[
   \text{Rewards} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Spent on the Current Shopping Trip
On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.

### Step 3: Apply Rewards to the Current Purchase
The customer has $4 in rewards from their previous shopping trip. They will use these rewards on their current purchase.

1. Subtract the rewards from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Amount after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 4: Apply the Coupon
The customer has a coupon that takes off twice the amount of rewards. Since they have $4 in rewards, the coupon will take off:
\[
\text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Final Amount Paid
Now, we subtract the coupon discount from the amount after applying the rewards:
\[
\text{Final amount paid} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion
The customer paid a total of **$31** on this shopping trip.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty card rules, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent.

   \[
   \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   So, the customer has $4 in rewards.

2. **Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.

3. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   The customer has $4 in rewards, which they can use to reduce the cost of their current purchase. However, the problem states that they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

   \[
   \text{Total discount from rewards and coupon} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the final amount paid after applying the discount:**
   Now, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = \text{Amount spent} - \text{Total discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = 43 - 8 = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the customer paid **$35** on this shopping trip.

Final answer: **$35**

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty program, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent. 

   \[
   \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
   \]

   Therefore, the customer earned **$4 in rewards**.

2. **Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip.

3. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   The customer has $4 in rewards. They can use this to reduce the price of their current purchase. 

   \[
   \text{Price after applying rewards} = \text{Amount spent} - \text{Rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39
   \]

   So, after applying the rewards, the price is **$39**.

4. **Apply the coupon:**
   The problem states that the customer applied a coupon that took **twice the amount of rewards off the price**. Since the customer has $4 in rewards, the coupon will take:

   \[
   \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the final amount the customer pays:**
   Now we subtract the coupon discount from the price after applying the rewards:

   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Price after applying rewards} - \text{Coupon discount} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Thus, the customer pays **$31** on this shopping trip.

**Final Answer: $31**
