To determine how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

1. **Daily production of bars**: The company produces 5000 bars per day.
2. **Number of days in two weeks**: There are 14 days in two weeks (since 1 week = 7 days).
3. **Total production in two weeks**: 
   \[
   \text{Total bars} = \text{Daily production} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bars} = 5000 \, \text{bars/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 70000 \, \text{bars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

1. **Selling price per bar**: The company sells each bar for $2.
2. **Total revenue from selling all bars**:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total bars} \times \text{Selling price per bar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 70000 \, \text{bars} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/bar} = 140000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

The company will receive **$140,000** for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

To determine how much money the company will receive from selling chocolate bars over two weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of bars produced in one day**:  
   The company produces 5000 bars per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks**:  
   There are 14 days in two weeks.  
   Total bars produced in two weeks = Number of bars produced per day × Number of days in two weeks  
   \[
   \text{Total bars} = 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars**:  
   The company sells each bar for $2.  
   Total revenue = Total number of bars × Price per bar  
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the company will receive a total of **$140,000** for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

**Final Answer**: $140,000
