To find out how much each watermelon was sold for, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost price per watermelon**: 
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost price (CP) per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

   \[
   \text{Cost Price per Watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Cost Price per Watermelon} = 1.6
   \]

   So, the cost price per watermelon is $1.60.

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a profit of 25%**:
   The vendor sells the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price (SP) per watermelon, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and then add that to the cost price.

   First, we calculate 25% of the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 25\% \text{ of Cost Price} = 0.25 \times 1.6
   \]

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.4
   \]

   Now, we add the profit to the cost price to find the selling price:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = \text{Cost Price} + \text{Profit} = 1.6 + 0.4
   \]

   \[
   \text{Selling Price per Watermelon} = 2.0
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   The selling price of each watermelon is $2.00.

Thus, the final answer is that each watermelon was sold for **$2.00**.
