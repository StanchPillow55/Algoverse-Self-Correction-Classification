To find out how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total time Vince was stapling reports.**
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a span of time that we need to calculate.
   - From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon) is 4 hours.
   - From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours.
   - Therefore, the total time from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 11 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Convert the total time into minutes.**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
     \[
     15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine how many reports Vince can staple in one minute.**
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples in one minute, we divide the number of reports by the number of minutes:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ reports}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 2 \text{ reports/minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled in 900 minutes.**
   - Now that we know Vince staples 2 reports per minute, we can find the total number of reports stapled in 900 minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ reports/minute} \times 900 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ reports}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total number of reports that Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM is:
     \[
     \boxed{1800}
     \]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many reports Vince can staple in the given time frame from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time Vince worked

First, we need to find out how many hours there are from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM.

- From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM (noon) is 4 hours.
- From 12:00 PM to 11:00 PM is 11 hours.

Now, we add these two time periods together:

\[
4 \text{ hours} + 11 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Convert hours to minutes

Next, we convert the total hours into minutes since Vince staples reports every 15 minutes.

\[
15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes

Now, we need to find out how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes.

\[
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports stapled

Since Vince can staple 30 reports in each 15-minute interval, we can calculate the total number of reports stapled by multiplying the number of intervals by the number of reports per interval:

\[
60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of reports that Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]
