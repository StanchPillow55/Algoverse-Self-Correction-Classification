To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial Situation**:
   - There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Cars Driving Through**:
   - We know that some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
   - After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through in the next 15 minutes.

3. **Cars Taking an Exit**:
   - During the traffic jam, 5 cars take an exit to avoid the jam.

4. **Setting Up the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes.
   - After the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars drive through, which means a total of \( x + 20 \) cars have driven through by the end of the 30 minutes.

5. **Calculating Remaining Cars**:
   - Since 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that remain in the traffic jam after the exit is \( 30 - 5 = 25 \).
   - Therefore, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam (both in the first and second 15 minutes) must equal the number of cars that were originally there minus those that took the exit:
     \[
     x + 20 = 30 - 5
     \]
     \[
     x + 20 = 25
     \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{5} \).
