To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John and Jack have left to reach school after walking to the library and the fire station.

1. **Total Time Available**: John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.

2. **Time to the Library**: It takes them 6 minutes to walk to the library.

3. **Time from the Library to the Fire Station**: After reaching the library, it takes them another 13 minutes to walk to the fire station.

4. **Total Time Spent Walking to the Fire Station**:
   - Time to the library: 6 minutes
   - Time from the library to the fire station: 13 minutes
   - Total time spent = 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes

5. **Time Remaining to Get to School**:
   - Total time available: 30 minutes
   - Time spent walking to the fire station: 19 minutes
   - Time remaining = Total time available - Time spent walking
   - Time remaining = 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes

Thus, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

**Final Answer**: They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.
