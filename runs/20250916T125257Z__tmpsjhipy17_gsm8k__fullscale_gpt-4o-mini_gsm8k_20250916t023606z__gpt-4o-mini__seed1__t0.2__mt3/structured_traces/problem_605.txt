To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we will break down the problem into two parts: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours

1. **Cups sold per hour**: 15 cups
2. **Price per cup**: $0.50
3. **Total hours**: 4 hours

**Total cups sold in the first 4 hours**:
\[
\text{Total cups} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

**Total earnings from the first 4 hours**:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Total cups} \times \text{Price per cup} = 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours

1. **Cups sold per hour**: 10 cups
2. **Price per cup**: $0.60
3. **Total hours**: 2 hours

**Total cups sold in the next 2 hours**:
\[
\text{Total cups} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

**Total earnings from the next 2 hours**:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Total cups} \times \text{Price per cup} = 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for the 6 hours

Now, we will add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings for the 6 hours.

**Total earnings**:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from first 4 hours} + \text{Earnings from next 2 hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Patrick earned a total of **$42** from selling lemonade for 6 hours.

To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6 hours, we will break the problem down into two parts: the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours

1. **Cups sold per hour**: 15 cups
2. **Price per cup**: $0.50
3. **Total hours**: 4 hours

First, we calculate the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
\[
\text{Total cups sold in 4 hours} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total hours} = 15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from these cups:
\[
\text{Total earnings from first 4 hours} = \text{Total cups sold} \times \text{Price per cup} = 60 \text{ cups} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/cup} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours

1. **Cups sold per hour**: 10 cups
2. **Price per cup**: $0.60
3. **Total hours**: 2 hours

Now, we calculate the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours:
\[
\text{Total cups sold in 2 hours} = \text{Cups per hour} \times \text{Total hours} = 10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, we calculate the total earnings from these cups:
\[
\text{Total earnings from next 2 hours} = \text{Total cups sold} \times \text{Price per cup} = 20 \text{ cups} \times 0.60 \text{ dollars/cup} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for 6 hours

Now, we add the earnings from both parts to find the total earnings for the 6 hours:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from first 4 hours} + \text{Earnings from next 2 hours} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount of money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours is:
\[
\boxed{42} \text{ dollars}
\]
