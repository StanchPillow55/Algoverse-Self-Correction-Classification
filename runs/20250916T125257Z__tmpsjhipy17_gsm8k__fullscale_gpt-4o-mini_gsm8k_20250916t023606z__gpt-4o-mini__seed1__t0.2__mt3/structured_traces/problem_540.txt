To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Sharing of $18 Among 3 Boys**:
   Let's denote the shares of the three boys as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Since the total amount shared is $18, we have:
   \[
   a + b + c = 18
   \]
   For simplicity, let's assume that each boy initially gets an equal share. Therefore:
   \[
   a = b = c = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   So, each boy initially receives $6.

2. **Eldest Boy's Transactions**:
   The eldest boy (let's say he is the one with share \( a \)) adds $5 to his share:
   \[
   a + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
   \]
   The next day, he adds another $10:
   \[
   11 + 10 = 21
   \]
   So, after these additions, the eldest boy has $21.

3. **Spending $8**:
   The eldest boy then spends $8 from his total:
   \[
   21 - 8 = 13
   \]
   After spending, he has $13 left.

4. **Tripling the Amount Left**:
   The problem states that he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \times 13 = 39
   \]
   This means he now has $39 after saving some more.

5. **Final Amount**:
   The final amount the eldest boy has now is $39.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{39}
\]
