To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the total number of books:**
   - The total number of books is the sum of the books each person has:
     \[
     \text{Total books} = \text{Books by Dolly} + \text{Books by Pandora} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]

3. **Consider the reading scenario:**
   - Dolly reads her own 2 books.
   - Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
   - Therefore, Dolly reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Books read by Dolly} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]

   - Pandora reads her own 1 book.
   - Pandora also reads both of Dolly's 2 books.
   - Therefore, Pandora reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Books read by Pandora} = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of books read:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora. However, we must ensure we do not double-count any books.
   - Since Dolly reads all 3 books (2 of her own and 1 of Pandora's), and Pandora also reads all 3 books (1 of her own and 2 of Dolly's), we can conclude that they are reading the same set of books.

5. **Final count of unique books read:**
   - The unique books being read are the same 3 books (2 from Dolly and 1 from Pandora). Therefore, we do not need to add the counts of books read by each person separately since they are reading the same books.

Thus, the total number of unique books read collectively by Dolly and Pandora is:
\[
\text{Total unique books read} = 3
\]

**Final Answer:**
Dolly and Pandora will collectively read **3 books** by the end.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - Total books = Books owned by Dolly + Books owned by Pandora
   - Total books = 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

3. **Determine the reading scenario:**
   - According to the problem, both Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books as well as their own.
   - This means:
     - Dolly will read her 2 books and also read Pandora's 1 book.
     - Pandora will read her 1 book and also read both of Dolly's 2 books.

4. **Count the total number of readings:**
   - Dolly reads: 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
   - Pandora reads: 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

5. **Collectively, how many books are read?**
   - Since both Dolly and Pandora are reading the same books, we need to consider the unique books read rather than counting each reading separately.
   - The total number of unique books is 3 (as calculated in step 2).

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, by the end, they will collectively read 3 unique books.

Thus, the final answer is **3 books**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively by the end, given the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the reading scenario:**
   - Both Dolly and Pandora read their own books.
   - Additionally, they read each other's books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books read by each person:**
   - **Dolly's reading:**
     - Dolly reads her 2 books.
     - Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
     - Total books read by Dolly = 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.

   - **Pandora's reading:**
     - Pandora reads her 1 book.
     - Pandora also reads both of Dolly's 2 books.
     - Total books read by Pandora = 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

4. **Calculate the total number of books read collectively:**
   - Total books read by Dolly = 3
   - Total books read by Pandora = 3
   - Total books read collectively = 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.

5. **Final answer:**
   - By the end, Dolly and Pandora will have collectively read **6 books**.

Thus, the final answer is **6 books**.
