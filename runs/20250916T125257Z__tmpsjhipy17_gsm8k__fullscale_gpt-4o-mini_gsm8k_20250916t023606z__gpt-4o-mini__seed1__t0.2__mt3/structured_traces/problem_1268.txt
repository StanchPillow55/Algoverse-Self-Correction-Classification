To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower based on the information given about the blue and yellow blocks.

1. **Identify the number of blue blocks**: 
   The problem states that there are 4 blue blocks.

2. **Determine the number of yellow blocks**: 
   It is given that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks**: 
   Now, we can find the total number of blue and yellow blocks combined:
   \[
   \text{Total blue and yellow blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of blocks in the tower**: 
   The problem states that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

5. **Set up the equation for the number of red blocks**: 
   Let \( r \) represent the number of red blocks. The total number of blocks can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks}
   \]
   Substituting the known values into the equation gives:
   \[
   32 = 4 + 8 + r
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**: 
   Combine the known quantities on the right side:
   \[
   32 = 12 + r
   \]

7. **Solve for \( r \)**: 
   To find the number of red blocks, we isolate \( r \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
   \[
   r = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of red blocks in the tower is \( \boxed{20} \).
