To solve the problem, we will first define the points scored by each student based on the information given.

1. **Identify the points scored by Naomi**:
   - Naomi scored \( N = 68 \) points.

2. **Calculate the points scored by Yuri**:
   - According to the problem, Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
   - Half of Naomi's score is \( \frac{N}{2} = \frac{68}{2} = 34 \).
   - Therefore, Yuri's score \( Y \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   Y = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the points scored by Brianna**:
   - Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.
   - Therefore, Brianna's score \( B \) is:
   \[
   B = N + 17 = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Calculate the total points scored by all students**:
   - The total points scored by all four students is given as 251 points.
   - We can express this as:
   \[
   N + Y + B + J = 251
   \]
   where \( J \) is the score of Jojo.

5. **Substituting the known values into the equation**:
   - We substitute \( N \), \( Y \), and \( B \) into the equation:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 + J = 251
   \]

6. **Calculate the sum of the known scores**:
   - First, we add \( 68 + 44 + 85 \):
   \[
   68 + 44 = 112
   \]
   \[
   112 + 85 = 197
   \]

7. **Substituting back into the equation**:
   - Now we have:
   \[
   197 + J = 251
   \]

8. **Solve for Jojo's score**:
   - To find \( J \), we subtract 197 from both sides:
   \[
   J = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored \( \boxed{54} \) points.
