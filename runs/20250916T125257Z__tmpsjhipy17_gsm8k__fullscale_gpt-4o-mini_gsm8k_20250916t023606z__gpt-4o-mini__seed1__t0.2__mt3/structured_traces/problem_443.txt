To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon, and then determine how long James took to run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time
Jon's times for each segment of the triathlon are as follows:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

Now, we can calculate Jon's total time:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = \text{Swim} + \text{Bike} + \text{Run}
\]
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time
James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find out how long it takes James to swim, we first need to determine what 10% faster means in terms of time.

If Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, then 10% of that time is:
\[
10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.1 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]
Since James is faster, he takes 4 minutes less than Jon:
\[
\text{James's swim time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Since Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, we calculate James's bike time as follows:
\[
\text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time Without the Run
Now we can calculate James's total time for the swim and bike:
\[
\text{Total time for James (swim + bike)} = \text{James's swim time} + \text{James's bike time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time for James (swim + bike)} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Determine Jon's Winning Time
According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that James's total time for the triathlon is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = \text{Jon's total time} + 10
\]
\[
\text{James's total time} = 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate James's Run Time
Now we can find out how long James took to run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:
\[
\text{James's run time} = \text{James's total time} - \text{Total time for James (swim + bike)}
\]
\[
\text{James's run time} = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[
\boxed{59 \text{ minutes}}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon and then determine how long James took for the run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time
- **Swim:** 40 minutes
- **Bike:** 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- **Run:** 50 minutes

Now, we add these times together to find Jon's total time:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time
James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first need to determine how long it would take Jon to swim 100% of the distance. If Jon takes 40 minutes, then James's time can be calculated as follows:

- **10% faster means:** James's time = Jon's time × (1 - 0.10) = Jon's time × 0.90
\[
\text{James's swim time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:
\[
\text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time
Let \( R \) be the time it takes James to run. Then, James's total time is:
\[
\text{Total time for James} = \text{James's swim time} + \text{James's bike time} + R
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Total time for James} = 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation
We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = \text{Total time for James} + 10
\]
Substituting the total times:
\[
170 = (121 + R) + 10
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
170 = 131 + R
\]
Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[
R = 170 - 131 = 39 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
James took **39 minutes** to do the run.

To solve the problem, we will first calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon and then determine James's total time based on the information given.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time

1. **Swim Time**: 40 minutes
2. **Bike Time**: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. **Run Time**: 50 minutes

Now, we add these times together to find Jon's total time:

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = \text{Swim Time} + \text{Bike Time} + \text{Run Time}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Total Time

1. **Swim Time**: James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since James is faster, we subtract this from Jon's swim time:

\[
\text{James's Swim Time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

2. **Bike Time**: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:

\[
\text{James's Bike Time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Run Time**: Let \( r \) be the time it takes James to run. We will find \( r \) later.

### Step 3: Calculate James's Total Time

Now we can express James's total time as:

\[
\text{Total Time for James} = \text{James's Swim Time} + \text{James's Bike Time} + \text{James's Run Time}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time for James} = 36 + 85 + r = 121 + r \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Compare Times

According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes. This means:

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = \text{Total Time for James} + 10
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
170 = (121 + r) + 10
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \)

Now we simplify the equation:

\[
170 = 131 + r
\]

Subtract 131 from both sides:

\[
r = 170 - 131 = 39 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:

\[
\boxed{39 \text{ minutes}}
\]
