To find out how many square feet the quilt will be, we need to calculate the total area of fabric from the small, medium, and large t-shirts that Octavia is using. We will do this by multiplying the number of each size of t-shirt by the area each size provides, and then summing these areas together.

1. **Calculate the area from small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt provides 3 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
   - The total area from small t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = 11 \text{ shirts} \times 3 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 33 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area from medium t-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt provides 4 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
   - The total area from medium t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = 8 \text{ shirts} \times 4 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 32 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area from large t-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt provides 6 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
   - The total area from large t-shirts is:
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = 6 \text{ shirts} \times 6 \text{ square feet/shirt} = 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Sum the areas from all t-shirts:**
   - Now we will add the areas from small, medium, and large t-shirts together:
     \[
     \text{Total area} = \text{Area from small t-shirts} + \text{Area from medium t-shirts} + \text{Area from large t-shirts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 33 \text{ square feet} + 32 \text{ square feet} + 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 101 \text{ square feet}
     \]

Thus, the total area of the quilt that Octavia will make is **101 square feet**. 

Final answer: **101 square feet**.
