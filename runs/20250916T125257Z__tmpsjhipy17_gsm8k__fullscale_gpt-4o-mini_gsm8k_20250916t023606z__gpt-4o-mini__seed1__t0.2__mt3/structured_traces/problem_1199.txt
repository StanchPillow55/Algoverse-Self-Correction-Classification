To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each day and then determine how much each person can drink at the party.

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After the Children Drank Some:**
   Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie Spilled Some:**
   On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Barbie} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie Took Some:**
   On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Ronnie} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Amount Available for the Party:**
   On the fourth day, there are 8 gallons of root beer left. There are 3 people (Fred and 2 others) at the party.

   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3
   \]

   To find out how much root beer each person can drink, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer during the party.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Each person can drink } \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons of root beer.}
\]

To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each event leading up to the party.

1. **Initial amount of root beer**: Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After children drank some**: The children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After wife spilled some**: Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After friend drank some**: Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after friend} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Number of people at the party**: There are 3 guests plus Fred, making a total of 4 people.
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

6. **Amount of root beer available per person**: We divide the remaining root beer by the number of people.
   \[
   \text{Root beer per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink **2 gallons** of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink 2 gallons of root beer.

To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has over the four days, accounting for the losses each day.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **Day 1**: 
   - Amount before children drank: 24 gallons
   - Amount drunk by children: 4 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 1: 
     \[
     24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Day 2**:
   - Amount before spill: 20 gallons
   - Amount spilled by Barbie: 7 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 2: 
     \[
     20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Day 3**:
   - Amount before friend drank: 13 gallons
   - Amount drunk by Ronnie: 5 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 3: 
     \[
     13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Day 4**:
   - Amount before the party: 8 gallons
   - Number of people at the party: 3 (Fred and 2 others)
   - Amount of root beer available for each person:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.
