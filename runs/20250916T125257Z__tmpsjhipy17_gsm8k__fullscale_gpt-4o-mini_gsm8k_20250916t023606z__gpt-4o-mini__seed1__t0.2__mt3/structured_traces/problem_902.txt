To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - The price of each notebook is $1.50.
   - To find the total cost of the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks by the price per notebook:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = \text{Number of notebooks} \times \text{Price per notebook}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 7.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the ballpen:**
   - William bought 1 ballpen.
   - The price of each ballpen is $0.50.
   - To find the total cost of the ballpen, we multiply the number of ballpens by the price per ballpen:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = \text{Number of ballpens} \times \text{Price per ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 0.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now we add the total cost of the notebooks and the total cost of the ballpen together:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 7.50 + 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 8.00
   \]

Thus, William spent a total of **$8.00**. 

Final answer: **$8.00**.
