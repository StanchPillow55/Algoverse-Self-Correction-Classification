To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos, we will first calculate the daily revenue from both products and then find the percentage increase.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day at a price of $100 per tractor. 

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = \text{Number of Tractors Sold} \times \text{Price per Tractor}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at a price of $220 per silo.

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = \text{Number of Silos Sold} \times \text{Price per Silo}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.

Now, we find the increase in daily revenue by subtracting the revenue from tractors from the revenue from silos.

\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} - \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}
\]
\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in revenue.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Revenue}}{\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Final Answer

The factory is making **10% more** per day now by selling silos compared to when they were selling tractors.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the daily revenue from both the tractors and the silos, and then determine the percentage increase in revenue.

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day = 10
   - Price per tractor = $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = Number of tractors × Price per tractor
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day = 5
   - Price per silo = $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = Number of silos × Price per silo
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue:**
   - Increase in revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   \[
   \text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in revenue:**
   - Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Daily revenue from tractors) × 100%
   \[
   \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{100}{1000}\right) \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the factory is making **10% more** per day now compared to when they were making tractors.

**Final Answer:** 10% more

To find out how much more the factory is making per day now compared to when they were making tractors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day = 10
   - Revenue per tractor = $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = Number of tractors × Revenue per tractor
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day = 5
   - Revenue per silo = $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = Number of silos × Revenue per silo
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue:**
   - Increase in revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   \[
   \text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:**
   - Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Daily revenue from tractors) × 100%
   \[
   \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{100}{1000}\right) \times 100\% = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the factory is making **10% more** per day now than when they were making tractors.

**Final Answer:** 10% more per day.
