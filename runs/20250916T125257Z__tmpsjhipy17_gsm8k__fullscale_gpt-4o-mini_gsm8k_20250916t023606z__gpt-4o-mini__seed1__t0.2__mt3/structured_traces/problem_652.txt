To solve the problem, we need to break down the time James hires the carriage and calculate the cost based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **Determine the total time hired**: 
   James hires the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM. 
   - Total time = 9 PM - 5 PM = 4 hours.

2. **Account for the free hour**: 
   James gets 1 hour free. 
   - Paid hours = Total hours - Free hour = 4 hours - 1 hour = 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the cost for the paid hours**:
   - The first paid hour costs $15.
   - Each hour after the first is twice the cost of the first hour.
   - Therefore, the cost for the second hour is: 
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The cost for the third hour is also:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum the costs**:
   - Total cost = Cost of first hour + Cost of second hour + Cost of third hour
   - Total cost = $15 + $30 + $30
   - Total cost = $15 + $60 = $75.

Thus, the total amount James paid for hiring the horse-drawn carriage is:

\[
\boxed{75} \text{ dollars}
\]
