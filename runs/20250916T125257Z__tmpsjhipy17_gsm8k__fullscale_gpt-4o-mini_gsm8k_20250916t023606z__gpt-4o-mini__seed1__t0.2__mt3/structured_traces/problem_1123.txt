To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then sum these weights to find the total.

1. **Identify the weight of Kory's dog**: 
   Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog**: 
   Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. 
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog**: 
   Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. 
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs**: 
   Now we add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = \text{Weight of first dog} + \text{Weight of second dog} = 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of all dogs**: 
   Finally, we add the weight of Kory's dog to the total weight of Elijah's dogs.
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 60 \text{ pounds} + 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory’s dogs altogether is \( \boxed{105} \) pounds.
