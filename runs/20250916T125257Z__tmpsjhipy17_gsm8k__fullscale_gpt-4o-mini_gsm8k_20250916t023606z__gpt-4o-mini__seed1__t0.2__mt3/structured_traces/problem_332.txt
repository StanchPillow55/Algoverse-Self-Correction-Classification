To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of ruined castles:**
   We know that there are a total of 220 castles in Scotland, and 40 percent of them are ruins. To find the number of ruined castles, we calculate 40 percent of 220.

   \[
   \text{Number of ruined castles} = 40\% \text{ of } 220 = \frac{40}{100} \times 220
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \frac{40}{100} \times 220 = 0.4 \times 220 = 88
   \]

   So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

2. **Determine the number of unmanned ruined castles:**
   Next, we are told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find the number of unmanned ruined castles, we take half of the 88 ruined castles.

   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = \frac{1}{2} \times 88
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is:

   \[
   \boxed{44}
   \]
