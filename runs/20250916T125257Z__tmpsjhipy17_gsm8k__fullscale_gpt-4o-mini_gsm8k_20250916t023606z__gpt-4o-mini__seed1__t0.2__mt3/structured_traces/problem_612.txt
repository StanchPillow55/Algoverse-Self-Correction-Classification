To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we will calculate the amount of meat eaten by each player and then sum these amounts.

1. **First Player:**
   - The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   - Amount of meat = 6 ounces.

2. **Second Player:**
   - The second player ate beef tips, with each beef tip weighing 1 ounce.
   - The second player had 8 beef tips.
   - Amount of meat = 8 tips × 1 ounce/tip = 8 ounces.

3. **Third Player:**
   - The third player ate a one-pound steak.
   - We need to convert pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - Amount of meat = 1 pound × 16 ounces/pound = 16 ounces.

4. **Fourth and Fifth Players:**
   - The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, which means they did not consume any meat.
   - Amount of meat = 0 ounces for each of these players.
   - Total for both = 0 ounces + 0 ounces = 0 ounces.

Now, we will sum the amounts of meat consumed by all players:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = \text{First Player} + \text{Second Player} + \text{Third Player} + \text{Fourth Player} + \text{Fifth Player}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} + 0 \text{ ounces} + 0 \text{ ounces}
\]

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = 6 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team is **30 ounces**. 

Final answer: **30 ounces**.
