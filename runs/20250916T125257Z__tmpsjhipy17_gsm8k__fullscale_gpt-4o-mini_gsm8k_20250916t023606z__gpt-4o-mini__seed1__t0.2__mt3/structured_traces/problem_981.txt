To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the amount of crawfish Joe caught on each day:**
   - On **Thursday**, Joe caught **3 pounds** of crawfish.
   - On **Friday**, he caught **4 times** the amount he caught on Thursday. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times \text{Thursday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - On **Saturday**, he caught **half** the amount of his Friday's catch. Thus, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Friday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of crawfish caught over the three days:**
   - Now, we sum the amounts caught on each day:
     \[
     \text{Total catch} = \text{Thursday's catch} + \text{Friday's catch} + \text{Saturday's catch}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of servings:**
   - We know that **1 serving** of crawfish is **3 pounds**. To find the number of servings Joe has, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:
     \[
     \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Joe has a total of **7 servings** of crawfish.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
