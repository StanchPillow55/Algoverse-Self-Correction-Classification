To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the pension structure**: 
   - Marcy's full pension after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the years of service**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years.
   - She becomes entitled to the 5% pension increment after 20 years. Therefore, the number of years she is entitled to this increment is:
     \[
     30 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total increment**:
   - For each of these 10 years, she receives an additional 5% of the pension value. 
   - The value of the pension is $50,000, so 5% of this value is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Over the 10 years, the total increment she receives is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating the total pension after 30 years**:
   - Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be her base pension plus the total increment:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years of service will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]

To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the Pension Structure**:
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the Years of Service**:
   - Marcy works for 30 years, which means she has completed 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

3. **Calculating the Additional Pension**:
   - For each of the 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, she receives 5% of the pension value.
   - The pension value is $50,000.
   - The additional pension she earns for each of those 10 years is:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Since she earns this additional amount for 10 years, the total additional pension is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Annual Pension**:
   - The total annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years of service is the base pension plus the additional pension:
     \[
     \text{Total Annual Pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Pension Plan**: 
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year she continues to work.

2. **Calculating the Duration of Work**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years. 
   - She becomes entitled to the 5% increment after 20 years, so she will receive this increment for the additional 10 years (from year 20 to year 30).

3. **Calculating the 5% Increment**:
   - The value of the pension is $50,000.
   - The 5% of the pension is calculated as follows:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - This means that for each year after the 20th year, Marcy will receive an additional $2,500.

4. **Calculating Total Increment for 10 Years**:
   - Since Marcy is entitled to this increment for 10 years (from year 20 to year 30), we calculate the total increment:
     \[
     \text{Total Increment} = 2,500 \times 10 = 25,000
     \]

5. **Calculating the Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**:
   - Now, we add the total increment to the original pension amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Annual Pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
