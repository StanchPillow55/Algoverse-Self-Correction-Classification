Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cookies Katarina has:**
   - We are given that Katarina has 68 cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies Max has:**
   - The problem states that Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
     \[
     K = M - 5
     \]
     where \( K \) is the number of cookies Katarina has and \( M \) is the number of cookies Max has.
   - Since we know \( K = 68 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     68 = M - 5
     \]
   - To find \( M \), we add 5 to both sides:
     \[
     M = 68 + 5 = 73
     \]
   - So, Max has 73 cookies.

3. **Determine the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has:**
   - The problem states that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     M = C + 12
     \]
     where \( C \) is the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - We already found \( M = 73 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     73 = C + 12
     \]
   - To find \( C \), we subtract 12 from both sides:
     \[
     C = 73 - 12 = 61
     \]
   - So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

4. **Determine the number of cookies Summer has:**
   - The problem states that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     S = M + 23
     \]
     where \( S \) is the number of cookies Summer has.
   - We already found \( M = 73 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
     \[
     S = 73 + 23 = 96
     \]
   - So, Summer has 96 cookies.

5. **Calculate the total number of cookies:**
   - Now we have the number of cookies for each person:
     - Katarina: 68 cookies
     - Max: 73 cookies
     - Cookie Monster: 61 cookies
     - Summer: 96 cookies
   - To find the total number of cookies, we sum these amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total} = K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
     \]

   - Performing the addition step by step:
     \[
     68 + 73 = 141
     \]
     \[
     141 + 61 = 202
     \]
     \[
     202 + 96 = 298
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of cookies they have is \( \boxed{298} \).
