To find Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight he lost during the 3 months he was unwell and his final weight.

1. **Determine the total weight lost**: 
   Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. We can calculate the total weight lost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost} = \text{Weight lost per month} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost} = 10 \text{ pounds/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Identify Mark's final weight**: 
   According to the problem, Mark's final weight after losing weight is 70 pounds.

3. **Calculate Mark's initial weight**: 
   To find Mark's initial weight, we need to add the total weight lost to his final weight:
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Total weight lost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = 70 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 100 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Mark's initial weight was **100 pounds**.

Final answer: **100 pounds**.
