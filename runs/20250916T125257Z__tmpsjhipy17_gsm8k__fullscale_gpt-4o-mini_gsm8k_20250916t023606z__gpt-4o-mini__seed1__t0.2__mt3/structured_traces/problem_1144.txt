To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of men to women**: The ratio of men to women on the bus is given as 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Set up the ratio in terms of a variable**: Let the number of men be \(5x\) and the number of women be \(9x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

3. **Calculate the total number of passengers**: The total number of passengers on the bus is the sum of men and women:
   \[
   5x + 9x = 14x
   \]
   We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   14x = 84
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

5. **Find the number of men and women**:
   - Number of men:
   \[
   5x = 5 \times 6 = 30
   \]
   - Number of women:
   \[
   9x = 9 \times 6 = 54
   \]

6. **Determine how many women alight from the bus**: According to the problem, 20 women alight from the bus.

7. **Calculate the remaining number of women**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = \text{Initial number of women} - \text{Number of women alighting}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining women} = 54 - 20 = 34
   \]

8. **Final answer**: The number of women remaining on the bus after 20 women alight is \(34\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{34}
\]
