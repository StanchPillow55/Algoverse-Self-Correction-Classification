To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem statement. Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance:
   \[
   z = f
   \]

2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar:
   \[
   s = g
   \]

3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
   \[
   o = 2s
   \]

4. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest:
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now, we know that the total amount of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces:
\[
z + f + s + o + g = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the relationships we have into this equation. First, we can substitute \( f \) with \( z \) (from equation 1) and \( g \) with \( s \) (from equation 2). This gives us:
\[
z + z + s + o + s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 2s + o = 10
\]

Next, we can substitute \( o \) with \( 2s \) (from equation 3):
\[
2z + 2s + 2s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 4s = 10
\]

Now, we can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
z + 2s = 5
\]

Next, we can substitute \( s \) with \( 2z \) (from equation 4):
\[
z + 2(2z) = 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
z + 4z = 5
\]
\[
5z = 5
\]
Dividing both sides by 5 gives us:
\[
z = 1
\]

Now that we have \( z \), we can find \( s \):
\[
s = 2z = 2(1) = 2
\]

Next, we can find \( o \):
\[
o = 2s = 2(2) = 4
\]

Finally, we can summarize the amounts of each ingredient:
- \( z = 1 \) ounce (citrus zest)
- \( f = 1 \) ounce (fragrance)
- \( s = 2 \) ounces (salt)
- \( o = 4 \) ounces (oil)
- \( g = 2 \) ounces (sugar)

Now, we can check that the total adds up to 10 ounces:
\[
1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10
\]

Thus, the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different ingredients Tanya uses in her salt scrub. Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
- Let \( u \) be the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance:
   \[
   z = f
   \]

2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar:
   \[
   s = u
   \]

3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
   \[
   o = 2s
   \]

4. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest:
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now, we know that the total amount of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces:
\[
z + f + s + o + u = 10
\]

Substituting the relationships into the total equation:

- Since \( z = f \), we can replace \( f \) with \( z \):
  \[
  z + z + s + o + u = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2z + s + o + u = 10
  \]

- Since \( s = u \), we can replace \( u \) with \( s \):
  \[
  2z + s + o + s = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2z + 2s + o = 10
  \]

- Now, we substitute \( o = 2s \) into the equation:
  \[
  2z + 2s + 2s = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2z + 4s = 10
  \]

- Dividing the entire equation by 2 gives:
  \[
  z + 2s = 5
  \]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( s = 2z \)
2. \( z + 2s = 5 \)

Substituting \( s = 2z \) into the second equation:
\[
z + 2(2z) = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z + 4z = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5z = 5
\]
\[
z = 1
\]

Now, substituting \( z = 1 \) back to find \( s \):
\[
s = 2z = 2(1) = 2
\]

Now we can find \( o \):
\[
o = 2s = 2(2) = 4
\]

Thus, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[
\boxed{4} \text{ ounces}
\]
