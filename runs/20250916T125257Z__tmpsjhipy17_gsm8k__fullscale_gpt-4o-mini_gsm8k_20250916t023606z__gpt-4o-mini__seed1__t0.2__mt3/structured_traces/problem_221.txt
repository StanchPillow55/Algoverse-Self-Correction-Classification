To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank**: The tank starts with 120 liters of water.

2. **Water used by Celine**: Celine uses 90 liters of water from the tank. We need to subtract this amount from the initial amount of water.

   \[
   \text{Water left in the tank} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Water used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Water left in the tank} = 120 \, \text{liters} - 90 \, \text{liters} = 30 \, \text{liters}
   \]

3. **Rainwater collected**: Celine collects rainwater that is twice the amount of water left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, we calculate the rainwater collected as follows:

   \[
   \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times \text{Water left in the tank}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times 30 \, \text{liters} = 60 \, \text{liters}
   \]

4. **Total water in the tank now**: To find the total amount of water in the tank after collecting the rainwater, we add the rainwater collected to the water left in the tank.

   \[
   \text{Total water in the tank now} = \text{Water left in the tank} + \text{Rainwater collected}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water in the tank now} = 30 \, \text{liters} + 60 \, \text{liters} = 90 \, \text{liters}
   \]

Thus, the final amount of water in the tank now is:

\[
\boxed{90} \, \text{liters}
\]
