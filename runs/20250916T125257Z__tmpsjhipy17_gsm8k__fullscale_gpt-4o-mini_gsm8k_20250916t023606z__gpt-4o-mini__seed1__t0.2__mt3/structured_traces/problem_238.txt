To solve the problem, we will first determine the ages of each girl based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Jessa's age**: 
   We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's age**: 
   The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Since Jessa is 20 years old, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Mary's age**: 
   The problem also states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. We can calculate Mary's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages**: 
   Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa is:
   \[
   \boxed{68}
   \]
