To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each of their boxes, and then find the difference between the two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     4p = 64
     \]
   - To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars she has is 56.
   - Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Martha has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars can be expressed as:
     \[
     7m = 56
     \]
   - To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
     \[
     m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of chocolate bars in Peter's box and Martha's box:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

Thus, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

**Final Answer:**
Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.
