To find out how long John's trip took, we need to break it down into two parts: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

### Part 1: Trip to Friend's House

1. **Distance to Friend's House**: The original distance is 200 miles, but due to a detour, he drives an additional 10 miles. Therefore, the total distance to his friend's house is:
   \[
   200 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 210 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Speed**: John drives at a speed of 70 mph.

3. **Time Calculation**: To find the time taken to drive to his friend's house, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Part 2: Trip Back Home

1. **Distance Back Home**: The distance back home is given as 240 miles.

2. **Speed**: John drives back at a speed of 80 mph.

3. **Time Calculation**: Again, we use the same formula for time:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting in the values:
   \[
   \text{Time back home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Total Trip Time

Now, we can find the total time for the entire trip by adding the time taken to get to his friend's house and the time taken to return home:
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time back home}
\]
Substituting in the calculated times:
\[
\text{Total Trip Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time for John's trip is:
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ hours}}
\]
