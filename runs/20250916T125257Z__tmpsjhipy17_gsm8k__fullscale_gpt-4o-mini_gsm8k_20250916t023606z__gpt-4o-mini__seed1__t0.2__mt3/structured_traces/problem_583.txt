To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cups Judy bought:**
   Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is equal to 12.
   \[
   \text{Cups Judy bought} = 12
   \]

2. **Determine the number of dishes Judy bought:**
   Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Therefore, the number of dishes she bought can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Dishes Judy bought} = 2 \times \text{Cups Judy bought} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils Judy brought:**
   The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) that Judy brought is:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils Judy brought} = \text{Cups Judy bought} + \text{Dishes Judy bought} = 12 + 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Determine the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy's friend:**
   Judy's friend brought 40 cups. The problem states that the friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, we can calculate the number of dishes her friend brought:
   \[
   \text{Dishes friend brought} = \text{Dishes Judy bought} + 20 = 24 + 20 = 44
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by Judy's friend:**
   The total number of utensils (cups + dishes) that Judy's friend brought is:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils friend brought} = \text{Cups friend brought} + \text{Dishes friend brought} = 40 + 44 = 84
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend:**
   Now, we will add the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils brought by both} = \text{Total utensils Judy brought} + \text{Total utensils friend brought} = 36 + 84 = 120
   \]

Finally, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
