To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with the tree over time.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons.

Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue (R) from selling the lemons can be calculated as follows:

\[
R = \text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Price per lemon}
\]
\[
R = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the annual costs.

The annual costs (C) consist of the cost to water and feed the tree, which is $3 per year. 

### Step 3: Calculate the net annual profit.

The net annual profit (P) can be calculated by subtracting the annual costs from the annual revenue:

\[
P = R - C
\]
\[
P = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the initial investment.

Carlos has an initial investment of $90 to plant the tree.

### Step 5: Determine how many years it will take to recover the initial investment.

To find out how many years (Y) it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment through his annual profit, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Total profit after Y years} = \text{Initial investment}
\]
\[
P \times Y = 90
\]
Substituting the value of P:

\[
7.5 \times Y = 90
\]

### Step 6: Solve for Y.

To find Y, we divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:

\[
Y = \frac{90}{7.5}
\]
\[
Y = 12
\]

### Conclusion

It will take Carlos **12 years** to start earning money on the lemon tree after recovering his initial investment of $90. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost
The initial cost to plant the lemon tree is given as:
- **Cost to plant the tree**: $90

### Step 2: Calculate annual revenue from lemons
Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.50. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Number of Lemons} \times \text{Price per Lemon}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate annual costs
Each year, Carlos incurs a cost of $3 to water and feed the tree. Therefore, the total annual cost is:
\[
\text{Annual Cost} = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate annual profit
To find the annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = 10.50 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of years to break even
To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to cover his initial investment of $90, we need to divide the initial cost by the annual profit:
\[
\text{Number of Years to Break Even} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Annual Profit}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of Years to Break Even} = \frac{90 \text{ dollars}}{7.50 \text{ dollars/year}} = 12 \text{ years}
\]

### Conclusion
Carlos will start earning money from the lemon tree after 12 years. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Initial Costs
- **Cost to plant the tree**: $90

### Step 2: Annual Revenue from Lemons
- **Lemons produced per year**: 7 lemons
- **Selling price per lemon**: $1.5
- **Annual revenue from lemons**: 
  \[
  \text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Lemons produced} \times \text{Selling price per lemon} = 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 3: Annual Costs
- **Annual cost to water and feed the tree**: $3

### Step 4: Annual Profit Calculation
To find the annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Break-even Analysis
Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment of $90 through his annual profit of $7.5.

To find the number of years required to break even, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Total Profit} = \text{Annual Profit} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]
We want to find the number of years (let's denote it as \( y \)) such that:
\[
7.5y = 90
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( y \)
To find \( y \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:
\[
y = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

### Conclusion
It will take Carlos **12 years** to start earning money from the lemon tree after covering the initial planting cost and the ongoing annual expenses.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
