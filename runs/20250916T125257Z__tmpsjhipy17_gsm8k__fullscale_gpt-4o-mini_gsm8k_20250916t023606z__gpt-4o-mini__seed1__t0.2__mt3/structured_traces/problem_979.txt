turn 1
To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the information given about their ages when Emil turns 24.

1. **Determine Emil's age when he turns 24**:
   Emil is currently 19 years old. Therefore, he will turn 24 in:
   \[
   24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate Emil's dad's age when Emil turns 24**:
   Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad. In 5 years, Emil's dad will be:
   \[
   D + 5
   \]
   According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
   \[
   24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
   \]

   To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   48 = D + 5
   \]
   Now, we can solve for \( D \):
   \[
   D = 48 - 5 = 43
   \]
   So, Emil's dad is currently 43 years old.

3. **Calculate Emil's brother's age when Emil turns 24**:
   Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother. In 5 years, Emil's brother will be:
   \[
   B + 5
   \]
   According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother:
   \[
   24 = 2(B + 5)
   \]

   Again, we can eliminate the fraction by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   12 = B + 5
   \]
   Now, we can solve for \( B \):
   \[
   B = 12 - 5 = 7
   \]
   So, Emil's brother is currently 7 years old.

4. **Calculate the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now**:
   Now that we have the current ages:
   - Emil's dad: 43 years old
   - Emil's brother: 7 years old

   The sum of their ages is:
   \[
   43 + 7 = 50
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:
   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
