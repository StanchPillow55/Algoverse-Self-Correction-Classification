To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of management employees.**
2. **Calculate how many of those management employees oversee the entire company.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of management employees

The problem states that 20% of the employees are management. We know the total number of employees is 50.

To find the number of management employees, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[
\text{Number of management employees} = 20\% \times 50
\]

Converting 20% to a decimal:

\[
20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Number of management employees} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
\]

So, there are 10 management employees.

### Step 2: Calculate how many of those management employees oversee the entire company

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. The problem states that out of the management employees, only 30% oversee the entire company.

To find this, we calculate 30% of the 10 management employees:

\[
\text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 30\% \times 10
\]

Again, converting 30% to a decimal:

\[
30\% = \frac{30}{100} = 0.30
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 0.30 \times 10 = 3
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of employees who oversee the entire company is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
