To determine how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the monthly share for each roommate**:
   - The total electricity bill is $100 per month.
   - There are 5 people in total (Jenna and her 4 roommates).
   - To find the share for each person, we divide the total bill by the number of people:
     \[
     \text{Monthly share per person} = \frac{\text{Total bill}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, each roommate (including Jenna) pays $20 per month.

2. **Calculate the yearly share for each roommate**:
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly cost:
     \[
     \text{Yearly share per person} = \text{Monthly share per person} \times 12 = 20 \times 12 = 240
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.

Thus, the final answer is that each roommate pays **$240 per year** for electricity.
