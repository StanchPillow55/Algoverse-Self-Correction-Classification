To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of acres on both Farmer Brown's and Farmer Smith's farms.

1. **Identify the size of Farmer Brown's farm**:
   - Farmer Brown's farm is given as 200 acres.

2. **Determine the size of Farmer Smith's farm**:
   - The problem states that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.
   - First, we need to calculate twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm:
     \[
     2 \times 200 \text{ acres} = 400 \text{ acres}
     \]
   - Now, we add 100 acres to this amount to find the size of Farmer Smith's farm:
     \[
     400 \text{ acres} + 100 \text{ acres} = 500 \text{ acres}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of acres on both farms**:
   - Now that we have the sizes of both farms, we can add them together:
     \[
     200 \text{ acres (Farmer Brown)} + 500 \text{ acres (Farmer Smith)} = 700 \text{ acres}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of acres on both farms together is:
     \[
     \boxed{700} \text{ acres}
     \]
