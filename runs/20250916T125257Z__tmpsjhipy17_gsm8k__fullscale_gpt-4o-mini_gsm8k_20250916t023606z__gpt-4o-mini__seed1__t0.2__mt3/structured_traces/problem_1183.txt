Let's break down the problem step by step and keep track of the number of apples Newton has at each stage.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picks up these two apples.
   - At this point, Newton has **2 apples**.

2. **Putting One in His Pocket**:
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket.
   - Now, he has **1 apple in his hand** (the one he didn't put in his pocket) and **1 apple in his pocket**.
   - Total apples with Newton = **2 apples** (1 in hand + 1 in pocket).

3. **Throwing One Apple at the Tree**:
   - Newton throws the apple he has in his hand at the tree.
   - This action causes **5 more apples to fall out of the tree**.
   - Now, he has **5 new apples** that fell from the tree, plus the **1 apple in his pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **5 + 1 = 6 apples**.

4. **Putting All but One in His Pocket**:
   - Newton puts all but one of the 5 new apples in his pocket.
   - This means he keeps **1 apple** in his hand and puts **4 apples** in his pocket.
   - Now, he has **1 apple in hand** and **4 apples in pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **1 + 4 = 5 apples**.

5. **Throwing the Remaining Apple at the Tree**:
   - Newton throws the remaining apple he has in his hand at the tree.
   - This causes **6 more apples to fall out of the tree**.
   - Now, he has **6 new apples** that fell from the tree, plus the **4 apples in his pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **6 + 4 = 10 apples**.

6. **Final Count of Apples**:
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 new apples that fell out of the tree).
   - He already has **4 apples in his pocket**.
   - Total apples he brings home = **10 apples**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Newton brought home 10 apples.**

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell from the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples.

   At this point, Newton has:
   \[
   2 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. **First Action**:
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket and throws the other apple into the tree.
   
   After this action, Newton has:
   \[
   1 \text{ apple in his pocket}
   \]

3. **Apples Falling from the Tree**:
   - Throwing the apple into the tree causes 5 more apples to fall out.
   
   Now, the total number of apples that have fallen (including the initial two) is:
   \[
   2 + 5 = 7 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Picking Up the Fallen Apples**:
   - Newton picks up these 5 new apples.
   
   Now, he has:
   \[
   1 \text{ (in pocket)} + 5 \text{ (picked up)} = 6 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. **Second Action**:
   - Newton puts all but one of the 5 new apples in his pocket and throws the remaining one at the tree.
   
   This means he puts 4 apples in his pocket and throws 1 apple. After this, he has:
   \[
   1 \text{ (in pocket)} + 4 \text{ (added to pocket)} = 5 \text{ apples in pocket}
   \]

6. **More Apples Falling from the Tree**:
   - Throwing the apple at the tree causes another 6 apples to fall out.
   
   Now, the total number of apples that have fallen (including the previous 7) is:
   \[
   7 + 6 = 13 \text{ apples}
   \]

7. **Picking Up the New Fallen Apples**:
   - Newton picks up these 6 new apples.
   
   Now, he has:
   \[
   5 \text{ (in pocket)} + 6 \text{ (picked up)} = 11 \text{ apples}
   \]

8. **Final Count**:
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 he just picked up) and goes home to make a pie.

Thus, the total number of apples Newton brings home is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
