To find the combined weights of Grace and Alex, we will first determine Alex's weight based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Grace's weight**: 
   - Grace weighs 125 pounds.

2. **Calculate Alex's weight**: 
   - According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 
   - First, we need to calculate 4 times Grace's weight:
     \[
     4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract 2 pounds from this amount to find Alex's weight:
     \[
     500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate their combined weight**:
   - Now that we have both weights, we can find their combined weight by adding Grace's weight and Alex's weight together:
     \[
     125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The combined weight of Grace and Alex is \( \boxed{623} \) pounds.
