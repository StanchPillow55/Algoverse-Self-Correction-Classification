To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given about the herd of camels and dromedaries.

Let's define:
- \( c \): the number of camels
- \( d \): the number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads (180) gives us our first equation:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps (304) gives us our second equation:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)  (Equation 2)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( d \) into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify this equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( d \) using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries \( d \) is 56.

Finally, let's summarize our findings:
- Number of camels \( c = 124 \)
- Number of dromedaries \( d = 56 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The number of dromedaries is } 56.
\]
