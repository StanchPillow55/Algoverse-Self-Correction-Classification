To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate John's total earnings for the week:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings per hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours worked} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings per hour} \times \text{Hours worked} = 50 \times 6 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine John's expenses:**
   - He spends 50 dollars on gas.
   - He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.

   We will calculate his total expenses:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Gas} + \text{Deposit} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate John's remaining money after expenses:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Total expenses} = 300 - 150 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - John buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the pencils:**
   \[
   \text{Money left after pencils} = \text{Remaining money} - \text{Cost of pencils} = 150 - 50 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many 25 dollar pens John can buy with the remaining money:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of one pen} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{\text{Money left after pencils}}{\text{Cost of one pen}} = \frac{100}{25} = 4
   \]

Thus, after buying 5 pencils, John can buy **4 pens**.

**Final Answer: 4**
