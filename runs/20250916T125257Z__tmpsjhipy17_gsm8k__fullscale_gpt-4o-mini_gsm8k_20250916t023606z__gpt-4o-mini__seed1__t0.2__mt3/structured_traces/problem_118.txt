To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of vehicles from the first day.**
   - We know that there are 2 containers, and each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles from first day} = \text{Number of containers} \times \text{Vehicles per container} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day.**
   - According to the problem, the total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is 30 vehicles.

3. **Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day.**
   - To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles added on second day} = \text{Total vehicles} - \text{Vehicles from first day} = 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of containers imported on the second day.**
   - Since we know that each container contains 5 vehicles, we can find the number of containers that were imported on the second day by dividing the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
     \[
     \text{Number of containers on second day} = \frac{\text{Vehicles added on second day}}{\text{Vehicles per container}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers}
     \]

5. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]
