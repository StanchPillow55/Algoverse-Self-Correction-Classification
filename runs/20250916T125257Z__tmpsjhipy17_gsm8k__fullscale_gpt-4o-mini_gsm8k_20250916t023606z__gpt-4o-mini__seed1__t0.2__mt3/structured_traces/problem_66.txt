To determine the total number of people sent by the four schools to the basketball tournament, we need to account for the players and coaches from both the girls' and boys' teams for each school.

1. **Identify the number of teams per school**:
   - Each school has a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
   - Therefore, each school has a total of:
     \[
     2 \text{ teams (1 girls' + 1 boys')}
     \]

2. **Identify the number of players per team**:
   - Each team consists of 5 players.
   - Thus, for each school, the total number of players is:
     \[
     5 \text{ players/team} \times 2 \text{ teams} = 10 \text{ players}
     \]

3. **Identify the number of coaches per school**:
   - Each team has 1 coach, so for 2 teams, each school has:
     \[
     2 \text{ coaches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people per school**:
   - The total number of people (players + coaches) from each school is:
     \[
     10 \text{ players} + 2 \text{ coaches} = 12 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of people from all schools**:
   - Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all schools is:
     \[
     12 \text{ people/school} \times 4 \text{ schools} = 48 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the total number of people sent by all of the schools to the basketball tournament is:

\[
\boxed{48}
\]
