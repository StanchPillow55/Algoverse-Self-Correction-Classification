To solve the problem, we need to determine how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set.

1. **Identify the total amount spent and the cost of the CD:**
   - Total amount spent: $48
   - Cost of one CD: $4

2. **Let \( x \) be the cost of the headphone set.**
   - The total amount spent can be expressed as:
     \[
     4 + x = 48
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     x = 48 - 4 = 44
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $44.

4. **Calculate how much money Tom would have had if he did not buy the headphone set:**
   - If Tom did not buy the headphone set, he would have the full $48 to spend on CDs.

5. **Determine how many CDs Tom could buy with $48:**
   - The number of CDs he could buy is calculated by dividing the total amount by the cost of one CD:
     \[
     \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
     \]

6. **Determine how many CDs Tom actually bought:**
   - Tom bought 1 CD for $4. 

7. **Calculate how many more CDs he could have bought:**
   - The difference between the number of CDs he could have bought without the headphone set and the number of CDs he actually bought is:
     \[
     \text{More CDs} = 12 - 1 = 11
     \]

Thus, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy **11 more CDs**.

**Final Answer: 11**
