To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.**
   Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, the total number of servings she will consume in 60 days is:
   \[
   \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs.**
   Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream. To find out how many cartons Cynthia needs, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
   \[
   \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}} = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.**
   Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton} = 4 \times 4.00 = 16.00
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   After 60 days, Cynthia will spend a total of:
   \[
   \boxed{16.00}
   \] 

Thus, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.
