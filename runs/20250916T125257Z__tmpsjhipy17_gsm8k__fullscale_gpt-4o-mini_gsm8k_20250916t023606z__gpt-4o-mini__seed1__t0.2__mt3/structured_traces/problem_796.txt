To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary paid to all employees during that time.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of new employees hired over three months.

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Therefore, over three months, the total number of new employees hired is:

\[
\text{New employees hired} = 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees becomes:

\[
\text{Total employees after 3 months} = \text{Initial employees} + \text{New employees hired}
\]
\[
\text{Total employees after 3 months} = 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees for three months.

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees in one month is:

\[
\text{Total salary for one month} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for one month} = 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary paid over three months.

To find the total salary paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

\[
\text{Total salary for three months} = \text{Total salary for one month} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for three months} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \times 3 = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

\[
\boxed{3,120,000 \text{ dollars}}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, taking into account the initial number of employees and the number of new hires each month.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of employees and their salaries
- The company starts with **200 employees**.
- Each employee is paid **$4000** per month.

### Step 2: Calculate the total salary for the initial employees for one month
The total salary for the initial employees in one month can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total salary for initial employees} = \text{Number of initial employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for initial employees} = 200 \times 4000 = 800,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of new employees hired each month
The company hires **20 new employees** every month.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of employees at the end of each month
1. **End of Month 1**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Initial employees + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 1} = 200 + 20 = 220
   \]

2. **End of Month 2**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 1 + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 2} = 220 + 20 = 240
   \]

3. **End of Month 3**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 2 + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 3} = 240 + 20 = 260
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total salary for each month
1. **Total salary for Month 1**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 1} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 1} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 1} = 220 \times 4000 = 880,000
   \]

2. **Total salary for Month 2**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 2} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 2} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 2} = 240 \times 4000 = 960,000
   \]

3. **Total salary for Month 3**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 3} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 3} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 3} = 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
   \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total salary paid over the three months
Now, we sum the total salaries for each of the three months:
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = \text{Total salary for Month 1} + \text{Total salary for Month 2} + \text{Total salary for Month 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = 880,000 + 960,000 + 1,040,000
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = 2,880,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$2,880,000**.

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Employee Count**: The company starts with 200 employees.

2. **Monthly Hiring Rate**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.

3. **Salary per Employee**: Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month.

4. **Time Frame**: We need to calculate the total salary paid after three months.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Employees After Three Months

- **Month 1**: 
  - Initial employees: 200
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 1: 
    \[
    200 + 20 = 220
    \]

- **Month 2**: 
  - Employees from Month 1: 220
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 2: 
    \[
    220 + 20 = 240
    \]

- **Month 3**: 
  - Employees from Month 2: 240
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 3: 
    \[
    240 + 20 = 260
    \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Salary Paid Each Month

- **Month 1**: 
  - Total employees: 220
  - Total salary for Month 1:
    \[
    220 \times 4000 = 880,000
    \]

- **Month 2**: 
  - Total employees: 240
  - Total salary for Month 2:
    \[
    240 \times 4000 = 960,000
    \]

- **Month 3**: 
  - Total employees: 260
  - Total salary for Month 3:
    \[
    260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
    \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Salary Paid Over Three Months

Now, we will sum the total salaries paid over the three months:

\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = \text{Month 1 salary} + \text{Month 2 salary} + \text{Month 3 salary}
\]
\[
= 880,000 + 960,000 + 1,040,000
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Add Month 1 and Month 2:
   \[
   880,000 + 960,000 = 1,840,000
   \]

2. Now add Month 3:
   \[
   1,840,000 + 1,040,000 = 2,880,000
   \]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[
\boxed{2,880,000}
\]
