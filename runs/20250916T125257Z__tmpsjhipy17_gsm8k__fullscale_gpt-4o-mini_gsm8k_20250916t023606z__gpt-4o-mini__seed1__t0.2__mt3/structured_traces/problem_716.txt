To find the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories contributed by the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs
John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese
John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Number of ounces of cheese} \times \text{Calories per ounce of cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham
John also uses 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Number of ounces of ham} \times \text{Calories per ounce of ham}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum all the calories
Now we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to find the total calories in the omelet.

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.

To find the total number of calories in John's 6 egg omelet with cheese and ham, we will calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs
John uses 6 eggs, and each egg contains 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese
John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce of cheese contains 120 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Number of ounces of cheese} \times \text{Calories per ounce of cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham
John uses an equal amount of ham, which is also 2 ounces. Each ounce of ham contains 40 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Number of ounces of ham} \times \text{Calories per ounce of ham}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum the calories from all ingredients
Now, we will add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham to find the total calories in the omelet.

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of calories in John's 6 egg omelet with cheese and ham is **770 calories**.

To find the total calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate calories from the eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
   \[
   \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate calories from the cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = Amount of cheese (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate calories from the ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham (equal amount to cheese).
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = Amount of ham (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Sum all the calories:**
   - Total calories in the omelet = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.
