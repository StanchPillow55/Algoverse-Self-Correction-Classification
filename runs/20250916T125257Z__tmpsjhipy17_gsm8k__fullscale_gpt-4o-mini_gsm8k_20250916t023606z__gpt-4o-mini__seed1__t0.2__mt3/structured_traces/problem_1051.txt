To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.**
   - Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of cups she drinks can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total cups} = \text{Cups per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total cups} = 8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ cups}
     \]

2. **Convert cups to gallons.**
   - We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon. To find out how many gallons are in 240 cups, we can use the conversion factor:
     \[
     \text{Total gallons} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per gallon}} = \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \text{Total gallons} = \frac{240}{16} = 15 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{15} \text{ gallons}
     \]
