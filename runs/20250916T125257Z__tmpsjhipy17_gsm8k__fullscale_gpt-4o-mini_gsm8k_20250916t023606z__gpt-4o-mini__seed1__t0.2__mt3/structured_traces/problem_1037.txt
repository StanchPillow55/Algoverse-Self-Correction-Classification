To determine how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of Parmesan cheese.**
   - The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
   - Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of Mozzarella cheese.**
   - The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
   - Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for Parmesan + Total cost for Mozzarella
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Amor has left after buying the cheese.**
   - Amor starts with $50.
   - Amount left = Starting amount - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheese, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

Final answer: **10 dollars**.

To determine how much money Amor has left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchases and then subtract that from her initial amount of cash.

1. **Calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Parmesan cheese = $11
   - Amount of Parmesan cheese bought = 2 pounds
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Mozzarella cheese = $6
   - Amount of Mozzarella cheese bought = 3 pounds
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for Parmesan} + \text{Total cost for Mozzarella}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Amor has left:**
   - Initial amount of cash = $50
   - Amount spent on cheese = $40
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheese, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

**Final Answer: $10**

4. **Determine how much money Amor has left:**
   - Amor starts with $50.
   - We subtract the total cost of the cheeses from her initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheeses, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.
