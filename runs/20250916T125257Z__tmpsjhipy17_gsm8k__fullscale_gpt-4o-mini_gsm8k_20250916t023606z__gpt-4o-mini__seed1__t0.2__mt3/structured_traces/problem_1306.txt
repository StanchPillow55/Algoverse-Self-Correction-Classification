To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Items Requested by Dr. Grumpus:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Items Gathered by Igor:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half of what was requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested, so:
     \[
     \text{Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
     \]
   - Beakers: Igor gathered the correct number, which is 7.

3. **Total Items Gathered by Igor:**
   Now we can calculate the total number of items Igor gathered before losing any beakers:
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total items gathered} = 8 + 7 + 16 = 31
   \]

4. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   We know from the problem that the total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench was 29. This means that some beakers were lost. Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor lost.

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   Since Igor started with 7 beakers and lost \( x \) of them, the number of beakers he actually placed on the lab bench is:
   \[
   7 - x
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of items on the lab bench can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total on lab bench} = \text{Test tubes} + (\text{Beakers} - x) + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   29 = 8 + (7 - x) + 16
   \]

6. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   Now we simplify the equation:
   \[
   29 = 8 + 7 - x + 16
   \]
   \[
   29 = 31 - x
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 31 - 29
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Thus, Igor lost **2 beakers**.

**Final Answer:**
Igor lost 2 beakers.
