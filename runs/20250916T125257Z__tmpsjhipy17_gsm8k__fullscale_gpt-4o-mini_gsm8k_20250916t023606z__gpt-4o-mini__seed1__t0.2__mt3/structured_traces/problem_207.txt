To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, and then add those two weights together.

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the chocolate bars

We know that:
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar:

\[
\text{Weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight of each chocolate bar}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of chocolate bars} = 1000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weight of the candied apples

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that:
- There are 80 candied apples.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, we can find the weight of each candied apple.

Let \( x \) be the weight of each candied apple. According to the problem:
\[
40 \, \text{g} = 2x
\]
To find \( x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{40 \, \text{g}}{2} = 20 \, \text{g}
\]

Now that we know each candied apple weighs 20 grams, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[
\text{Weight of candied apples} = \text{Number of candied apples} \times \text{Weight of each candied apple}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of candied apples} = 1600 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the bag of candy

Now we can find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of chocolate bars} + \text{Weight of candied apples}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1000 \, \text{g} + 1600 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 2600 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is \( \boxed{2600} \) grams.
