To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance the bird travels in the southerly direction and subtract the distance traveled back north.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled south for the first leg of the journey.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled north for the second leg of the journey.

The bird then flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 18 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 36 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled south for the third leg of the journey.

Finally, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

\[
\text{Distance}_3 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 22 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 110 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled south.

Now, we will add the distances traveled south and subtract the distance traveled north.

\[
\text{Total Distance South} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_3 = 300 \, \text{miles} + 110 \, \text{miles} = 410 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the net distance from the northern home to the southern home.

Now, we subtract the distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

\[
\text{Net Distance} = \text{Total Distance South} - \text{Distance}_2 = 410 \, \text{miles} - 36 \, \text{miles} = 374 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is:

\[
\boxed{374} \, \text{miles}
\]
