To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank.**
2. **Calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days.**
3. **Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water.**

### Step 1: Determine the amount of water in the tank

The problem states that there are 10,000 gallons of water in the pool. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, we calculate the amount of water in the tank as follows:

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Amount of water in the pool}
\]
\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10000 = 5000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. To find out how much water is used in 6 days, we multiply the daily usage by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = \text{Daily usage} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining water in the tank

Now, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank:

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = \text{Initial amount in the tank} - \text{Total water used}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5000 \text{ gallons} - 3000 \text{ gallons} = 2000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

After 6 days, the amount of water remaining in the tank is:

\[
\boxed{2000} \text{ gallons}
\]
