To solve the problem, we will follow the changes in temperature step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The problem states that the initial temperature is 2 degrees Celsius.

   \[
   \text{Initial Temperature} = 2^\circ C
   \]

2. **Temperature Drop**: The temperature then drops by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. We need to subtract this drop from the initial temperature.

   \[
   \text{Temperature after drop} = \text{Initial Temperature} - \text{Drop}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature after drop} = 2^\circ C - 8^\circ C
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature after drop} = -6^\circ C
   \]

3. **Temperature Increase**: In the morning, the temperature increases by 3 degrees Celsius. We will add this increase to the temperature after the drop.

   \[
   \text{Temperature in the morning} = \text{Temperature after drop} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature in the morning} = -6^\circ C + 3^\circ C
   \]
   \[
   \text{Temperature in the morning} = -3^\circ C
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: After performing the calculations, we find that the temperature in the morning is:

   \[
   \boxed{-3^\circ C}
   \]
