To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then find out how many additional bottles Hortex needs to produce beyond its current daily production of 4200 bottles.

### Step 1: Determine the daily energy needs covered by one bottle of juice

Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we would need:

\[
\text{Number of bottles needed for 1 person} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles needed for 2300 people

Now, we need to find out how many bottles are required for 2300 people:

\[
\text{Total bottles needed} = \text{Number of bottles per person} \times \text{Number of people}
\]
\[
\text{Total bottles needed} = 5 \text{ bottles/person} \times 2300 \text{ people} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles, we subtract the current production from the total required:

\[
\text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Current production}
\]
\[
\text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Final Answer

Hortex would need to produce **7300 more bottles** of carrot juice to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

To determine how many more bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people**:
   Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we would need 5 bottles (since \(100\% \div 20\% = 5\)).

   For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces**:
   Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Calculate the additional bottles needed**:
   To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Current production}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Thus, Hortex would need to produce **7300 more bottles** of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

**Final Answer**: 7300 bottles.
