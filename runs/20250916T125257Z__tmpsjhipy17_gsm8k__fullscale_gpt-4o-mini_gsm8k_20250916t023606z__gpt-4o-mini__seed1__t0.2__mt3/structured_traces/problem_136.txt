To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands**:
   We know that there are a total of 27 unicorns in the world. According to the problem, one third of these unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.

   To find one third of 27, we perform the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]

2. **Determine the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands**:
   Next, we are told that two thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands are female. We have already calculated that there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

   To find two thirds of 9, we perform the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of female Scottish unicorns is:
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]
