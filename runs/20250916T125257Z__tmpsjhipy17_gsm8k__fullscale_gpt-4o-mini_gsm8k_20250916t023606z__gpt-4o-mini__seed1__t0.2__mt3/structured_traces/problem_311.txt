To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the family consumes in a week based on the daily consumption of eggs by each family member.

1. **Identify the family members and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 members in the family.
   - Three of them eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining two members eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:**
   - For the three members who eat 3 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by three members} = 3 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ eggs/member} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - For the two members who eat 2 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by two members} = 2 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ eggs/member} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the family:**
   - Add the eggs consumed by both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = 9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we multiply the daily consumption by the number of days in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Total weekly consumption} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The family will consume a total of **91 eggs** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{91}
\]
