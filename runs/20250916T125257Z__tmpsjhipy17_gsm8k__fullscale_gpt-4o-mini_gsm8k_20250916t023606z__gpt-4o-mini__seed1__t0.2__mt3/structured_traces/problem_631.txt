To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the price of the diamond jewel**:
   We are given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

   \[
   \text{Price of diamond jewel} = 2000
   \]

2. **Calculate the price of the gold jewel**:
   The problem states that the price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Calculate the price of the silver jewel**:
   The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. We can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = \text{Price of gold jewel} - 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Calculate the total price for all three jewels**:
   Now that we have the prices for all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together:

   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 4800
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total price for all three jewels is:

   \[
   \boxed{4800}
   \]
