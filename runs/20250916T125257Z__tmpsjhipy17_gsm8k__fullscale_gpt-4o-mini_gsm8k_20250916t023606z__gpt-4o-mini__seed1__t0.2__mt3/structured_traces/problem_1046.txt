To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked over the given time period. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days worked**:
   The team of painters worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. To convert this into hours, we need to know how many hours are in a full day. Assuming a full day is 8 hours, we can calculate the hours worked each day:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:
   \[
   \text{Total hours worked by the team} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter**:
   There are 4 painters working together. To find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{63 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 15.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, each painter worked for a total of 15.75 hours.

**Final Answer**: Each painter put in 15.75 hours of work.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked in total over the 3-week period.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days worked

The problem states that the painters worked for 3 weeks. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so we can calculate the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by the team

The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. To find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days, we first need to convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate:

\[
\text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:

\[
\text{Total hours worked by the team} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the hours worked by each painter

Since there are 4 painters working together, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[
\text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Each painter worked for a total of **47.25 hours**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked in total over the 3 weeks, and then divide that by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked
The problem states that the team worked for 3 weeks. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so we can calculate the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total fraction of a day worked
The team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. To find the total fraction of a day worked over the 21 days, we multiply the fraction of a day worked each day by the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total fraction of a day} = 21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Convert the total fraction of a day to hours
Next, we need to convert the total fraction of days worked into hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so we multiply the total fraction of days by 24 hours:

\[
\text{Total hours worked} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total hours worked} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8}
\]

Calculating \( 63 \times 24 \):

\[
63 \times 24 = 1512
\]

Now, dividing by 8:

\[
\frac{1512}{8} = 189 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the hours worked by each painter
Since there are 4 painters, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[
\text{Hours per painter} = \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Each painter worked a total of **47.25 hours**.
