To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars available.**
2. **Determine how many chocolate bars are distributed to the adults.**
3. **Calculate how many chocolate bars remain for the children.**
4. **Distribute the remaining chocolate bars equally among the children.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars

Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is:

\[
\text{Total chocolate bars} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Chocolate bars per packet} = 8 \times 5 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many chocolate bars are distributed to the adults

There are 4 adults, and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars. Thus, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:

\[
\text{Total for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Chocolate bars per adult} = 4 \times 6 = 24
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many chocolate bars remain for the children

Now, we subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:

\[
\text{Remaining chocolate bars} = \text{Total chocolate bars} - \text{Total for adults} = 40 - 24 = 16
\]

### Step 4: Distribute the remaining chocolate bars equally among the children

There are 8 children, and we need to share the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them. The number of chocolate bars each child gets is:

\[
\text{Chocolate bars per child} = \frac{\text{Remaining chocolate bars}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{16}{8} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

Each child will get **2 chocolate bars**.
