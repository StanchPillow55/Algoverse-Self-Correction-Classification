To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.**
2. **Determine how many packs Anne kept and how many she gave away.**
3. **Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets given to her friends.**
4. **Divide the total number of pieces given to her friends by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.

Anne purchased a box that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. 

To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack:

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 15 \times 60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
15 \times 60 = 900
\]

So, the total number of pieces of sweets in the box is **900 pieces**.

### Step 2: Determine how many packs Anne kept and how many she gave away.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. Therefore, the number of packs she gave away is:

\[
\text{Packs given away} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2 = 13
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets given to her friends.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of sweets are in the 13 packs that Anne gave away. We calculate this by multiplying the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack:

\[
\text{Total pieces given away} = \text{Packs given away} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 13 \times 60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
13 \times 60 = 780
\]

So, Anne gave away a total of **780 pieces** of sweets.

### Step 4: Divide the total number of pieces given to her friends by the number of friends.

Anne gave the 780 pieces equally among her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Total pieces given away}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{780}{10}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{780}{10} = 78
\]

Thus, each friend received **78 pieces** of sweets.

### Final Answer

Each of Anne's friends received **78 pieces** of sweets.
