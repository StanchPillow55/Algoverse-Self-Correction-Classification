To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his drinking habits into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Identify John's daily water consumption on weekdays:**
   - John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus one before bed.
   - This totals to:
     - Breakfast: 1 glass
     - Lunch: 1 glass
     - Dinner: 1 glass
     - Before bed: 1 glass
   - Therefore, the total glasses of water John drinks in one day on a weekday is:
     \[
     1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ glasses of water}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's water consumption for weekdays:**
   - John follows this routine every weekday (Monday to Friday), which is 5 days.
   - The total glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays is:
     \[
     4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses of water}
     \]

3. **Identify John's drinking habits on weekends:**
   - On Saturday and Sunday, John has a soda with dinner instead of water. Therefore, he does not drink any water during dinner on these days.
   - However, he still drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.
   - This totals to:
     - Breakfast: 1 glass
     - Lunch: 1 glass
     - Before bed: 1 glass
   - Therefore, the total glasses of water John drinks in one day on the weekend is:
     \[
     1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \text{ glasses of water}
     \]

4. **Calculate John's water consumption for weekends:**
   - John follows this routine on both Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days.
   - The total glasses of water John drinks during the weekends is:
     \[
     3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses of water}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total water consumption for the entire week:**
   - Now, we add the total glasses of water consumed during the weekdays and the weekends:
     \[
     20 \text{ glasses (weekdays)} + 6 \text{ glasses (weekends)} = 26 \text{ glasses of water}
     \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
