To find the average score across John's 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Sum the scores of all tests**: We first need to add up the scores from all four tests.

   - John's scores are:
     - Test 1: 100
     - Test 2: 100
     - Test 3: 100
     - Test 4: 80

   We can calculate the total score as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Score} = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   100 + 100 = 200
   \]
   \[
   200 + 100 = 300
   \]
   \[
   300 + 80 = 380
   \]

   So, the total score across all tests is:
   \[
   \text{Total Score} = 380
   \]

2. **Count the number of tests**: John took a total of 4 tests.

3. **Calculate the average score**: The average score is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of tests.

   The formula for the average is:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{380}{4}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   380 \div 4 = 95
   \]

Thus, John's average score across the 4 tests is:
\[
\boxed{95}
\]
