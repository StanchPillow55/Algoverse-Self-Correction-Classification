To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily feed requirement for the chickens**:
   Each chicken requires 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we can calculate the total daily feed requirement as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total daily feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily feed} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon**:
   Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. We can find the total feed given in these two meals:

   \[
   \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = \text{Morning feed} + \text{Afternoon feed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount of feed needed for the final meal**:
   To find out how much feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:

   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total daily feed} - \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.

Final Answer: **20 cups**
