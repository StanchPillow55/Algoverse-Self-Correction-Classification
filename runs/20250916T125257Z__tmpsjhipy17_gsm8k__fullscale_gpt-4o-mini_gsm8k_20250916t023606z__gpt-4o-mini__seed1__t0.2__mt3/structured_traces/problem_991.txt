To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   - Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Determine the Age of Bill's Dad When He Saw the Comet**:
   - Bill's dad saw the comet at age 30.

3. **Calculate the Age of Bill's Dad When Bill Saw the Comet a Second Time**:
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, the next time Bill's dad would see the comet after his first sighting would be:
     \[
     30 + 75 = 105 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet a Second Time**:
   - We know that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw it.
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet. Therefore, three times that age is:
     \[
     3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - This means Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old.

5. **Calculate the Time Between the First and Second Sightings of the Comet**:
   - The time between the first and second sightings of the comet is 75 years (the period of the comet's orbit).

6. **Determine Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time**:
   - Let \( x \) be Bill's age when he first saw the comet.
   - Since Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 90 years old, and this was 75 years after the first sighting, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 75 = 90
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 90 - 75 = 15
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
