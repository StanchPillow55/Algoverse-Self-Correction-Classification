To solve the problem, we will break it down day by day and then calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach over the week.

1. **Day 1**: 
   - The number of people at the beach is given as 50.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 1} = 50
   \]

2. **Day 2**: 
   - It is stated that there were 20 more people present than on the first day. Therefore, we add 20 to the number of people from Day 1.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Day 3**: 
   - The total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. Thus, we multiply the number of people from Day 2 by 2.

   \[
   \text{People on Day 3} = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

4. **Days 4 to 7**: 
   - It is given that Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 4 days remaining in the week (Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, and Day 7), we can calculate the total number of people for these days.

   \[
   \text{Total for Days 4 to 7} = 60 \times 4 = 240
   \]

5. **Total for the Week**: 
   - Now, we will sum the number of people from each day to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

   \[
   \text{Total People} = \text{People on Day 1} + \text{People on Day 2} + \text{People on Day 3} + \text{Total for Days 4 to 7}
   \]

   Plugging in the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total People} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step by step:

   \[
   50 + 70 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 140 = 260
   \]
   \[
   260 + 240 = 500
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
