To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we will calculate the number of classes that visited each day from Monday to Friday and then sum those numbers.

1. **Monday**: The problem states that 32 classes visited on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Classes on Monday} = 32
   \]

2. **Tuesday**: It is stated that twice as many classes visited on Tuesday as on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Classes on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Classes on Monday} = 2 \times 32 = 64
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: The problem indicates that three times as many classes visited on Wednesday as on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Classes on Wednesday} = 3 \times \text{Classes on Monday} = 3 \times 32 = 96
   \]

4. **Thursday**: The problem states that 30 classes visited on Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Classes on Thursday} = 30
   \]

5. **Friday**: Finally, it mentions that 25 classes visited on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Classes on Friday} = 25
   \]

Now, we will sum the number of classes that visited each day to find the total for the week.

\[
\text{Total Classes} = \text{Classes on Monday} + \text{Classes on Tuesday} + \text{Classes on Wednesday} + \text{Classes on Thursday} + \text{Classes on Friday}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Classes} = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  32 + 64 = 96
  \]

- Next, add Wednesday:
  \[
  96 + 96 = 192
  \]

- Then, add Thursday:
  \[
  192 + 30 = 222
  \]

- Finally, add Friday:
  \[
  222 + 25 = 247
  \]

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}
\]
