To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba.**
   We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. Let \( x \) be the number of spots on a mamba. According to the problem:
   \[
   70 = 2x
   \]
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]
   Therefore, a mamba has 35 spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras.**
   There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. The total number of spots for all cobras is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas.**
   There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. The total number of spots for all mambas is:
   \[
   \text{Total spots for mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots for all snakes.**
   Now, we add the total spots for cobras and mambas:
   \[
   \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. **Find half the number of spots they all have combined.**
   To find half of the combined total spots:
   \[
   \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2450}
\]
