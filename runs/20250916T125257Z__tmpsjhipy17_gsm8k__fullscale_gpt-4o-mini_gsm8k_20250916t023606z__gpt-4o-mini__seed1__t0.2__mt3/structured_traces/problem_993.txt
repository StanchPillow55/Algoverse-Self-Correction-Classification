To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Flights of the First Plane:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in one day.
   - According to the problem, three-quarters of these flights go to Greece. Therefore, the number of flights to Greece is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4}x
     \]

2. **Remaining Flights:**
   - The remaining flights, which are not to Greece, can be calculated as:
     \[
     x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
     \]
   - These remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \text{Flights to Germany} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4}x \right) = \frac{1}{8}x
     \]

3. **Understanding the Flights of the Second Plane:**
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips. According to the problem, these 44 trips amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     44 = \frac{1}{2}x
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 44 \times 2 = 88
     \]

5. **Calculating Flights to France:**
   - Now that we know the total number of flights \( x \) for the first plane is 88, we can find the number of flights to France:
     \[
     \text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8}x = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
     \]

Thus, the total number of flights to France that the first plane takes in one day is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
