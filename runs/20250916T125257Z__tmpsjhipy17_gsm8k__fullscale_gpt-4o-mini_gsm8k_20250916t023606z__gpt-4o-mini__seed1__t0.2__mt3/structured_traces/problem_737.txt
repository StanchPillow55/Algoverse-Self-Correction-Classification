To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we will first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water he had.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = Number of giant cubes × Water per giant cube
   \[
   \text{Total water for giant cubes} = 3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces/cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = Number of medium cubes × Water per medium cube
   \[
   \text{Total water for medium cubes} = 7 \text{ cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces/cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the water used for small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = Number of small cubes × Water per small cube
   \[
   \text{Total water for small cubes} = 8 \text{ cubes} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ ounce/cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total water used:**
   - Now we sum the water used for all types of cubes:
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = \text{Total water for giant cubes} + \text{Total water for medium cubes} + \text{Total water for small cubes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining water:**
   - Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Total water used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, after making the ice cubes, Peter has **2 ounces of water left**.

Final answer: **2 ounces**.
