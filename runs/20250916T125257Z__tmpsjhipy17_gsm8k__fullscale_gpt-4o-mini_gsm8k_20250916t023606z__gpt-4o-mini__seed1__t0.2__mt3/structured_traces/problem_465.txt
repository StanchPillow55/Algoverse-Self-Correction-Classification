To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total number of basketball and baseball cards Miss Maria has, then determine how many cards she gives away to her students, and finally calculate how many students she has based on the number of cards each student receives.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of basketball cards

Miss Maria has 6 decks of basketball cards, with each deck containing 25 cards. We can calculate the total number of basketball cards as follows:

\[
\text{Total basketball cards} = \text{Number of decks} \times \text{Cards per deck} = 6 \times 25
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
6 \times 25 = 150
\]

So, Miss Maria has 150 basketball cards.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of baseball cards

Miss Maria also has 5 boxes of baseball cards, with each box containing 40 cards. We can calculate the total number of baseball cards as follows:

\[
\text{Total baseball cards} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cards per box} = 5 \times 40
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
5 \times 40 = 200
\]

So, Miss Maria has 200 baseball cards.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards

Now, we will find the total number of cards by adding the total number of basketball cards and baseball cards:

\[
\text{Total cards} = \text{Total basketball cards} + \text{Total baseball cards} = 150 + 200
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
150 + 200 = 350
\]

So, Miss Maria has a total of 350 cards.

### Step 4: Determine the number of cards given to students

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards for herself. Therefore, the number of cards she gives to her students is:

\[
\text{Cards given to students} = \text{Total cards} - \text{Cards kept} = 350 - 50
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
350 - 50 = 300
\]

So, Miss Maria gives away 300 cards to her students.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of students

Each student receives 10 cards. To find out how many students there are, we divide the total number of cards given to students by the number of cards each student receives:

\[
\text{Number of students} = \frac{\text{Cards given to students}}{\text{Cards per student}} = \frac{300}{10}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{300}{10} = 30
\]

Thus, Miss Maria has 30 students.

### Final Answer

Miss Maria has **30 students**.
