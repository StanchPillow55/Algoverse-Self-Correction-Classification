To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total miles James runs in a week.**
   - James runs 12 miles a day.
   - He runs for 5 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total miles he runs in a week can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total miles per week} = \text{Miles per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 60 \text{ miles/week}
     \]

2. **Determine how many hours he runs in a week.**
   - We know that James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
   - To find out how many hours he runs, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the total distance he runs in a week and his speed into the formula gives us:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, James runs a total of 6 hours in a week.

**Final Answer:**
James runs 6 hours a week.
