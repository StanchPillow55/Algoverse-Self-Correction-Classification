To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet over the 5 minutes of dancing, taking into account the different tap rates for when her arms are raised and when they are not.

### Step 1: Calculate the taps per minute when arms are raised

When Helga raises her arms, she taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute. Therefore, the total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are raised is:

\[
\text{Taps per minute with arms raised} = 200 \text{ (right foot)} + 200 \text{ (left foot)} = 400 \text{ taps per minute}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the taps per minute when arms are at her sides

When her arms are at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. Therefore, the total taps per minute for both feet when her arms are at her sides is:

\[
\text{Taps per minute with arms at sides} = 300 \text{ (right foot)} + 250 \text{ (left foot)} = 550 \text{ taps per minute}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the time spent in each position

Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes. This means she dances with her arms at her sides for the remaining time:

\[
\text{Time with arms raised} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Time with arms at sides} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 2 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total taps for each time period

**Total taps with arms raised (2 minutes):**

\[
\text{Total taps with arms raised} = 400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}
\]

**Total taps with arms at sides (3 minutes):**

\[
\text{Total taps with arms at sides} = 550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the combined total taps

Now, we add the total taps from both time periods to find the combined total:

\[
\text{Combined total taps} = 800 \text{ taps} + 1650 \text{ taps} = 2450 \text{ taps}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes of dancing is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]
