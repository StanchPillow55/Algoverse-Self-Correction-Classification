To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and how many S'mores they can each have with the remaining marshmallows.

1. **Initial Count of Marshmallows:**
   - The bag contains a total of 35 marshmallows.

2. **Marshmallows Used for S'mores:**
   - John makes 9 S'mores, which means he uses 9 marshmallows.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, which means he uses another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

3. **Marshmallows Dropped:**
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

4. **Total Marshmallows Used and Dropped:**
   - Total marshmallows that are no longer available = marshmallows used for S'mores + marshmallows dropped.
   - Total marshmallows no longer available = 18 (used) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows.

5. **Calculating Remaining Marshmallows:**
   - Remaining marshmallows = initial marshmallows - total marshmallows no longer available.
   - Remaining marshmallows = 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows.

6. **Distributing Remaining Marshmallows:**
   - Now we need to determine how many S'mores each kid can have with the remaining marshmallows.
   - Since each S'more requires 1 marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is equal to the number of remaining marshmallows.
   - Therefore, they can make 14 S'mores with the 14 remaining marshmallows.

7. **Final Distribution of S'mores:**
   - If they decide to share the remaining marshmallows equally, each kid can have:
     - S'mores per kid = total remaining marshmallows / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores per kid.

**Final Answer:**
Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.
