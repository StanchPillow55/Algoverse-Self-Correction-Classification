To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of history teachers.**
2. **Calculate the number of math teachers.**
3. **Calculate the total sleep time for math teachers.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of history teachers

We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find the number of history teachers, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \text{ of } 150
\]

First, convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6
\]

Now, multiply by the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.6 \times 150 = 90
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers

To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Number of history teachers}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time for math teachers

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total sleep time for all math teachers, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[
\text{Total sleep time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Sleep hours per teacher}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total sleep time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\boxed{360} \text{ hours}
\]

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of history teachers**:
   - We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers.
   - To find the number of history teachers, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of math teachers**:
   - The rest of the teachers are math teachers. Therefore, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
     \[
     \text{Number of math teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Number of history teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sleeping time for math teachers**:
   - Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total sleeping time for all math teachers, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each sleeps:
     \[
     \text{Total sleeping time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Hours slept per teacher} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is **360 hours**. 

Final answer: **360 hours**.
