To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash instead of the recommended 2 pumps.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of washes with 1 pump
The directions state that 2 pumps of shampoo provide 120 washings. If Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash, we can find out how many washes she can get from the same amount of shampoo.

Since 2 pumps yield 120 washes, using 1 pump means:
\[
\text{Number of washes with 1 pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} \times 1 \text{ pump} = 120 \text{ washes} \times \frac{1}{2} = 240 \text{ washes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the shampoo
The total cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is given as $24.00.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per wash
Now, we need to find the cost per wash when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash. The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00, and she can get 240 washes from it. 

To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of washes}} = \frac{24.00}{240}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00}{240} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per pump
Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash. Therefore, the cost per pump is $0.10.

### Step 5: Convert the cost per pump to cents
To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[
\text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.10 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 10 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer
The cost of each pump, when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, is **10 cents**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

1. **Determine the total number of washes per bottle**:
   According to the problem, the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. 

2. **Calculate the number of washes with 1 pump**:
   If 2 pumps are used for 120 washes, then using 1 pump will double the number of washes:
   \[
   \text{Number of washes with 1 pump} = 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00}{240} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Convert the cost per wash to cost per pump**:
   Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Convert the cost from dollars to cents**:
   To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.10 \times 100 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that each pump costs **10 cents**.
