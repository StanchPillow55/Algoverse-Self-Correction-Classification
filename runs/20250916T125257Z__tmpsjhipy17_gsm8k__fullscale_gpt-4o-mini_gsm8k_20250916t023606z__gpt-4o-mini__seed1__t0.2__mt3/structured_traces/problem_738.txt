To solve the problem, we will define the number of books each person has using variables and then work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books Steven has.
   - According to the problem, Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can express the number of books Alice has as:
     \[
     A = S + 6
     \]
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     C = 2S
     \]

2. **Use the Information Given**:
   - We know that Clara has 20 books:
     \[
     C = 20
     \]
   - Since we have \( C = 2S \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2S = 20
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]
   - So, Steven has 10 books.

4. **Find the Number of Books Alice Has**:
   - Now that we know \( S \), we can find \( A \):
     \[
     A = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Alice has 16 books.

5. **Find the Number of Books Clara Has**:
   - We already know from the problem that Clara has 20 books:
     \[
     C = 20
     \]

6. **Calculate How Many More Books Clara Has Than Alice**:
   - To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of books Alice has from the number of books Clara has:
     \[
     C - A = 20 - 16 = 4
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
