To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones, including the interest, and then determine how much Shiela will pay each month over the 3-month installment period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones

Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. The total cost before interest is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged

The problem states that a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. Since the total cost is $750, we need to calculate the interest on this amount.

The interest can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

In this case:
- Principal = $750
- Rate = 2% = 0.02 (as a decimal)
- Time = 3 months (but since the interest is charged monthly, we will calculate it for each month separately)

Since the interest is charged monthly, we will calculate the interest for each month and then sum it up.

#### Monthly Interest Calculation

For each month, the interest charged will be:

\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Total Cost} \times \text{Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

Since this interest is charged for 3 months, the total interest over 3 months will be:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Monthly Interest} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total Interest} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid

Now, we need to add the total interest to the total cost to find the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[
\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Total Interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = 750 + 45 = 795
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment

Finally, we will divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months (3) to find out how much Shiela will pay each month:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to be Paid}}{\text{Number of Months}}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
\]

### Final Answer

Shiela will pay **$265** each month for 3 months.

To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones over a 3-month installment period with a 2% interest charge, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. We can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged
The interest charged is 2% per month on the total cost. First, we need to calculate the interest for one month:

\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Total Cost} \times \text{Interest Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid each month
The total amount to be paid each month includes the original cost divided by the number of months plus the interest for that month. 

1. **Calculate the principal payment per month:**
   \[
   \text{Principal Payment per Month} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Principal Payment per Month} = \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the total payment for the first month:**
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 1} = \text{Principal Payment per Month} + \text{Monthly Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 1} = 250 + 15 = 265
   \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for the second month:**
   The principal remains the same, but the interest will be calculated on the remaining balance after the first payment. The remaining balance after the first payment is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance after Month 1} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Now calculate the interest on the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest for Month 2} = 500 \times 0.02 = 10
   \]
   Now calculate the total payment for the second month:
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 2} = 250 + 10 = 260
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for the third month:**
   The remaining balance after the second payment is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance after Month 2} = 500 - 250 = 250
   \]
   Now calculate the interest on the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest for Month 3} = 250 \times 0.02 = 5
   \]
   Now calculate the total payment for the third month:
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 3} = 250 + 5 = 255
   \]

### Step 4: Summarize the monthly payments
- Month 1: $265
- Month 2: $260
- Month 3: $255

### Final Calculation: Total Amount Paid
To find the total amount Shiela will pay over the 3 months, we can sum the monthly payments:
\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = 265 + 260 + 255 = 780
\]

### Final Answer
Shiela will pay $265 in the first month, $260 in the second month, and $255 in the third month. The total amount paid over the 3 months will be **$780**.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones, including the interest charged, and then determine how much Shiela will pay each month over the 3-month installment period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones

Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. The total cost before interest is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of phones} \times \text{Cost per phone}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged

The interest charged is 2% per unit (cell phone) for the total cost. First, we need to calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.

The interest for one month on the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly interest} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Interest rate}
\]

\[
\text{Monthly interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

Since the interest is charged for 3 months, we multiply the monthly interest by 3:

\[
\text{Total interest for 3 months} = \text{Monthly interest} \times 3
\]

\[
\text{Total interest for 3 months} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid

Now, we add the total cost of the cell phones and the total interest to find the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Total interest}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 45 = 795
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, so we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be paid}}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
\]

### Final Answer

Shiela will pay **$265** each month for 3 months.
