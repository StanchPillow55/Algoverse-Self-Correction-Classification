To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to determine the total number of stripes and the total number of zebras.

1. **Count the number of zebras and their stripes**:
   - Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
     \[
     2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - There is one zebra with 36 stripes:
     \[
     36 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - There is another zebra with half that many stripes (half of 36):
     \[
     \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of stripes**:
   Now we add all the stripes together:
   \[
   \text{Total stripes} = 34 + 36 + 18
   \]
   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add 34 and 36:
     \[
     34 + 36 = 70
     \]
   - Next, add 18 to the result:
     \[
     70 + 18 = 88
     \]
   Thus, the total number of stripes is:
   \[
   88 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. **Count the total number of zebras**:
   Jane has counted:
   - 2 zebras with 17 stripes,
   - 1 zebra with 36 stripes,
   - 1 zebra with 18 stripes.
   
   Therefore, the total number of zebras is:
   \[
   2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ zebras}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of stripes per zebra**:
   The average number of stripes is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:
   \[
   \text{Average stripes} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Total zebras}} = \frac{88}{4}
   \]
   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The average number of stripes on the zebras is:
   \[
   \boxed{22}
   \]
