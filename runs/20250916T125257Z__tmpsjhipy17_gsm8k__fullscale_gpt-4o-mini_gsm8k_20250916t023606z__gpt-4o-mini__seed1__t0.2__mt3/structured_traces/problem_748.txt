To solve the problem, we will define the number of marbles each person has based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of marbles Sean has:**
   - We are told that Sean has 56 marbles.
   \[
   \text{Sean's marbles} = 56
   \]

2. **Determine the number of marbles Cal has:**
   - The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
   \]
   - Rearranging this equation to find Cal's marbles gives us:
   \[
   \text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
   \]

3. **Determine the number of marbles Carl has:**
   - We are also told that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles}
   \]
   - Substituting Sean's marbles into this equation gives us:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined:**
   - Now we need to find the combined total of Carl's and Cal's marbles:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 336
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is:
   \[
   \boxed{336}
   \]
