To solve the problem of how many people are infected after three days, we need to analyze the spread of the infection step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: We start with 10 infected people.

2. **Daily Infection Rate**: Each infected person infects 6 new people every day.

3. **Calculating Daily Infections**:
   - **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
   - **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 1} = 10 \times 6 = 60
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 1:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 10 + 60 = 70
     \]

   - **Day 2**: Now, we have 70 infected people (the original 10 plus the 60 new ones). Each of these 70 infected people will infect 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 2} = 70 \times 6 = 420
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 2:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 70 + 420 = 490
     \]

   - **Day 3**: Now, we have 490 infected people. Each of these will infect 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 3} = 490 \times 6 = 2940
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 3:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 490 + 2940 = 3430
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**: After three days, the total number of infected people is 3430.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3430}
\]
