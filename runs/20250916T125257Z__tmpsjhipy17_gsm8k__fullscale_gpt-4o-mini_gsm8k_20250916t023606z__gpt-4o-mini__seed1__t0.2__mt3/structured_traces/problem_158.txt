To find out how much Raphael spent on his school supplies, we will calculate the total cost of each type of item he purchased and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - Each pen costs $1.50.
   - The total cost for the pens can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pens} = \text{Number of pens} \times \text{Cost per pen} = 4 \times 1.50
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     4 \times 1.50 = 6.00
     \]
   - So, the total cost of the pens is **$6.00**.

2. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - Each notebook costs $4.00.
   - The total cost for the notebooks can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of notebooks} = \text{Number of notebooks} \times \text{Cost per notebook} = 2 \times 4
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8.00
     \]
   - So, the total cost of the notebooks is **$8.00**.

3. **Calculate the cost of the rim of bond paper:**
   - Raphael bought 1 rim of bond paper.
   - The cost of the rim of bond paper is $20.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the bond paper is simply:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of bond paper} = 20.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now, we will sum the total costs of all the items:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of pens} + \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of bond paper}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 6.00 + 8.00 + 20.00
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     6.00 + 8.00 = 14.00
     \]
     \[
     14.00 + 20.00 = 34.00
     \]

Thus, the total amount Raphael spent on everything is **$34.00**. 

Final answer: **$34.00**.
