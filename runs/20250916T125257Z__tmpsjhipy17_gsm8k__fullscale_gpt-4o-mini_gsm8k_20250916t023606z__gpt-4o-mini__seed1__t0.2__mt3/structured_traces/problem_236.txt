To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total pens Ram can have by mixing the ink from the empty pens he has after using them.

1. **Initial Purchase**: Ram buys 25 pens. This is our starting point.

2. **Using the Pens**: As Ram uses the pens, they will eventually become empty. For every 5 empty pens, he can mix the ink to create 1 new full pen.

3. **Calculating New Pens from Empty Pens**:
   - After using the 25 pens, Ram will have 25 empty pens.
   - To find out how many new pens he can create from these empty pens, we divide the number of empty pens by 5:
     \[
     \text{New pens} = \frac{\text{Empty pens}}{5} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
     \]

4. **Total Pens After Mixing**: Now, we need to add the new pens to the original number of pens:
   \[
   \text{Total pens} = \text{Original pens} + \text{New pens} = 25 + 5 = 30 \text{ pens}
   \]

5. **Using the New Pens**: After creating 5 new pens, Ram will again use these pens until they are empty. Once he uses the 5 new pens, he will have 5 empty pens.

6. **Creating More New Pens**: Now, we can again create new pens from these 5 empty pens:
   \[
   \text{New pens from 5 empty pens} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
   \]

7. **Total Pens After Second Mixing**: We add this new pen to the total:
   \[
   \text{Total pens} = 30 + 1 = 31 \text{ pens}
   \]

8. **Final Calculation**: Ram now has 31 pens in total after mixing the ink from the empty pens.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
