To solve the problem, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother and then find out how old he will be in 3 years.

1. **Determine Ann's current age**: 
   - Ann is currently 9 years old.

2. **Determine Ann's brother's current age**: 
   - The problem states that Ann's brother is twice her age. 
   - Therefore, we calculate his age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate the brother's age in 3 years**: 
   - To find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
