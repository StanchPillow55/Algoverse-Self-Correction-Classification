To find Trinity's profit from selling the magazines, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the selling price of the magazines**: 
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. Since she bought the magazines for $72, we can calculate the selling price as follows:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

   To perform the multiplication, we can first simplify \( 72 \) as a fraction:

   \[
   72 = \frac{72}{1}
   \]

   Now, we multiply:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]

   Next, we can simplify \( \frac{72}{8} \):

   \[
   \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

   Therefore, we have:

   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

2. **Calculate the profit**:
   Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 27
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   Trinity's profit from selling the magazines is \( \boxed{27} \).
