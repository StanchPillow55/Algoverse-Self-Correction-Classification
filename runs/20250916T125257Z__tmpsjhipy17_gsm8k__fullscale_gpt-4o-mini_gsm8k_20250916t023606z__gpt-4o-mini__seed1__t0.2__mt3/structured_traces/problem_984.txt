To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the dimensions to the same unit**: 
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. Since the flowers grow 12 inches wide and we need to leave space between them, we will convert everything to feet. 
   - 12 inches = 12/12 = 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: 
   Each plant occupies 1 foot (width of the plant) plus 1.5 feet (space between plants). 
   - Total space per plant = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: 
   We will divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies.
   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}}.
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4.
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   - Maximum number of plants = 44.

4. **Calculate how many additional plants Pat needs**: 
   Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more she needs to buy:
   \[
   \text{Additional plants needed} = \text{Maximum number of plants} - \text{Plants owned} = 44 - 17 = 27.
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants**: 
   Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Additional plants needed} \times \text{Cost per plant} = 27 \times 6.
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   27 \times 6 = 162.
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   Pat will spend a total of $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost of those plants.

### Step 1: Convert Measurements
First, we need to ensure all measurements are in the same unit. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and the width of each flower is given in inches. We will convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.

- **Width of each flower**: 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

### Step 2: Calculate the Space Required for Each Plant
Each plant occupies its width plus the space needed between plants. Since each plant is 1 foot wide and there is a 1.5-foot gap between each plant, the total space required for each plant is:

- **Space per plant** = Width of plant + Space between plants
- **Space per plant** = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet

### Step 3: Determine How Many Plants Fit in the Flower Bed
Next, we will calculate how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed.

- **Number of plants that can fit** = Total length of flower bed / Space per plant
- **Number of plants that can fit** = 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:

- **Number of plants that can fit** = 44 plants

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Additional Plants Needed
Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more plants she needs to buy.

- **Additional plants needed** = Total plants that can fit - Plants already owned
- **Additional plants needed** = 44 - 17 = 27 plants

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Cost
Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional plants is:

- **Total cost** = Additional plants needed × Cost per plant
- **Total cost** = 27 plants × $6/plant = $162

### Final Answer
Pat will spend **$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed.

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Convert the length of the flower bed to inches**: Since the width of the flowers is given in inches, we should convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

   \[
   1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} = 111 \times 12 = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total space each flower occupies**: Each flower has a width of 12 inches, and Pat needs to leave a space of 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each flower. Therefore, the total space occupied by each flower, including the space between them, is:

   \[
   \text{Space per flower} = \text{Width of flower} + \text{Space between flowers} = 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**: To find out how many flowers can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the total space occupied by each flower:

   \[
   \text{Number of flowers} = \frac{\text{Total length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per flower}} = \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches}} \approx 44.4
   \]

   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:

   \[
   \text{Number of flowers that can be planted} = 44
   \]

4. **Calculate how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more flowers she needs to buy:

   \[
   \text{Additional flowers needed} = \text{Total flowers needed} - \text{Flowers owned} = 44 - 17 = 27
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Additional flowers needed} \times \text{Cost per flower} = 27 \times 6 = 162
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]

Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.
