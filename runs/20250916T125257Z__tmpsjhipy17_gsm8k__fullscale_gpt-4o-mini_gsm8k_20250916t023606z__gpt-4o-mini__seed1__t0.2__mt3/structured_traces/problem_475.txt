To solve the problem, we need to determine how many minutes Jason needs to walk each day in order to break in his new shoes before trying out for the track team.

1. **Total Time Required**: We know that it takes 240 minutes of walking to break in the shoes.

2. **Time Frame**: Jason has three weeks to break in the shoes. We need to convert this time frame into days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we calculate the total number of days in three weeks:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Walking Days**: Jason can walk 4 days a week. To find out how many walking days he has in three weeks, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 12 \text{ walking days}
   \]

4. **Daily Walking Time**: Now, we need to find out how many minutes he needs to walk each day to accumulate a total of 240 minutes over the 12 walking days. We do this by dividing the total time required by the number of walking days:
   \[
   \text{Daily walking time} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{12 \text{ walking days}} = 20 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, Jason needs to spend **20 minutes walking each day** to break in his new shoes before the track team tryouts.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20 \text{ minutes}}
\]
