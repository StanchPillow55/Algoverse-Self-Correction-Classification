To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one day**:
   - Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.
   - She uploads 6 batches each day.
   - Therefore, the total number of photos uploaded in one day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Photos per day} = \text{Photos per batch} \times \text{Number of batches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Photos per day} = 7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of days needed to upload all photos**:
   - Jade has a total of 210 photos to upload.
   - To find out how many days it will take to upload all the photos, we divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
     \[
     \text{Total days needed} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Photos per day}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total days needed} = \frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Jade will need a total of 5 days to upload all of her photos.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
