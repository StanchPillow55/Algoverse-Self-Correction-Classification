To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need for his garden fence, we first need to calculate the total perimeter of the rectangular area that he is enclosing.

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden:**
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]
   In this case, the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging in these values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (15 \text{ ft} + 10 \text{ ft}) = 2 \times 25 \text{ ft} = 50 \text{ ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of wood slats needed:**
   According to the problem, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds. Since we have calculated the perimeter to be 50 feet, we can find the total number of slats needed by multiplying the perimeter by the number of slats per foot:
   \[
   \text{Total slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Slats per foot} = 50 \text{ ft} \times 2 \text{ slats/ft} = 100 \text{ slats}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of wooden slats Robert will need for his fence is:
   \[
   \boxed{100}
   \]
