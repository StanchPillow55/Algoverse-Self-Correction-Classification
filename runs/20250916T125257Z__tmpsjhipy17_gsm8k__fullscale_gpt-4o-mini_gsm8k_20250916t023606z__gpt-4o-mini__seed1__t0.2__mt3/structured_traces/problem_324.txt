To solve the problem, we need to understand the trading system at Ralph's record store. The key points are:

1. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
2. 5 people come in and leave with a total of 7 new records.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since the trading system allows for 2 old records to be exchanged for 1 new record, we can express the number of new records obtained from the old records as follows:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{\text{Number of old records}}{2}
\]

Given that the total number of new records obtained is 7, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

To verify, we can check how many new records they would receive from 14 old records:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, given that they traded 2 old records for 1 new record and left with a total of 7 new records.

1. **Understanding the trade ratio**: Each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record received, 2 old records must be given.

2. **Calculating the total number of old records needed for the new records**: Since the 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they must have traded in to receive those new records.

   The formula to find the number of old records needed is:
   \[
   \text{Old records needed} = \text{New records} \times 2
   \]
   Substituting the number of new records:
   \[
   \text{Old records needed} = 7 \times 2 = 14
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

Final answer: **14 old records**.
