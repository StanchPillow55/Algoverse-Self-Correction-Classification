To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined.

1. **Calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday:**
   - Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
   - Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday:**
   - Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined. Therefore, we multiply the total time by 2:
   \[
   \text{Time on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Now we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Peter needs to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]
