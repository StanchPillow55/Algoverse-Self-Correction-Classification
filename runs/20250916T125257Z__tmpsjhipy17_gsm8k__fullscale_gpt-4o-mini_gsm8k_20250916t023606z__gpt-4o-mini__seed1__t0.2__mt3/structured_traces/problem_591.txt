To solve the problem, we will determine the weight of each dog step by step, starting from the Affenpinscher and moving to the Mastiff.

1. **Weight of the Affenpinscher**:
   - The problem states that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Affenpinscher} = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Weight of the Dachshund**:
   - The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Dachshund} = 2 \times \text{Weight of Affenpinscher} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight of the Papillon**:
   - The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Papillon} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Dachshund} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight of the Mastiff**:
   - The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.
   \[
   \text{Weight of Mastiff} = 44 \times \text{Weight of Papillon} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we have calculated the weights of all the dogs:
- Affenpinscher: 10 pounds
- Dachshund: 20 pounds
- Papillon: 5 pounds
- Mastiff: 220 pounds

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The Mastiff weighs } 220 \text{ pounds.}
\]
