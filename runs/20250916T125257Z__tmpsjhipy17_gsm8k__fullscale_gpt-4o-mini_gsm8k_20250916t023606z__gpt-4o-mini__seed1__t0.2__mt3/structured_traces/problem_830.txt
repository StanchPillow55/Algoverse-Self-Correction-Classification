To determine how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on filming her videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent filming TikTok videos

Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. 

First, we calculate the total time spent filming in one week:

\[
\text{Time spent filming in one week} = \text{Number of videos} \times \text{Duration of each video}
\]
\[
\text{Time spent filming in one week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time spent filming in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent filming in four weeks} = \text{Time spent filming in one week} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent filming in four weeks} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent writing songs

Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time into minutes for consistency:

\[
\text{Time spent writing songs in one week} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time spent writing songs in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent writing songs in four weeks} = 120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent doing makeup

Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week. First, we calculate the total time spent on makeup in one week:

\[
\text{Time spent doing makeup in one week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we calculate the total time spent doing makeup in four weeks:

\[
\text{Total time spent doing makeup in four weeks} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok

Now we can sum all the time spent on filming, writing songs, and doing makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok in a month:

\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = \text{Total time filming} + \text{Total time writing songs} + \text{Total time doing makeup}
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total time spent on TikTok} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.

     18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on videos is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}

     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   - Now, we add all the time spent on videos, songwriting, and makeup:
     \[
     288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
