To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Sasha's score in the first game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.

2. **Determine Julie's score in the first game:**
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we calculate Julie's score as follows:
   \[
   \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Determine Sasha's score in the second game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points. Thus, we calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:
   \[
   \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total points scored by Sasha during both games:**
   - Now we add Sasha's scores from both games:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, the total points that Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the points scored by Sasha and Julie in both games.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we calculate Julie's score as follows:
     \[
     \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already know that Julie scored 10 points in the first game. Therefore, we calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Scored by Sasha:**
   - Now we will find the total points scored by Sasha during both games. We add her scores from the first and second games:
     \[
     \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the scores for both Sasha and Julie in each game.

### Step 1: Determine Sasha's score in the first game.
Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.

### Step 2: Determine Julie's score in the first game.
Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Therefore, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10
\]

### Step 3: Determine Sasha's score in the second game.
In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points. Thus, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:

\[
\text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total points scored by Sasha during both games.
Now we will add Sasha's scores from both games to find the total points scored:

\[
\text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18
\]

### Final Answer
Sasha scored a total of **18 points** during both games.
