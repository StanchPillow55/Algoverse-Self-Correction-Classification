Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these statements into equations.

### Step 1: Set up the equations

From the first statement:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

From the second statement:
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age is \( W \).
- The equation from this statement is:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

We can substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

First, simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 5: Find \( W \)

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

1. Check the first condition:
   - Colin's age in 7 years: \( 20 + 7 = 27 \)
   - Wendy's age should be \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \), which matches our calculation.

2. Check the second condition:
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( 20 + 25 = 45 \)
   - Wendy's current age is \( 135 \).
   - One third of Wendy's age: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \), which matches.

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer

Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

### Step 1: Set up the equations

From the first piece of information, we can express it mathematically:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:
  \[
  W = 5(C + 7)
  \]
  
From the second piece of information, we can express it as:
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age is \( W \).
- Thus, we have:
  \[
  C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
  \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

Now, simplify the right-hand side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Distributing both sides gives:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)

Now, rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]
\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 5: Find \( W \)

Now that we have Colin's current age, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

1. **Check the first condition**:
   - Colin's age in 7 years: \( 20 + 7 = 27 \)
   - Wendy's age: \( 135 \)
   - Check: \( 135 = 5 \times 27 \) (True)

2. **Check the second condition**:
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( 20 + 25 = 45 \)
   - Wendy's current age: \( 135 \)
   - Check: \( 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \) (True)

Both conditions are satisfied.

Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.

To solve the problem, we will define variables for the ages of Wendy and Colin, set up equations based on the information given, and then solve those equations step by step.

Let:
- \( C \) = Colin's current age
- \( W \) = Wendy's current age

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the problem statements.

1. **First statement**: "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."
   - In seven years, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - According to the statement, Wendy's age \( W \) is five times that:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. **Second statement**: "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - According to the statement, this age will be one third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

### Step 2: Rewrite the equations.

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

From the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \).

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 5C - 3C + 35
\]
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
75 - 35 = 2C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 6: Find Wendy's age using \( C \).

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

### Verification

1. **Check the first statement**:
   - In 7 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
   - Wendy's age should be \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \). This is consistent with our calculation.

2. **Check the second statement**:
   - In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
   - One third of Wendy's current age \( 135 \) is \( \frac{135}{3} = 45 \). This is also consistent.

Both statements hold true, confirming that our solution is correct. Colin is indeed \( \boxed{20} \) years old.
