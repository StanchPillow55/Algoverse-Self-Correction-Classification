To determine how many feet of new line the caretaker needs to buy, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total amount of line needed for the dock:**
   The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. Given that there is 200 feet of dock, we can calculate the total line needed as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = \text{Length of dock} \times \text{Line per foot of dock}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total line needed} = 200 \text{ feet} \times 3 \text{ feet/foot} = 600 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine how much line the caretaker currently has:**
   The caretaker currently has 6 feet of new line.

3. **Calculate how much additional line is needed:**
   To find out how much more line the caretaker needs to buy, we subtract the amount of line he currently has from the total line needed:

   \[
   \text{Additional line needed} = \text{Total line needed} - \text{Current line}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional line needed} = 600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The caretaker needs to buy a total of 594 feet of new line.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{594 \text{ feet}}
\]
