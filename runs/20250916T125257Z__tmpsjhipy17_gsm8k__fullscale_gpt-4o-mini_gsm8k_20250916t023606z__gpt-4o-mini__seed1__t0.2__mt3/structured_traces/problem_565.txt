To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches.

1. **Identify the total number of sandwiches**: 
   - Cody and Trevor had a total of 12 sandwiches.

2. **Calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate**:
   - Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. 
   - To find a third of 12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cody's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]

3. **Calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate**:
   - Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.
   - To find a quarter of 12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by both**:
   - Now we add the number of sandwiches eaten by Cody and Trevor:
     \[
     \text{Total eaten} = \text{Cody's sandwiches} + \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]

5. **Calculate how many sandwiches are left**:
   - We subtract the total number of sandwiches eaten from the original total:
     \[
     \text{Sandwiches left} = \text{Total sandwiches} - \text{Total eaten} = 12 - 7 = 5
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **5 sandwiches left**.
