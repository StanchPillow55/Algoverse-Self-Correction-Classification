To determine how many total times both DVDs can be played before they break, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of plays each DVD can handle**: Each DVD can be played a maximum of 1000 times.

2. **Determine how many times each DVD has already been played**:
   - The first DVD has been played 356 times.
   - The second DVD has been played 135 times.

3. **Calculate the remaining plays for each DVD**:
   - For the first DVD:
     \[
     \text{Remaining plays for DVD 1} = 1000 - 356 = 644
     \]
   - For the second DVD:
     \[
     \text{Remaining plays for DVD 2} = 1000 - 135 = 865
     \]

4. **Calculate the total remaining plays for both DVDs**:
   - We add the remaining plays of both DVDs:
     \[
     \text{Total remaining plays} = \text{Remaining plays for DVD 1} + \text{Remaining plays for DVD 2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total remaining plays} = 644 + 865
     \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   644 + 865 = 1509
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break is 1509.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1509}
\]
