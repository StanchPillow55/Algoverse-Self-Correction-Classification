To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we will first calculate the cost of each type of item separately and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of the erasers:**
   - The cost of one eraser is $2.
   - We need to find the cost for 6 erasers.
   - The total cost for the erasers can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of erasers} = \text{Number of erasers} \times \text{Cost per eraser}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of erasers} = 6 \times 2 = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for 6 erasers is $12.

2. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - The cost of one pencil is $3.
   - We need to find the cost for 8 pencils.
   - The total cost for the pencils can be calculated using the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pencils} = 8 \times 3 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for 8 pencils is $24.

3. **Calculate the total cost for both erasers and pencils:**
   - Now we will add the total cost of the erasers and the total cost of the pencils:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of erasers} + \text{Total cost of pencils}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 12 + 24 = 36
     \]

Thus, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is **$36**.

Final answer: **$36**.
