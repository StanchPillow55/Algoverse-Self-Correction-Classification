To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we can break the problem down into steps and perform the calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers**: Jasmine starts with 15 stickers for participating in class.
   \[
   \text{Initial Stickers} = 15
   \]

2. **Stickers Lost**: During playtime, Jasmine loses 7 stickers.
   \[
   \text{Stickers Lost} = 7
   \]

3. **Calculating Stickers After Loss**: To find out how many stickers Jasmine has after losing some, we subtract the number of stickers lost from the initial number of stickers.
   \[
   \text{Stickers After Loss} = \text{Initial Stickers} - \text{Stickers Lost} = 15 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Stickers After Loss} = 8
   \]

4. **Stickers Gained**: Jasmine's teacher gives her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.
   \[
   \text{Stickers Gained} = 5
   \]

5. **Calculating Final Stickers**: Now, we add the stickers gained to the number of stickers she has after losing some.
   \[
   \text{Final Stickers} = \text{Stickers After Loss} + \text{Stickers Gained} = 8 + 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Stickers} = 13
   \]

Thus, after all the calculations, Jasmine has a total of **13 stickers** at the end.

Final Answer: **13 stickers**.
