To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of people at each stage of the hiring process.

1. **Total Applicants**: There are 100 people who apply for the job.

2. **Interviews**: We know that only 30% of the applicants receive interviews. To find the number of people who receive interviews, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of interviews} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]

3. **Job Offers**: Out of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. We calculate the number of job offers as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of job offers} = 30 \times 0.20 = 6
   \]

4. **Acceptances**: Finally, of those who receive a job offer, one third accept the position. We calculate the number of people who accept the job offer:
   \[
   \text{Number of acceptances} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:
- 100 applicants → 30% receive interviews → 30 people interviewed
- 30 interviewed → 20% receive job offers → 6 job offers made
- 6 job offers → 1/3 accept the position → 2 people accept the position

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
