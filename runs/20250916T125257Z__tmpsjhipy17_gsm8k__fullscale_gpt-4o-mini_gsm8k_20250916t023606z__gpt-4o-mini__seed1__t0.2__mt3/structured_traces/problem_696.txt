To solve the problem, we will calculate the points collected by each student step by step and then determine how many points the class is missing to reach the threshold of 400 points.

1. **Calculate Betty's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - To find 30% of Adam's points:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, Betty's total points are:
     \[
     \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
     \]

2. **Calculate Tom's Points:**
   - We know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Since Betty has 65 points, Tom's points are:
     \[
     \text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
     \]

3. **Calculate Martha's Points:**
   - Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Martha's points are:
     \[
     \text{Martha's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Points Collected by the Class:**
   - Now we can sum the points collected by all four students:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Martha's points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
     \]

5. **Determine How Many Points the Class is Missing:**
   - The class needs a minimum of 400 points to go on the trip.
   - To find out how many points they are missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:
     \[
     \text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
     \]

Thus, the class is missing **145 points** to reach the threshold of 400 points for the trip.

**Final Answer: 145 points**
