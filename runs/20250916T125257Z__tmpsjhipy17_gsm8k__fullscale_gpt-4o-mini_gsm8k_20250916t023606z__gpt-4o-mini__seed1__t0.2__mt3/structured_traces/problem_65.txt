To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Jim spends watching TV and reading over a period of 4 weeks.

1. **Calculate the time spent on TV in one session:**
   Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.

2. **Calculate the time spent reading in one session:**
   Jim reads for half as long as he watches TV. Therefore, the time spent reading is:
   \[
   \text{Time spent reading} = \frac{2 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent in one session (TV + reading):**
   The total time spent in one session is the sum of the time spent watching TV and the time spent reading:
   \[
   \text{Total time per session} = \text{Time spent watching TV} + \text{Time spent reading} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time spent in one week:**
   Jim does this activity 3 times a week. Therefore, the total time spent in one week is:
   \[
   \text{Total time per week} = 3 \text{ sessions} \times 3 \text{ hours per session} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total time spent in 4 weeks:**
   To find the total time spent over 4 weeks, we multiply the total time spent in one week by 4:
   \[
   \text{Total time in 4 weeks} = 9 \text{ hours per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{36} \text{ hours}
\]
