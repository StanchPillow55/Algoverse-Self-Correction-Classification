To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir:**
   The choir has a total of 52 members, and it is stated that 50% of the members are girls. 

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 52 = \frac{50}{100} \times 52 = 26
   \]

   So, there are 26 girls in the choir.

2. **Determine the number of girls who can perform:**
   On the day of the performance, it is mentioned that half of the girls cannot make it to the show because their bus breaks down. 

   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
   \]

   Therefore, the number of girls who can perform is:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
   \]

3. **Include the teachers in the performance:**
   The problem states that the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the girls who can perform. 

   \[
   \text{Total performers} = \text{Number of girls who can perform} + \text{Number of teachers} = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Thus, the total number of people who sang in the performance is:

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
