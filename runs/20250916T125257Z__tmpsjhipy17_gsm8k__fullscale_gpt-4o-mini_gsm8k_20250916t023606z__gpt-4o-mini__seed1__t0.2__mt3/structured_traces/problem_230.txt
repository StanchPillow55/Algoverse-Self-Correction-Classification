To find out how much Mark pays for everything when he buys a fleet of 12 cars, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   Each car costs $20,000. Since Mark buys 12 cars, we can calculate the total cost of the cars as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Cost per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   Mark pays a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. We can calculate the tax amount as follows:

   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration:**
   Mark also pays $1,000 for registration for each car. We can calculate the total registration cost as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Registration cost per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   Now we can find the total amount Mark pays by adding the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the total registration cost:

   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[
\boxed{276,000}
\]

To determine the total amount Mark pays for the fleet of cars, we need to break down the costs into several components: the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees. Let's go through each step carefully.

1. **Calculate the cost of the cars:**
   Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. Therefore, the total cost of the cars can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Cost per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   Mark pays a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. To find the tax amount, we can use the following formula:

   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the registration fees:**
   Mark also pays $1,000 for registration for each car. Therefore, the total registration fees can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total registration fees} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Registration fee per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total registration fees} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   Now, we can find the total amount Mark pays by adding the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees together:

   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration fees}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the final total amount that Mark pays for everything is:

\[
\boxed{276,000}
\]

To find out how much Mark pays for everything related to the purchase of the fleet of cars, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   - Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
   - Total cost of the cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - To find the total tax, we multiply the total cost of the cars by the tax rate.
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration:**
   - The registration fee is $1,000 per car.
   - Total registration cost = Number of cars × Registration fee per car
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost including tax and registration:**
   - The total cost will be the sum of the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration costs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is **$276,000**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{276,000}
\]
