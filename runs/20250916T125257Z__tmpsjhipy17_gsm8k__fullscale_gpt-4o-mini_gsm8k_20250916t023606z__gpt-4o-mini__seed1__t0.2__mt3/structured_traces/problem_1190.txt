To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day. We will break down the information given day by day and set up an equation to find the initial quantity of bandages.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( x \) be the number of bandages the nurses started with on the first day.

### Step 2: Analyze Day 1
- **Bandages used**: 38
- **Bandages ordered**: 1 bulk pack of 50

At the end of Day 1, the total number of bandages they have is:
\[
\text{End of Day 1} = x - 38 + 50 = x + 12
\]

### Step 3: Analyze Day 2
- **Bandages used**: 10 fewer than Day 1, which is \( 38 - 10 = 28 \)

At the end of Day 2, the total number of bandages they have is:
\[
\text{End of Day 2} = (x + 12) - 28 = x - 16
\]

### Step 4: Analyze Day 3
- **Bandages ordered**: 2 bulk packs of 50, which is \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \)
- **Bandages used**: Half a pack, which is \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)

At the end of Day 3, the total number of bandages they have is:
\[
\text{End of Day 3} = (x - 16) + 100 - 25 = x - 16 + 75 = x + 59
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation
According to the problem, they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day:
\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we will isolate it:
\[
x = 78 - 59
\]
\[
x = 19
\]

### Final Answer
The nurses started with **19 bandages** on the first day.
