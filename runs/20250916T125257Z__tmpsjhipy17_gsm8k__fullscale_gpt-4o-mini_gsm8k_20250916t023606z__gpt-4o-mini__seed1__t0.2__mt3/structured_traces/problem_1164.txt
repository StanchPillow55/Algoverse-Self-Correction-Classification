To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Determine the total number of eggs Cole hid:**
   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many eggs Lamar found:**
   Lamar found 5 eggs.

3. **Calculate how many eggs Stacy found:**
   Stacy found twice as many eggs as Lamar. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Stacy's eggs} = 2 \times \text{Lamar's eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many eggs Charlie found:**
   Charlie found 2 less than Stacy. Thus, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Charlie's eggs} = \text{Stacy's eggs} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many eggs Mei found:**
   Mei found half as many eggs as Charlie. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Mei's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Charlie's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of eggs found:**
   Now, we add up the number of eggs found by Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = \text{Lamar's eggs} + \text{Stacy's eggs} + \text{Charlie's eggs} + \text{Mei's eggs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
   \]

7. **Calculate how many eggs are still hidden in the yard:**
   To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs Cole hid:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = \text{Total eggs hidden} - \text{Total eggs found}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Finally, the number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
