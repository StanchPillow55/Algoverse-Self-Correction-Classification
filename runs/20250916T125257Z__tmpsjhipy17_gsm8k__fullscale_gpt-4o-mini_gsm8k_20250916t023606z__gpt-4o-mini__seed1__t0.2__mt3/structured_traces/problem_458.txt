To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of puppies.**
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Total puppies = Jennifer's puppies + Brandon's puppies
   \[
   \text{Total puppies} = 8 + 12 = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of puppies with spots.**
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Total puppies with spots = Jennifer's spotted puppies + Brandon's spotted puppies
   \[
   \text{Total puppies with spots} = 3 + 4 = 7
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots.**
   - The formula for percentage is given by:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation.**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{7}{20} \):
   \[
   \frac{7}{20} = 0.35
   \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.35 \times 100 = 35
   \]

Thus, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is \( \boxed{35} \).
