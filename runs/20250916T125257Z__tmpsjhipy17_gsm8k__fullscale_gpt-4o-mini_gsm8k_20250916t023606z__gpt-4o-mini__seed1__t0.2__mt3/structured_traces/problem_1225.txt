To solve the problem, we need to define some variables and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - Let \( b \) represent the number of brownies Carly makes.

2. **Set Up the Relationship**:
   According to the problem, Carly makes "2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes." This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2
   \]

3. **Determine Total Treats**:
   Carly's class has 5 people, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total treats} = 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ treats/person} = 10 \text{ treats}
   \]

4. **Set Up the Total Treats Equation**:
   The total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is given by:
   \[
   c + b = 10
   \]

5. **Substitute the Relationship into the Total Treats Equation**:
   We can substitute the expression for \( b \) from step 2 into the total treats equation:
   \[
   c + (3c - 2) = 10
   \]

6. **Simplify the Equation**:
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   c + 3c - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   4c - 2 = 10
   \]

7. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   4c = 12
   \]
   Now divide by 4:
   \[
   c = 3
   \]

8. **Find the Number of Brownies**:
   Now that we have \( c \), we can find \( b \) using the relationship we established earlier:
   \[
   b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

9. **Check the Total**:
   We should check if the total number of treats is correct:
   \[
   c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
   \]
   This matches the total treats needed.

Thus, the number of cupcakes Carly made is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cupcakes Carly made based on the information provided about the number of treats and the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Carly's class has 5 people.
   - Each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total treats} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Treats per person} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ treats}
     \]

2. **Setting up the relationship between cupcakes and brownies**:
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]
   where \( b \) is the number of brownies.

3. **Total treats equation**:
   - The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

4. **Substituting the expression for brownies**:
   - We can substitute \( b \) from the previous equation into the total treats equation:
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

5. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]

6. **Solving for \( c \)**:
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

7. **Finding the number of brownies**:
   - Now that we know \( c = 3 \), we can find \( b \):
     \[
     b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
     \]

8. **Verifying the total treats**:
   - Check if the total number of treats equals 10:
     \[
     c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are correct.

9. **Final answer**:
   - The number of cupcakes Carly made is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Carly makes brownies and cupcakes.
   - The number of brownies she makes is described as "2 less than three times as many cupcakes."
   - There are 5 people in the class, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. **Setting Up the Equations**:
   - Let \(c\) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - According to the problem, the number of brownies \(b\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]
   - The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]
