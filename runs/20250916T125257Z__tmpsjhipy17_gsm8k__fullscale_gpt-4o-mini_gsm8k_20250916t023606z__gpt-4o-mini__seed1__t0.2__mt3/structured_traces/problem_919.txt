To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**
   - Each of the 30 students sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - Total lollipops sold = Number of students × Average lollipops sold per student
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**
   - Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   - Total revenue = Total lollipops sold × Price per lollipop
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.8 = 240
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the lollipops.**
   - Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   - Total cost = Total lollipops sold × Cost per lollipop
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150
   \]

4. **Calculate the total profit.**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 240 - 150 = 90
   \]

Thus, the class was able to raise **$90** from the profit of selling lollipops.

Final answer: **$90**
