To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, both at their discounted prices, and then compare that to the original prices to find out how much we save.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the ice cream

1. **Original price of one tub of ice cream**: $13
2. **Discounted price of one tub of ice cream**: $11

**Savings per tub of ice cream**:
\[
\text{Savings per tub} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discounted price} = 13 - 11 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream**:
\[
\text{Total savings for 2 tubs} = 2 \text{ tubs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/tub} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the milk

1. **Original price of one packet of milk**: Let's denote this as \( P \).
2. **Discount on one packet of milk**: $0.5
3. **Discounted price of one packet of milk**: \( P - 0.5 \)

Since the original price of the milk is not given, we cannot calculate the exact savings for the milk without knowing \( P \). However, we can still express the savings in terms of \( P \).

**Savings per packet of milk**:
\[
\text{Savings per packet} = 0.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total savings for 4 packets of milk**:
\[
\text{Total savings for 4 packets} = 4 \text{ packets} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/packet} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the savings

Now, we can combine the savings from both the ice cream and the milk:

**Total savings**:
\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Savings from ice cream} + \text{Savings from milk} = 4 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount saved by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ dollars}}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, both at their discounted prices, and then compare that to the original prices to determine the savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ice cream

1. **Original price of one tub of ice cream**: $13
2. **Discounted price of one tub of ice cream**: $11
3. **Number of tubs to buy**: 2

**Total cost for ice cream**:
\[
\text{Total cost for ice cream} = \text{Number of tubs} \times \text{Discounted price per tub}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for ice cream} = 2 \times 11 = 22
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of milk

1. **Original price of one packet of milk**: Let's denote the original price as \( P \).
2. **Discount on one packet of milk**: $0.5
3. **Discounted price of one packet of milk**: \( P - 0.5 \)
4. **Number of packets to buy**: 4

**Total cost for milk**:
\[
\text{Total cost for milk} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Discounted price per packet}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for milk} = 4 \times (P - 0.5) = 4P - 2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the purchase

**Total cost for both ice cream and milk**:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for ice cream} + \text{Total cost for milk}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 22 + (4P - 2) = 4P + 20
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the original total cost

**Original total cost for 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk**:
\[
\text{Original cost for ice cream} = 2 \times 13 = 26
\]
\[
\text{Original cost for milk} = 4 \times P = 4P
\]
\[
\text{Original total cost} = 26 + 4P
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the savings

**Savings**:
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Original total cost} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = (26 + 4P) - (4P + 20)
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 26 + 4P - 4P - 20
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 26 - 20 = 6
\]

### Final Answer

The total savings when buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is **$6**.
