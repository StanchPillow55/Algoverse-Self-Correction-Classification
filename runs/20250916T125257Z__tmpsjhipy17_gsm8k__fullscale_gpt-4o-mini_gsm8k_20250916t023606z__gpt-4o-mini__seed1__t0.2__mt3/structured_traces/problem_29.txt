To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the boots based on the information provided about the high heels.

1. **Identify the cost of the high heels:**
   - One pair of heels costs $33.
   - The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair. Therefore, the cost of the second pair is:
     \[
     2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:**
   - The total cost of both pairs of heels is:
     \[
     33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Relate the cost of the boots to the cost of the high heels:**
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Let \( B \) represent the cost of the boots. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     B = 99 + 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the boots:**
   - Now, we can solve for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 99 + 5 = 104 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \( \boxed{104} \) dollars.
