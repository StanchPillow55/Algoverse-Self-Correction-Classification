To solve the problem, we need to determine how many shells each team found and specifically how many shells the Gogetters found.

1. **Total shells discovered**: 
   The total number of shells discovered by the tourists is 700.

2. **Shells found by team Alphas**: 
   Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
   \]

3. **Remaining shells after Alphas**: 
   After team Alphas found their shells, we need to find out how many shells are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
   \]

4. **Shells found by team The finders**: 
   Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
   \]

5. **Remaining shells after The finders**: 
   Now we need to find out how many shells are left after both teams Alphas and The finders have taken their shares:
   \[
   \text{Remaining shells} = 420 - 252 = 168
   \]

6. **Shells found by team Gogetters**: 
   The remaining shells are the ones found by team Gogetters. Therefore, team Gogetters found:
   \[
   \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 168
   \]

Finally, we summarize our findings:
- Team Alphas found 280 shells.
- Team The finders found 252 shells.
- Team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Thus, the number of shells found by team Gogetters is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
