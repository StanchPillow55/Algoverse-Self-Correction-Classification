To solve the problem, we need to determine how many lemons Tim will need to make 4 gallons of lemonade plus an extra gallon that is twice as tart.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for 4 gallons of lemonade.

According to the recipe, Tim needs 1 cup of fresh lemon juice for each gallon of lemonade. Therefore, for 4 gallons, he will need:

\[
\text{Lemon juice for 4 gallons} = 4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of lemon juice needed for the extra gallon.

Allen wants an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart. To make it twice as tart, Tim will need to double the amount of lemon juice for that gallon. Since the regular recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice for 1 gallon, the tart lemonade will require:

\[
\text{Lemon juice for extra gallon} = 2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of lemon juice needed.

Now, we need to add the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons and the extra gallon:

\[
\text{Total lemon juice} = \text{Lemon juice for 4 gallons} + \text{Lemon juice for extra gallon}
\]
\[
\text{Total lemon juice} = 4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many lemons are needed to yield 6 cups of juice.

We know from the problem statement that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. To find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\text{Lemons needed} = 6 \text{ lemons/cup} \times 6 \text{ cups} = 36 \text{ lemons}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make 4 gallons of lemonade and an extra gallon that is twice as tart.

To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs:**
   - Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen wants 1 extra gallon, making the total:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} + 1 \text{ gallon} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - Therefore, for 5 gallons, Tim needs:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart gallon:**
   - The extra gallon that Allen wants is twice as tart. This means it will require double the amount of lemon juice compared to the regular gallons.
   - For the regular gallons (4 gallons), Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, totaling 4 cups.
   - For the extra tart gallon, he needs:
     \[
     2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Now, we add the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons and the extra tart gallon:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

5. **Determine how many lemons are needed:**
   - Tim found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, to find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups of juice, we calculate:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Thus, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make 5 gallons of lemonade, including the extra tart gallon for Allen.

**Final answer: 36 lemons**
