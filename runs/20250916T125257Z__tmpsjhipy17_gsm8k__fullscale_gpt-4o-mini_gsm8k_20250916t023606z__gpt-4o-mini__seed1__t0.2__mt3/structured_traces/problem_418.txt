To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the lockers based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the relationships**:
   - Let \( T \) represent the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches.
   - According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can express Zack's locker size \( Z \) as:
     \[
     Z = \frac{1}{2} T
     \]
   - Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker. Thus, we can express Peter's locker size \( P \) as:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} Z
     \]

2. **Substituting the expression for Zack's locker**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( Z \) into the equation for \( P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} \left( \frac{1}{2} T \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} T = \frac{1}{8} T
     \]

3. **Using the information about Peter's locker**:
   - We know from the problem that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches:
     \[
     P = 5
     \]
   - We can set this equal to our expression for \( P \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} T = 5
     \]

4. **Solving for Timothy's locker size \( T \)**:
   - To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
     \[
     T = 5 \times 8
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     T = 40
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is \( \boxed{40} \) cubic inches.
