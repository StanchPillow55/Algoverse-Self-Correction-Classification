To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the time period of collection**: Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old. We need to calculate how many months she collected shells until her 10th birthday.

2. **Calculate the age range**: Martha collects shells from age 5 to age 10. This means she collects shells for the entire duration of her 5th year to the end of her 9th year.

3. **Determine the number of years**: From age 5 to age 10 is a span of 5 years (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

4. **Convert years to months**: Since Martha collects one shell every month, we need to convert the number of years into months. There are 12 months in a year, so:
   \[
   \text{Total months} = 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of shells collected**: Since Martha collects one shell each month for 60 months, the total number of shells she has collected is:
   \[
   \text{Total shells} = 60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
   \]

Thus, by the time Martha turns 10 years old, she will have collected a total of **60 shells**.

Final answer: **60 shells**.
