To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the increase in weight**: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight and increases it by 50%. To find out how much 50% of 8 pounds is, we calculate:

   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 8 = \frac{50}{100} \times 8 = 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new weight after the increase**: Now, we add the increase (4 pounds) to the original weight (8 pounds):

   \[
   \text{New weight} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the weight he actually uses**: Jamaal finds the 12-pound weight too heavy, so he decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than 12 pounds. We calculate this by subtracting 2 pounds from 12 pounds:

   \[
   \text{Weight used} = 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The weight that Jamaal now uses is:

   \[
   \boxed{10} \text{ pounds}
   \]
