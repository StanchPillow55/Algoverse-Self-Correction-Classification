To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of tennis shoes sold each day and accounting for the returns.

1. **Sales on Friday:**
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Friday sales} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Sales on Saturday:**
   On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Saturday sales} = 2 \times \text{Friday sales} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sales on Sunday:**
   On Sunday, the store sold one-half the amount they did on Saturday.
   \[
   \text{Sunday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Saturday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Returns:**
   On Sunday, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. We need to subtract these returns from the total sales.
   \[
   \text{Returns} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   \]

5. **Total Sales Calculation:**
   Now, we will calculate the total number of shoes sold over the three days and then subtract the returns.
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Friday sales} + \text{Saturday sales} + \text{Sunday sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \text{ pairs}
   \]

6. **Final Calculation:**
   Now we will subtract the returns from the total sales to find the final number of shoes sold.
   \[
   \text{Final total} = \text{Total sales} - \text{Returns} = 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is \( \boxed{50} \).
