To determine how much profit Millie makes per hour from her lemonade stand, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.**
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - Millie makes 3 pitchers.
   - Total cups = Number of pitchers × Cups per pitcher
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade.**
   - Millie sells each cup for $1.
   - Total revenue = Total cups × Price per cup
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - Millie spends $18 on supplies.

4. **Calculate the total profit.**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how long Millie spends running the lemonade stand.**
   - Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - To find out how many hours she needs to sell all 36 cups, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per hour}} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour.**
   - Profit per hour = Total profit / Total hours
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

Finally, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is:

\[
\boxed{2 \text{ dollars/hour}}
\]

   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour.**
   - To find the profit per hour, divide the total profit by the total hours spent.
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Total hours}} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
