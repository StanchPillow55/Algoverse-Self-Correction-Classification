To find out how much change Carl receives after buying the cookies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.**
   - Carl buys 10 packs of cookies.
   - Each pack contains 6 cookies.
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cookies per pack} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the cookies.**
   - Each cookie costs $0.10.
   - The total cost for 60 cookies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cookies} \times \text{Cost per cookie} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much change Carl receives.**
   - Carl pays with a $10 bill.
   - To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The amount of change Carl receives is:
     \[
     \boxed{4.00}
     \] 

Thus, Carl receives $4.00 in change after purchasing the cookies.
