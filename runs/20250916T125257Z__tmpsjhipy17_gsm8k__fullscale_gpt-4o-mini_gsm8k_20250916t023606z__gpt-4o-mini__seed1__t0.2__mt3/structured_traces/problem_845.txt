To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math. We know the following:

1. There are a total of 20 students in the class.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

Let's denote:
- \( M \): the number of students good at math.
- \( E \): the number of students good at English.
- \( B \): the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information given, we can summarize:
- Students good at math only = 5
- Students good at English only = 8
- Students good at both subjects = \( B \)

The total number of students can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total students} = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at English only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
20 = 5 + 8 + B
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:
\[
20 = 13 + B
\]

To find \( B \), we subtract 13 from both sides:
\[
B = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Now we know that 7 students are good at both math and English.

Next, we can find the total number of students who are good at math. The students who are good at math include those who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects. Therefore, we can calculate \( M \) as follows:
\[
M = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
M = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of students who are good at math is \( 12 \).

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{The number of students good at math is } \boxed{12}.
