To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:**
   Walter bought a total of 60 apples. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
   \]

   To calculate this, we multiply:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]

   So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. **Calculate the number of apples remaining after he ate:**
   After eating 24 apples, we find the remaining apples:

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of apples Walter gave to his sister:**
   Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. We first need to calculate 25% of 36 apples.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   0.25 \times 36 = 9
   \]

   So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.

4. **Calculate the number of apples remaining after giving some to his sister:**
   Now we find out how many apples Walter has left after giving 9 apples to his sister:

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27
   \]

5. **Calculate the total money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:**
   Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. To find the total money received, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

   \[
   \text{Total money received} = 27 \times 3
   \]

   Performing the multiplication gives:

   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Thus, Walter received a total of **$81** from selling the remaining apples.

**Final Answer: $81**
