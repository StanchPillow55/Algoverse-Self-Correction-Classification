To solve the problem, we need to determine the temperature inside Carson's house during the night and then calculate how many logs he needs to burn to raise the temperature above the freezing point of 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Step 1: Determine the Night Temperature

We know that during the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. The problem states that it gets 33 degrees colder at night. 

To find the night temperature, we subtract 33 degrees from the daytime temperature:

\[
\text{Night Temperature} = \text{Day Temperature} - 33
\]
\[
\text{Night Temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 2: Determine How Much the Temperature Needs to Increase

Next, we need to find out how much Carson needs to raise the temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing. The freezing point is 32 degrees, and the current night temperature is 12 degrees. 

To find the required increase in temperature, we subtract the current temperature from the freezing point:

\[
\text{Temperature Increase Needed} = 32 - 12
\]
\[
\text{Temperature Increase Needed} = 20 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Logs Needed

Each log that Carson burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs he needs to burn to achieve the required temperature increase of 20 degrees, we divide the total increase needed by the increase per log:

\[
\text{Number of Logs} = \frac{\text{Temperature Increase Needed}}{\text{Increase per Log}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of Logs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Carson needs to burn **4 logs** to raise the temperature in his house above freezing and prevent the pipes from freezing.
