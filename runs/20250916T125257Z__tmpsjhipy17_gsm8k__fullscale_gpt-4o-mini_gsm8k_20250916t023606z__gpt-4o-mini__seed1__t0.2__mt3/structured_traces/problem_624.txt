To determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we will first calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total spent by the baseball coach.**

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at a price of $3 each. We can calculate the total cost for the baseballs as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost for baseballs} = \text{Number of baseballs} \times \text{Price per baseball}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for baseballs} = 9 \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for baseballs} = 27
\]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

**Step 2: Calculate the total spent by the basketball coach.**

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at a price of $14 each. We can calculate the total cost for the basketballs as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost for basketballs} = \text{Number of basketballs} \times \text{Price per basketball}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for basketballs} = 8 \times 14
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for basketballs} = 112
\]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in spending between the basketball coach and the baseball coach.**

Now we will find out how much more the basketball coach spent compared to the baseball coach:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total cost for basketballs} - \text{Total cost for baseballs}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 27
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 85
\]

Thus, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

**Final Answer:**
The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.
