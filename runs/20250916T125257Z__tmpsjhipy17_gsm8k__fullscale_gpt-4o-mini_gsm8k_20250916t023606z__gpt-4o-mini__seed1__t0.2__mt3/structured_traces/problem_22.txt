To determine how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we will break down the sales by each group of customers.

1. **First 3 customers**: Each of these customers buys 1 DVD.
   - Number of DVDs sold = Number of customers × DVDs per customer
   - Number of DVDs sold = 3 customers × 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

2. **Next 2 customers**: Each of these customers buys 2 DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold = Number of customers × DVDs per customer
   - Number of DVDs sold = 2 customers × 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs

3. **Last 3 customers**: These customers do not buy any DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold = 0 DVDs (since they bought none)

Now, we will sum the total number of DVDs sold from all groups:

- Total DVDs sold = DVDs sold by first 3 customers + DVDs sold by next 2 customers + DVDs sold by last 3 customers
- Total DVDs sold = 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs
- Total DVDs sold = 7 DVDs

Thus, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is **7 DVDs**. 

Final answer: **7 DVDs**.
