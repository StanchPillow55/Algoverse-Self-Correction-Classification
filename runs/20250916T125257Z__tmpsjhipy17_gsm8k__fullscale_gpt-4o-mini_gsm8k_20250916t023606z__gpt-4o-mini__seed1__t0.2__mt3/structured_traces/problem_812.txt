To find the total number of petals on the flowers that Rose puts in the vase, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower before any are dropped:**

   - **First type of flower:** Rose picks 3 flowers with 5 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from first type} = 3 \text{ flowers} \times 5 \text{ petals/flower} = 15 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Second type of flower:** Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from second type} = 4 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ petals/flower} = 24 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Third type of flower:** Rose picks 5 flowers with 4 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from third type} = 5 \text{ flowers} \times 4 \text{ petals/flower} = 20 \text{ petals}
     \]

   - **Fourth type of flower:** Rose picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.
     \[
     \text{Total petals from fourth type} = 6 \text{ flowers} \times 7 \text{ petals/flower} = 42 \text{ petals}
     \]

2. **Sum the total number of petals from all types of flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Total petals before dropping} = 15 + 24 + 20 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals before dropping} = 101 \text{ petals}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of flowers dropped:**
   Rose drops 1 flower from each type. Therefore, she drops:
   - 1 flower from the first type (5 petals)
   - 1 flower from the second type (6 petals)
   - 1 flower from the third type (4 petals)
   - 1 flower from the fourth type (7 petals)

   Now, we calculate the total number of petals lost due to the dropped flowers:
   \[
   \text{Total petals dropped} = 5 + 6 + 4 + 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals dropped} = 22 \text{ petals}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of petals in the vase after dropping the flowers:**
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = \text{Total petals before dropping} - \text{Total petals dropped}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = 101 - 22
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total petals in vase} = 79 \text{ petals}
   \]

Thus, the total number of petals in the vase is \( \boxed{79} \).
