To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 
   - This means each dog currently has one toy.

2. **Current Number of Dogs**:
   - James has 4 dogs and there are 8 more dogs added to the shelter.
   - Total dogs = 4 (current) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.

3. **Toys Needed for All Dogs**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs a total of 12 toys for 12 dogs.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.
   - Toys needed = Total dogs - Current toys = 12 - 4 = 8 toys.
   - So, James needs to buy 8 more toys.

5. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - After buying the toys, James goes back and sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Initially, there were 8 more dogs (the new dogs), so twice that amount is 2 * 8 = 16 more dogs.
   - Total dogs now = 4 (original) + 16 (new) = 20 dogs.

6. **Toys Needed After New Count**:
   - Now, James needs toys for 20 dogs.
   - Since he already has 4 toys, the number of toys he needs to buy now is:
   - Toys needed = Total dogs - Current toys = 20 - 4 = 16 toys.
   - So, James needs to buy 16 more toys.

7. **Dogs Leaving the Shelter**:
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now = 20 - 3 = 17 dogs.

8. **Final Calculation of Toys Needed**:
   - Now, James needs toys for 17 dogs.
   - Since he still has 4 toys, the number of toys he needs now is:
   - Toys needed = Total dogs - Current toys = 17 - 4 = 13 toys.

9. **Total Toys Needed**:
   - To summarize:
     - Initially, James needed 12 toys for 12 dogs.
     - After seeing the increase, he needed 16 toys for 20 dogs.
     - Finally, after 3 dogs left, he needs 13 toys for 17 dogs.

Thus, the final answer is that James needs a total of **13 toys** for the remaining dogs in the shelter.

To determine how many toys James needs for his doggie shelter, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog currently has one toy.
   - Total dogs initially = 4.

2. **Additional Dogs**:
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total dogs after adding the new ones = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.

3. **Toys Needed for 12 Dogs**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy**:
   - James currently has 4 toys and needs 12 toys.
   - Toys to buy = 12 (needed) - 4 (on hand) = 8 toys.

5. **Situation After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, so now he has 12 toys (4 on hand + 8 bought).

6. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - After buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Initially, there were 4 dogs, and he added 8 more, making it 12.
   - "Twice as many more dogs" means he needs to consider the number of dogs that were added (8) and double that.
   - Additional dogs = 8 (current additional) * 2 = 16 more dogs.
   - Total dogs now = 12 (current) + 16 (new) = 28 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed for 28 Dogs**:
   - James now needs 28 toys for 28 dogs.

8. **Toys James Needs to Buy Again**:
   - He has 12 toys now.
   - Toys to buy = 28 (needed) - 12 (on hand) = 16 toys.

9. **Situation After Some Dogs Leave**:
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now = 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

10. **Toys Needed for 25 Dogs**:
    - Now, James needs 25 toys for 25 dogs.

11. **Final Calculation of Toys Needed**:
    - He has 12 toys (after the first purchase) and then bought 16 more, so he has:
      - Total toys = 12 + 16 = 28 toys.
    - Since he now only needs 25 toys, he does not need to buy any more toys.

12. **Final Answer**:
    - James needs a total of 25 toys for the current number of dogs in the shelter.

Thus, the final answer is:
**James needs 25 toys in total.**

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the number of toys James needs at each stage.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - Therefore, he currently has enough toys for the dogs he has.

2. **New Dogs Arriving**:
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total number of dogs now = 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.

3. **Toys Needed for 12 Dogs**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.
   - Toys needed = Total dogs - Toys on hand = 12 - 4 = 8 toys.
   - So, James needs to buy 8 more toys.

5. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, so now he has 4 (original) + 8 (newly bought) = 12 toys.
   - He leaves the shelter with 12 toys.

6. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - When James left, he saw that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Initially, there were 8 new dogs added to the original 4, making it 12 dogs.
   - "Twice as many more dogs" means he needs to consider the number of new dogs added, which is 8.
   - Twice that amount = 2 * 8 = 16 additional dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now = 12 (original total) + 16 (new additional dogs) = 28 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed for 28 Dogs**:
   - Now, James needs 28 toys for 28 dogs.

8. **Toys James Has After Buying**:
   - James has 12 toys after his first purchase.

9. **Toys Needed to Buy Again**:
   - Toys needed = Total dogs - Toys on hand = 28 - 12 = 16 toys.
   - So, James needs to buy 16 more toys.

10. **Final Situation**:
    - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
    - Therefore, the new total number of dogs = 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

11. **Toys Needed for 25 Dogs**:
    - Now, James needs 25 toys for 25 dogs.

12. **Toys James Has**:
    - James still has the 12 toys he bought earlier (after the first purchase).

13. **Final Calculation of Toys Needed**:
    - Toys needed = Total dogs - Toys on hand = 25 - 12 = 13 toys.
    - So, James needs to buy 13 more toys.

### Final Answer:
James needs a total of **25 toys** for the 25 dogs currently in the shelter.
