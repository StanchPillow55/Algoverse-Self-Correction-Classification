Let \( s \) represent the number of strawberry cubes that Mary makes. According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( b \) is given by the equation:

\[
b = 5s - 4
\]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes (both strawberry and blueberry) is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
s + b = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( b \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
s + (5s - 4) = 116
\]

Next, we simplify the equation:

\[
s + 5s - 4 = 116
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
6s - 4 = 116
\]

Now, we will isolate \( s \) by first adding 4 to both sides:

\[
6s = 116 + 4
\]
\[
6s = 120
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( s \):

\[
s = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the equation for \( b \):

\[
b = 5s - 4
\]
\[
b = 5(20) - 4
\]
\[
b = 100 - 4
\]
\[
b = 96
\]

Thus, the number of blueberry cubes that Mary makes is 

\[
\boxed{96}
\]
