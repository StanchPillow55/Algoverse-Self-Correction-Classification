To determine the weight of the redwood tree after termites have eaten 30% of it, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of 10-foot sections in the 200-foot tall tree.**
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total height of the tree}}{\text{Height of each section}} = \frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the tree before termites.**
   Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of sections} \times \text{Weight per section} = 20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds/section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the weight of the wood eaten by termites.**
   Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we can calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten:
   \[
   \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 0.30 \times \text{Total weight} = 0.30 \times 8000 \text{ pounds} = 2400 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining weight of the tree after the termites have eaten part of it.**
   To find the remaining weight, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Weight eaten by termites} = 8000 \text{ pounds} - 2400 \text{ pounds} = 5600 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   The weight of the redwood tree after the termites have eaten 30% of it is:
   \[
   \boxed{5600 \text{ pounds}}
   \]
