To solve the problem, we need to determine how many extra arms and legs a person will grow after drinking Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum for fifteen days.

1. **Determine the growth of arms:**
   - The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days.
   - To find out how many arms are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the number of days it takes to grow one arm:
     \[
     \text{Number of arms} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{3 \text{ days/arm}} = 5 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Determine the growth of legs:**
   - The serum causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days.
   - To find out how many legs are grown in 15 days, we divide the total number of days by the number of days it takes to grow one leg:
     \[
     \text{Number of legs} = \frac{15 \text{ days}}{5 \text{ days/leg}} = 3 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of new limbs:**
   - Each arm and leg counts as a limb. Therefore, we add the number of arms and legs together to find the total number of new limbs:
     \[
     \text{Total limbs} = \text{Number of arms} + \text{Number of legs} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ limbs}
     \]

Thus, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs.

**Final Answer: 8 limbs**
