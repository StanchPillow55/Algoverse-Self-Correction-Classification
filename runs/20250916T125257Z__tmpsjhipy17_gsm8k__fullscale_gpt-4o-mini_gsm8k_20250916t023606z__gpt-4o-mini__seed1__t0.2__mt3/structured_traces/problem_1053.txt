To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we will break down the costs of each item she purchased step by step.

1. **Cost of the tank top**: 
   - Alison bought a tank top for $10.
   - Cost of tank top = $10.

2. **Cost of the running shorts**: 
   - The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.
   - Cost of running shorts = Cost of tank top + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15.

3. **Cost of the tennis shoes**: 
   - The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price.
   - Sale price of tennis shoes = Original price / 2 = $48 / 2 = $24.

4. **Cost of the athletic socks**: 
   - The package of athletic socks costs $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off.
   - Cost of athletic socks after coupon = Original price - Coupon = $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we will sum up all the costs to find the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear:

- Total cost = Cost of tank top + Cost of running shorts + Cost of tennis shoes + Cost of athletic socks
- Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Now, let's calculate the total:

\[
10 + 15 = 25
\]
\[
25 + 24 = 49
\]
\[
49 + 6 = 55
\]

Thus, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is **$55**.

**Final Answer**: Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.
