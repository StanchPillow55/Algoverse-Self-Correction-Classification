To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, given that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. 

Letâ€™s denote the temperature of the second mug as \( T \) degrees.

### Step 1: Understand the Mixing of Water
When Donny pours 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle is:
\[
4 \text{ ounces} + 1 \text{ ounce} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Heat Energy
The heat energy contributed by each mug can be calculated using the formula for the total heat energy of a mixture, which is based on the principle of conservation of energy. The total heat energy \( Q \) of the mixture can be expressed as:
\[
Q = (m_1 \cdot T_1) + (m_2 \cdot T_2)
\]
where:
- \( m_1 \) is the mass (or volume, since we are dealing with water) of the first mug,
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature of the first mug,
- \( m_2 \) is the mass (or volume) of the second mug,
- \( T_2 \) is the temperature of the second mug.

In our case:
- \( m_1 = 4 \) ounces,
- \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees,
- \( m_2 = 1 \) ounce,
- \( T_2 = T \) degrees.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
The average temperature \( T_{avg} \) of the mixture can be calculated as:
\[
T_{avg} = \frac{Q}{m_1 + m_2} = \frac{(4 \cdot 33) + (1 \cdot T)}{4 + 1}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
T_{avg} = \frac{132 + T}{5}
\]

### Step 4: Set the Average Temperature to 40 Degrees
Since Donny can only drink the water if the average temperature is at least 40 degrees, we set up the inequality:
\[
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
\]

### Step 5: Solve the Inequality
To solve for \( T \), we first multiply both sides by 5:
\[
132 + T \geq 200
\]
Next, we subtract 132 from both sides:
\[
T \geq 200 - 132
\]
\[
T \geq 68
\]

### Conclusion
The minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
