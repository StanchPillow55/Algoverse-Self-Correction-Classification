To solve the problem, we first need to determine the mowing rates for both modes of the lawn mower.

1. **Determine the mowing rates:**
   - In "turtle" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, his rate in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

   - In "rabbit" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Thus, his rate in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

2. **Determine the time taken for each mode:**
   - Chris mows half of the lawn in turtle mode and half in rabbit mode. Therefore, he mows \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the lawn in each mode.

3. **Calculate the time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode:**
   - The time taken to mow \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the lawn in turtle mode can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - For half the lawn:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1/2}{1/60} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode:**
   - Similarly, for half the lawn in rabbit mode:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1/2}{1/40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time taken:**
   - The total time taken to mow the entire lawn is the sum of the time taken in both modes:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} + \text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is \( \boxed{50} \) minutes.
