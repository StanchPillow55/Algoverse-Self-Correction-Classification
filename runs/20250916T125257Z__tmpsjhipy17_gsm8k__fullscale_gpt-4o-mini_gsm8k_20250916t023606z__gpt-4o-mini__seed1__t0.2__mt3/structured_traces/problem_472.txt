To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the number of cookies Matt wants to eat and the number of carrot sticks he needs to eat.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
   - According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The number of cookies Matt can have is given by the expression:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2
     \]
   - We know that Matt wants to eat a total of 5 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5
     \]

3. **Solve for \( c \)**:
   - First, we will isolate \( \frac{c}{2} \) by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 5 - 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Next, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 3 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     c = 6
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Matt needs to eat **6 carrot sticks** in order to have a total of 5 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
