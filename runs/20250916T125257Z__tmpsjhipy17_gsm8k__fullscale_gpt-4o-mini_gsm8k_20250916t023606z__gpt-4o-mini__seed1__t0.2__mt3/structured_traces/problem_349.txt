To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate her monthly expenses and then multiply that by the number of months in a year.

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of dog food:**
   - The cost of food is $25 per week.
   - Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is:
     \[
     \text{Monthly food cost} = 25 \text{ (dollars/week)} \times 4 \text{ (weeks/month)} = 100 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the monthly cost of treats:**
   - The cost of treats is given as $20 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is:
     \[
     \text{Monthly treats cost} = 20 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the monthly cost of medicine:**
   - The cost of medicine is given as $100 per month.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost of medicine is:
     \[
     \text{Monthly medicine cost} = 100 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total monthly expenses:**
   - Now, we can sum up all the monthly expenses:
     \[
     \text{Total monthly expenses} = \text{Monthly food cost} + \text{Monthly treats cost} + \text{Monthly medicine cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total monthly expenses} = 100 + 20 + 100 = 220 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

5. **Calculate the annual expenses:**
   - To find the total expenses for the year, we multiply the total monthly expenses by the number of months in a year (12):
     \[
     \text{Total annual expenses} = \text{Total monthly expenses} \times 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total annual expenses} = 220 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 2640 \text{ dollars/year}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Madeline spends on her dog per year is \(\boxed{2640}\) dollars.
