To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched.**
   Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.

2. **Determine the amount of fertiliser each truck was carrying.**
   Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

3. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser dispatched.**
   We can calculate the total amount of fertiliser by multiplying the number of trucks by the amount of fertiliser each truck carries:
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = \text{Number of trucks} \times \text{Fertiliser per truck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures.**
   According to the problem, a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total trucks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.**
   To find the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser, we subtract the number of trucks with mechanical failures from the total number of trucks:
   \[
   \text{Successful trucks} = \text{Total trucks} - \text{Trucks with failures}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.**
   Now, we can calculate the total amount of fertiliser delivered by the successful trucks:
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = \text{Successful trucks} \times \text{Fertiliser per truck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Finally, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:
\[
\boxed{300 \text{ tons}}
\]
