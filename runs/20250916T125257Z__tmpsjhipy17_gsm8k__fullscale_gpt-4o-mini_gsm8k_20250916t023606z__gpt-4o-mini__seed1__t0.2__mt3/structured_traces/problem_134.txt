To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the monthly cost of car washes**:
   Tom gets 4 car washes a month, and each car wash costs $15. 
   We can calculate the monthly cost by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per wash:

   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = \text{Number of Car Washes} \times \text{Cost per Car Wash}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = 4 \times 15 = 60
   \]

   So, Tom pays $60 each month for car washes.

2. **Calculate the annual cost of car washes**:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the total annual cost by multiplying the monthly cost by the number of months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Monthly Cost} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 60 \times 12 = 720
   \]

Thus, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

3. **Final Answer**:
   Tom pays **$720** in a year for car washes.
