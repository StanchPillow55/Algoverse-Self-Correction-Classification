To solve the problem, we start by determining how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: Carla has 8 octuplets.

2. **Dressing in purple**: 
   - Carla dresses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets in purple.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 octuplets are dressed in purple.

3. **Dressing in blue**: 
   - The remaining octuplets are dressed in blue.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     8 - 6 = 2
     \]
   - So, 2 octuplets are dressed in blue.

4. **Bows worn by blue-wearers**: 
   - All the blue-wearers wear bows.
   - Therefore, the number of blue-wearers wearing bows is:
     \[
     2
     \]

5. **Bows worn by purple-wearers**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]
   - So, 2 purple-wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Total number of babies wearing bows**: 
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers wearing bows.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

7. **Percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**: 
   - We need to find the proportion of babies wearing bows that are purple-wearers.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To convert this to a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \).

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of octuplets**: 
   Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2. **Calculate how many are dressed in purple and blue**:
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in purple. 
   - To find the number of octuplets in purple:
     \[
     \text{Number in purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - The remaining octuplets are dressed in blue. Since there are 8 octuplets in total:
     \[
     \text{Number in blue} = 8 - 6 = 2
     \]

3. **Determine how many wear bows**:
   - The problem states that all the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 2 blue-wearers:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-wearers with bows} = 2
     \]
   - It also states that \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows. Since there are 6 purple-wearers:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple-wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue-wearers with bows and purple-wearers with bows:
     \[
     \text{Total wearing bows} = 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

5. **Determine the number of babies wearing purple that are also wearing bows**:
   - From the previous calculation, we found that 2 purple-wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     P(\text{purple} | \text{wearing bow}) = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To express this as a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that there is a **50% chance** that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.

To solve the problem, we start by determining how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing in purple**:
   - Carla dresses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets in purple.
   - Number of purple-wearers: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]

3. **Dressing in blue**:
   - The remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in blue.
   - Number of blue-wearers: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
     \]

Now we know:
- Purple-wearers: 6
- Blue-wearers: 2

4. **Bows**:
   - All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 blue-wearers.
   - 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ purple-wearers}
     \]

5. **Total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - Total wearing bows = blue-wearers + purple-wearers wearing bows:
     \[
     2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

6. **Calculating the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The number of babies wearing bows that are purple is 2.
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.
   - The probability (or percentage chance) that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To express this as a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50\%}
