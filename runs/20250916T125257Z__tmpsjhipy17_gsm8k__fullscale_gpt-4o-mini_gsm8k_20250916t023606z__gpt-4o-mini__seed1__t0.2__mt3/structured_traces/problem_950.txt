Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we have three equations:

1. \( B + A + D = 45 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( B = A + 20 \) (Equation 2)
3. \( B = D + 10 \) (Equation 3)

Next, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from Equations 2 and 3 into Equation 1.

First, substitute \( B \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

Next, substitute \( B \) from Equation 3 into Equation 1:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we have two new equations (Equation 4 and Equation 5):
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 4)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 5)

We can solve these two equations simultaneously. From Equation 4, we can express \( D \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A \quad \text{(Equation 6)}
\]

Now substitute Equation 6 into Equation 5:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 results in:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using Equation 6:
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using Equation 2:
\[
B = A + 20 = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

Now we have all the scores:
- Bahati (B) = 25
- Azibo (A) = 5
- Dinar (D) = 15

To verify, we check the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) back into the total points equation:

\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Now, add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Dividing both sides by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):

Using \( A = B - 20 \):
\[
A = 25 - 20 = 5
\]

Using \( D = B - 10 \):
\[
D = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Now we have:
- Bahati scored \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

To verify, we check the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}

Now we can check our work by verifying the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
