To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights after they have both grown, we need to first determine their new heights after growth.

1. **Calculate Xavier's new height:**
   - Xavier's original height was 4 feet.
   - He grew 3 inches over the summer.

   First, we need to convert Xavier's height from feet to inches because his growth is measured in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

   \[
   \text{Xavier's height in inches} = 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches}
   \]

   Now, we add the growth to his height:

   \[
   \text{Xavier's new height} = 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate Cole's new height:**
   - Cole's original height was 50 inches.
   - He grew 2 inches over the summer.

   We add the growth to Cole's height:

   \[
   \text{Cole's new height} = 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:**
   - Now we need to find the difference between Cole's new height and Xavier's new height:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Cole's new height} - \text{Xavier's new height} = 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
   \]

Thus, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:

\[
\boxed{1 \text{ inch}}
\]
