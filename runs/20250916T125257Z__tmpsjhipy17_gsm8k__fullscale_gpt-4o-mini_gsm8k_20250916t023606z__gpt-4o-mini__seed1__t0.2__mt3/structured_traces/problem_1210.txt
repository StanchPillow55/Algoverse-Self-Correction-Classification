To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons filled.**
   Jolene filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = 10 \times 30 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine how many balloons were left at the end.**
   According to the problem, there were 12 balloons left after the water balloon fight.

3. **Calculate the number of balloons thrown.**
   To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons filled:

   \[
   \text{Balloons thrown} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Balloons left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Balloons thrown} = 300 - 12 = 288
   \]

Thus, the total number of balloons that were thrown during the water balloon fight is:

\[
\boxed{288}
\]
