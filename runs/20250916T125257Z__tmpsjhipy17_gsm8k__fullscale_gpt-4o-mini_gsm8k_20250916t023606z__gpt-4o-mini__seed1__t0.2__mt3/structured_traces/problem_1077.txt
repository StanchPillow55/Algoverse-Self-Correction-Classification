To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to analyze the schedule of the trains step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Arrival time: 10 minutes
   - Duration at the station: 20 minutes
   - Departure time: \(10 + 20 = 30\) minutes

2. **Second Train:**
   - Arrival time: Half an hour after the first train leaves.
   - The first train leaves at 30 minutes, so the second train arrives at \(30 + 30 = 60\) minutes.
   - Duration at the station: A quarter of the first train's duration.
   - The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train stays for \(20 / 4 = 5\) minutes.
   - Departure time: \(60 + 5 = 65\) minutes

3. **Third Train:**
   - Arrival time: An hour after the second train leaves.
   - The second train leaves at 65 minutes, so the third train arrives at \(65 + 60 = 125\) minutes.
   - Duration at the station: The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it stays for 0 minutes.
   - Departure time: 125 minutes (it leaves immediately).

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Arrival time: 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - The third train leaves at 125 minutes, so the fourth train arrives at \(125 + 20 = 145\) minutes.

Now, we need to calculate how long Paul waits for the fourth train. Since he arrives at the station at the same time as the first train (0 minutes), we can calculate his total waiting time until the fourth train arrives.

- **Waiting time until the fourth train arrives:**
  - Fourth train arrival time: 145 minutes
  - Paul's arrival time: 0 minutes
  - Total waiting time: \(145 - 0 = 145\) minutes

Thus, Paul will wait for a total of **145 minutes** for his train.

Final answer: **145 minutes**.
