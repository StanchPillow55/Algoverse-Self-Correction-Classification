To determine how many calories John consumed from drinking 2 glasses of milk, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk John drank**:
   - Each glass of milk contains 8 ounces.
   - John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
   - Therefore, the total amount of milk John drank is:
     \[
     \text{Total ounces} = \text{Ounces per glass} \times \text{Number of glasses} = 8 \, \text{ounces/glass} \times 2 \, \text{glasses} = 16 \, \text{ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total calories consumed**:
   - We know that milk has 3 calories per ounce.
   - To find the total calories in the 16 ounces of milk, we multiply the total ounces by the calories per ounce:
     \[
     \text{Total calories} = \text{Total ounces} \times \text{Calories per ounce} = 16 \, \text{ounces} \times 3 \, \text{calories/ounce} = 48 \, \text{calories}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - John consumed a total of 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
