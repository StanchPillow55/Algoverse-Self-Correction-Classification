To determine how many groups can perform in Vicki's concert, we first need to calculate the total time allocated for each group, including the time for getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. We also need to account for the intermission.

1. **Calculate the total time for one group:**
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Time to perform: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

   Total time for one group = Time to get on stage + Time to perform + Time to exit the stage
   \[
   \text{Total time for one group} = 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Include the intermission:**
   Vicki is allowing a 10-minute intermission. This intermission will occur after a certain number of groups have performed.

3. **Determine the total concert duration:**
   The concert is planned to last for 2 hours. We need to convert this into minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \( n \) be the number of groups that perform. The total time used for \( n \) groups plus the intermission must equal the total concert duration:
   \[
   10n + 10 = 120
   \]
   Here, \( 10n \) is the total time for \( n \) groups, and \( 10 \) is the time for the intermission.

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   First, subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
   \[
   10n = 120 - 10
   \]
   \[
   10n = 110
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 10 to find \( n \):
   \[
   n = \frac{110}{10} = 11
   \]

Thus, the maximum number of groups that can perform in the concert is \( \boxed{11} \).
