To determine the cost per individual razor after applying the discounts and promotions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the razors without any discounts**:
   - Each pack of razors costs $4.00 and contains 4 razors.
   - If Heather buys 2 packs, the total cost without any discounts is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost without discounts} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Apply the buy one get one free offer**:
   - Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will only pay for 1 pack due to the buy one get one free offer.
   - Therefore, the cost after applying this offer is:
     \[
     \text{Cost after BOGO} = 4.00 \text{ dollars} \text{ (cost of 1 pack)}
     \]

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon**:
   - Heather has a $2.00 coupon that can be applied to her total cost after the BOGO offer.
   - Thus, the cost after applying the coupon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost after coupon} = 4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of razors**:
   - Since Heather bought 2 packs and each pack contains 4 razors, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     \text{Total razors} = 2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Calculate the cost per individual razor**:
   - Now, we need to find the cost per razor after all discounts. The total cost after applying the coupon is $2.00.
   - Therefore, the cost per razor is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{\text{Total cost after coupon}}{\text{Total razors}} = \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents**:
   - Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we convert the cost per razor to cents:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars/razor} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents/razor}
     \]

Finally, the cost of each individual razor after the discounts is:

\[
\boxed{25} \text{ cents}
\]
