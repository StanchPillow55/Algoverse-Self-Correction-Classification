To solve the problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We will start by defining the capacities of each truck based on the information provided.

1. **Gissela's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
   \[
   G_{\text{Gissela}} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Gordy's Truck Capacity**: 
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gordy}} = G_{\text{Gissela}} + 800 = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combined Capacity of All Trucks**: 
   We know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total capacity of all three trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gissela}} + G_{\text{Gordy}} + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]

   Substituting the known values for Gissela's and Gordy's truck capacities:
   \[
   4000 + 4800 + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]

4. **Calculating Gary's Truck Capacity**: 
   Now we can simplify the equation to find Gary's truck capacity:
   \[
   8800 + G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600
   \]
   To isolate \( G_{\text{Gary}} \), we subtract 8800 from both sides:
   \[
   G_{\text{Gary}} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   G_{\text{Gary}} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the capacity of Gary's truck is **2,800 pounds**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{2800}
\]

To solve the problem, we will first determine the hauling capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, and then use that information to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

1. **Determine Gissela's truck capacity:**
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

   \[
   \text{Gissela's truck capacity} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity:**
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:**
   Now we can find the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks:

   \[
   \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine Gary's truck capacity:**
   We know that the total capacity of all three trucks (Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's) is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Combined capacity of Gissela and Gordy} + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   11600 = 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]

   To find Gary's truck capacity, we can rearrange the equation:

   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the capacity of Gary's truck is:

   \[
   \boxed{2800} \text{ pounds}
   \]
