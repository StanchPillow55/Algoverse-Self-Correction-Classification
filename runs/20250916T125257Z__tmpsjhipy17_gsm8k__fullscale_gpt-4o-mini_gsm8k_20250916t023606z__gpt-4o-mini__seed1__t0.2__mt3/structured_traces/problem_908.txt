To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some away.

1. **Initial Count of Marbles**: 
   Dean starts with 30 marbles.

2. **Calculating the Marbles Given to Jamie**:
   Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his marbles to Jamie. To find out how many marbles this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
   \]
   So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

3. **Calculating the Marbles Given to Donald**:
   Dean also gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

4. **Total Marbles Given Away**:
   Now we need to find the total number of marbles Dean has given away. This is the sum of the marbles given to Jamie and Donald:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles given away} = \text{Marbles to Jamie} + \text{Marbles to Donald}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles given away} = 6 + 10 = 16
   \]

5. **Calculating the Remaining Marbles**:
   To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the initial count of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Marbles left} = \text{Initial marbles} - \text{Total marbles given away}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Marbles left} = 30 - 16 = 14
   \]

Thus, after giving away the marbles, Dean has **14 marbles left**.

**Final Answer**: Dean has 14 marbles left.
