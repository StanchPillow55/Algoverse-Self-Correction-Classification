To determine who wins the race and how long the winner will be waiting for the loser, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to get home from school.

### Step 1: Convert distances from miles to feet
1 mile = 5280 feet.

- **Steve's distance**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ miles} = 3 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 15840 \text{ feet}
  \]

- **Tim's distance**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ miles} = 2 \times 5280 \text{ feet} = 10560 \text{ feet}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken for each person to get home
Time is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

- **Steve's time**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet per minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- **Tim's time**:
  \[
  \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet per minute}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the winner and the waiting time
Now we compare the times:
- Steve takes 36 minutes.
- Tim takes 40 minutes.

Since Steve takes less time, he is the winner.

### Step 4: Calculate how long the winner waits
To find out how long Steve will be waiting for Tim, we subtract Steve's time from Tim's time:
\[
\text{Waiting time} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Steve will be waiting for Tim for **4 minutes** before Tim finishes the race.
