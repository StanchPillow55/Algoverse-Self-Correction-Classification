To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of onions needed**: 
   - The original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.
   - Antoine likes to double that amount, so:
     \[
     \text{Total onions needed} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the onions**:
   - The price of onions is $2.00 per pound.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the onions is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of onions} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the amount of beef stock needed**:
   - Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock.

4. **Calculate the cost of the beef stock**:
   - The price of beef stock is $2.00 per box.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the beef stock is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of beef stock} = 2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the ingredients**:
   - Now we add the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of onions} + \text{Cost of beef stock} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Determine the number of servings**:
   - The soup serves 6 people.

7. **Calculate the cost per serving**:
   - To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:
     \[
     \text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ servings}} = 2 \text{ dollars/serving}
     \]

8. **Round to the nearest integer**:
   - The cost per serving is already an integer, so no rounding is necessary.

Finally, the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is:
\[
\boxed{2} \text{ dollars}
\]
