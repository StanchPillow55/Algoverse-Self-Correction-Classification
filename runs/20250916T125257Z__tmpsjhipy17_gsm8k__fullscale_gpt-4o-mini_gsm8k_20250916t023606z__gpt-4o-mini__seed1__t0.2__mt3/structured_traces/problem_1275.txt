To determine the force needed to push John's car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. Then, we will find 1% of that total weight, as the problem states that the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight

1. **Weight of the car**: 1200 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 250 pounds
3. **Weight of the two children**: 
   - Each child weighs 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of the children = 75 pounds + 75 pounds = 150 pounds

Now, we can sum these weights to find the total weight:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the children}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate 1% of the total weight

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight to determine the force required to push the car.

\[
\text{Force} = 1\% \text{ of Total weight}
\]

To calculate 1%, we can multiply the total weight by 0.01:

\[
\text{Force} = 0.01 \times 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Force} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the force needed to push the car is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ pounds}}
\]
