To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish he initially has is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys 17 fish from the pet store. We need to determine how many of these are orange and how many are white.

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob has:
     \[
     7 \text{ (initial fish)} + 17 \text{ (new fish)} = 24 \text{ fish}
     \]

4. **Condition Given**:
   - After adding the new fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Letâ€™s denote:
     - The number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \).
     - The number of orange fish Bob bought as \( o \).

   Since he bought a total of 17 fish, we have:
   \[
   o + w = 17
   \]

5. **Final Counts of Fish**:
   - After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is:
     \[
     3 + o
     \]
   - The total number of white fish is:
     \[
     4 + w
     \]

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + o = 2(4 + w)
   \]

7. **Expanding and Rearranging the Equation**:
   - Expanding the right side:
   \[
   3 + o = 8 + 2w
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   o - 2w = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

8. **Substituting for \( o \)**:
   - From the total fish equation \( o + w = 17 \), we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):
   \[
   o = 17 - w \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

9. **Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1**:
   - Substitute \( o \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
   \[
   (17 - w) - 2w = 5
   \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3w = 5
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   -3w = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3w = -12
   \]
   \[
   w = 4
   \]

10. **Finding \( o \)**:
    - Now substituting \( w = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( o \):
    \[
    o = 17 - 4 = 13
    \]

11. **Final Counts**:
    - Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish.

12. **Conclusion**:
    - The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
    \[
    \boxed{4}
    \]

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 7 fish in total: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We need to find out how many of these are white and how many are orange.

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

4. **Setting Up Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought from the store.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of white fish Bob bought from the store.

   From the problem, we know:
   \[
   x + y = 17 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

5. **Final Counts of Fish**:
   - After adding the fish from the store, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + x \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + y \).

   According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + x = 2(4 + y) \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

6. **Expanding Equation (2)**:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(3)}
   \]

7. **Solving the System of Equations**:
   We now have two equations:
   - Equation (1): \( x + y = 17 \)
   - Equation (3): \( x - 2y = 5 \)

   We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation (1), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y \quad \text{(4)}
   \]

   Now, substitute Equation (4) into Equation (3):
   \[
   (17 - y) - 2y = 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]

8. **Finding \( x \)**:
   Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using Equation (4):
   \[
   x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
   \]

9. **Conclusion**:
   Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish from the store.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

   - Therefore, the total number of fish Bob initially has is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Pet Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We will denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).
   - From the problem, we know:
     \[
     x + y = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the pet store to his pond, Bob has:
     - Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
     - White fish: \( 4 + y \)

4. **Condition Given**:
   - The problem states that after adding the fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 2(4 + y)
     \]

5. **Expanding the Condition**:
   - Let's expand the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 8 + 2y
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives:
     \[
     x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

6. **System of Equations**:
   - Now we have a system of two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 17 \) (Equation 2)
     2. \( x - 2y = 5 \) (Equation 1)

7. **Solving the System**:
   - We can solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using Equation 2:
     \[
     x = 17 - y
     \]
   - Substitute \( x \) into Equation 1:
     \[
     (17 - y) - 2y = 5
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     17 - 3y = 5
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for \( y \):
     \[
     17 - 5 = 3y \\
     12 = 3y \\
     y = 4
     \]

8. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - Now substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x + 4 = 17 \\
     x = 17 - 4 \\
     x = 13
     \]

9. **Final Counts**:
   - Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish.

10. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]
