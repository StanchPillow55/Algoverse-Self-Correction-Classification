To solve the problem, we need to determine how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat based on the information provided about large and medium-sized jelly beans.

1. **Determine the number of medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat:**
   - We know that Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.
   - According to the problem, he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.
   - Therefore, the number of medium-sized beans he can eat is:
     \[
     \text{Medium-sized beans} = 2 \times \text{Large beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
     \]

2. **Determine the number of small beans equivalent to medium-sized beans:**
   - The problem states that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean.
   - To find out how many small beans are equivalent to the 150 medium-sized beans, we can set up a conversion:
     \[
     \text{Small beans} = 3 \times \text{Medium-sized beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450
     \]

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of small jelly beans Grandpa can eat is 450.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{450}
\]
