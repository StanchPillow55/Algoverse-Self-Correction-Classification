To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the savings account**: 
   Katina starts with $3000.

2. **Determine how much she withdraws each month**: 
   Katina withdraws $100 every month.

3. **Calculate the total number of months in 2 years**: 
   Since there are 12 months in a year, in 2 years there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount withdrawn over 2 years**: 
   If she withdraws $100 each month for 24 months, the total amount withdrawn is:
   \[
   100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining balance in the savings account**: 
   To find out how much money will be left in the account after 2 years, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
   \[
   3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after 2 years, the amount remaining in Katina's savings account will be:

\[
\boxed{600} \text{ dollars}
\]
