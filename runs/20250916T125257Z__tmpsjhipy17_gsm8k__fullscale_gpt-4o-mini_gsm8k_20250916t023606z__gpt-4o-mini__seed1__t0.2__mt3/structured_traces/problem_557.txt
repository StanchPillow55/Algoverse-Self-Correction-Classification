To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag.

1. **Identify the total number of buttons**: 
   The problem states that there are 21 buttons in total.

2. **Determine the number of buttons with two holes**: 
   We know that 7 buttons have two holes.

3. **Calculate the number of buttons with four holes**: 
   To find out how many buttons have four holes, we subtract the number of buttons with two holes from the total number of buttons:
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = \text{Total buttons} - \text{Buttons with two holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of buttons with four holes} = 21 - 7 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with two holes**: 
   Each of the 7 buttons with two holes contributes 2 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   \text{Holes from buttons with two holes} = 7 \times 2 = 14
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of holes from the buttons with four holes**: 
   Each of the 14 buttons with four holes contributes 4 holes. Therefore, the total number of holes from these buttons is:
   \[
   \text{Holes from buttons with four holes} = 14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of holes in all buttons**: 
   Now, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons:
   \[
   \text{Total holes} = \text{Holes from buttons with two holes} + \text{Holes from buttons with four holes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total holes} = 14 + 56 = 70
   \]

Thus, the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \( \boxed{70} \).
