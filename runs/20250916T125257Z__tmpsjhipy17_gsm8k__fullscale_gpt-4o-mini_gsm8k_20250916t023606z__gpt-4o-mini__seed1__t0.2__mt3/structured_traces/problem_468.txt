To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Number of Shoes**: Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Gains on Monday**: On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we calculate the total number of shoes he gains on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Monday} = 5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Now, we add this to his initial number of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Monday} = 200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Gains on Wednesday**: On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, we calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Wednesday} = 15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total number of shoes after Monday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Wednesday} = 210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Gains on Friday**: On Friday, he gains 30 pairs of shoes. We calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Friday} = 30 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   We add this to the total number of shoes after Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Friday} = 240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Loss on Saturday**: On Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. We subtract this from the total number of shoes after Friday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Saturday} = 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

6. **Final Count on Sunday**: After all the transactions, the total number of shoes Fireman Frank has on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes on Sunday} = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
