To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles, given that it travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at a speed of 60 miles/hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[
\text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the car in the slow lane to cover 480 miles.

To find the time taken to cover a certain distance, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

In this case, the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles/hour. Plugging in these values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation.

Now we perform the division:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ hours}}
\]
