To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Dora's Age:**
   - We know from the problem that Dora is 15 years old.
   \[
   \text{Dora's age} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate Dora's Father's Age:**
   - The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
   \]
   - Substituting Dora's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Calculate Dora's Mother's Age:**
   - The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
   \]
   - Substituting the father's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 34
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Combined Age:**
   - Now we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age}
   \]
   - Substituting the ages we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 + 34
   \]
   - Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 = 53
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 53 + 34 = 87
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
   \[
   \boxed{87}
   \]
