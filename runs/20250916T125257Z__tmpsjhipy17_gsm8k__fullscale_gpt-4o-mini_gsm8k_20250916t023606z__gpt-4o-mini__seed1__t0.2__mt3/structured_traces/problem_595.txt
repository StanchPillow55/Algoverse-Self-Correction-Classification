To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the statement**: The problem states that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. We need to express this mathematically.

2. **Let \( x \) be Jerry's current age**. According to the problem, Jerry's age 5 years ago would be \( x - 5 \).

3. **Setting up the equation**: The problem states that Jerry's current age \( x \) is twice his age 5 years ago. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x = 2(x - 5)
   \]

4. **Expanding the equation**: Now, let's expand the right side of the equation:
   \[
   x = 2x - 10
   \]

5. **Rearranging the equation**: To isolate \( x \), we can subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   x - 2x = -10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -x = -10
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**: Now, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

7. **Finding Jerry's current age**: We have determined that Jerry is currently 10 years old.

8. **Calculating Jerry's age in 3 years**: To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:
   \[
   10 + 3 = 13
   \]

9. **Final answer**: Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
