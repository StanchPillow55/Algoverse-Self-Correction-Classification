To determine Kim's weekly profit from his housekeeping business, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of clients**: 
   - Kim currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 potential clients. 
   - Therefore, the total number of clients is:
     \[
     3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies**:
   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of each pack of cloths is $5.

   First, calculate the total number of bottles of bleach needed:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles of bleach} = 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} = 16 \text{ bottles}
   \]

   Next, calculate the total cost for the bottles of bleach:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bleach} = 16 \text{ bottles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total number of packs of cloths needed:
   \[
   \text{Total packs of cloths} = 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} = 8 \text{ packs}
   \]

   Then, calculate the total cost for the packs of cloths:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cloths} = 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total expenses by adding the costs of bleach and cloths:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of bleach} + \text{Cost of cloths} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit is defined as the difference between total income and total expenses.
   - Kim's total income each week is $92.

   Therefore, the profit can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total expenses} = 92 \text{ dollars} - 72 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.

To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine both his total income and total expenses.

1. **Determine the total number of clients:**
   - Kim currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 potential clients.
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires:
     - 2 bottles of bleach
     - 1 pack of cloths
   - Cost of supplies:
     - Cost of 1 bottle of bleach = $2
     - Cost of 1 pack of cloths = $5

   - Total cost for supplies per client:
     \[
     \text{Cost per client} = (2 \text{ bottles} \times 2 \text{ dollars}) + (1 \text{ pack} \times 5 \text{ dollars}) = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total expenses for all clients:
     \[
     \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost per client} \times \text{Total clients} = 9 \text{ dollars} \times 8 = 72 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine total income:**
   - Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

4. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total expenses}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 92 \text{ dollars} - 72 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.

To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate his total expenses and then subtract these from his total income.

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Kim has 3 existing clients and is considering 5 potential clients.
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires:
     - 2 bottles of bleach
     - 1 pack of cloths
   - Cost of supplies:
     - Cost of bleach: $2 per bottle
     - Cost of cloths: $5 per pack

3. **Calculate the total cost for each client:**
   - Cost for bleach per client = 2 bottles × $2/bottle = $4
   - Cost for cloths per client = 1 pack × $5/pack = $5
   - Total cost per client = Cost for bleach + Cost for cloths
   - Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

4. **Calculate total expenses for all clients:**
   - Total expenses = Total cost per client × Total number of clients
   - Total expenses = $9/client × 8 clients = $72

5. **Calculate total income:**
   - Kim's total income each week = $92

6. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses
   - Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.
