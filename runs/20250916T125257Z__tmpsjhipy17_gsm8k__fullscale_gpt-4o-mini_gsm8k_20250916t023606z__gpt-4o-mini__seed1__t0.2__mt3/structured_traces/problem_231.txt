To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many shells Robert collects on Monday.**
   - According to the problem, Robert collects 20 shells on Monday.

2. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collects on Monday.**
   - The problem states that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday.
   - Since Robert collects 20 shells, we can calculate Kylie's collection as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, Kylie collects 25 shells on Monday.

3. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.**
   - The problem states that on Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.
   - Since we found that Kylie collected 25 shells on Monday, we can calculate her collection on Tuesday as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
