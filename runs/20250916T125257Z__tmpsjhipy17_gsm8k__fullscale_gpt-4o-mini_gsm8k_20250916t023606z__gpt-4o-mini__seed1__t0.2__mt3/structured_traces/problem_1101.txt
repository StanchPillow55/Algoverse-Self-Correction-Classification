To solve the problem, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran given the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito.

1. **Identify the distances run by Amber and Micah:**
   - Amber ran 8 miles.
   - Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Miles Micah ran} = 3.5 \times \text{Miles Amber ran} = 3.5 \times 8
     \]
     Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     3.5 \times 8 = 28
     \]
   So, Micah ran 28 miles.

2. **Calculate the total distance run by Amber and Micah:**
   - Now we add the distances run by Amber and Micah:
     \[
     \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = \text{Miles Amber ran} + \text{Miles Micah ran} = 8 + 28
     \]
     Performing the addition:
     \[
     8 + 28 = 36
     \]
   Therefore, Amber and Micah together ran 36 miles.

3. **Determine the distance run by Ahito:**
   - We know the total distance run by all three (Amber, Micah, and Ahito) is 52 miles. We can find out how many miles Ahito ran by subtracting the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:
     \[
     \text{Miles Ahito ran} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = 52 - 36
     \]
     Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     52 - 36 = 16
     \]
   Thus, Ahito ran 16 miles.

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of miles Ahito ran is:
     \[
     \boxed{16}
     \]
