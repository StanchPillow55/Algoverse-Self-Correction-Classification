To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Jim's college education in terms of loans and lost income, and then determine how long it will take him to earn back that amount after he graduates.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Loans

Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years. Therefore, the total amount of loans he accumulates is:

\[
\text{Total Loans} = \text{Loan per year} \times \text{Number of years}
\]
\[
\text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Lost Income

Before college, Jim had a job that paid him $25,000 per year. Since he is in college for 4 years, the total amount of income he loses while studying is:

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \text{Income per year} \times \text{Number of years}
\]
\[
\text{Lost Income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost of College

Now, we can find the total cost of Jim's college experience, which includes both the loans and the lost income:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Lost Income}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate New Income After Graduation

After graduating, Jim's income triples due to his college degree. Therefore, his new income is:

\[
\text{New Income} = 3 \times \text{Old Income}
\]
\[
\text{New Income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Time to Earn Back Total Cost

Now we need to determine how long it will take Jim to earn back the total cost of college, which is $300,000, at his new income of $75,000 per year. We can find the time required by dividing the total cost by his new income:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{New Income}}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Jim **4 years** to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
