To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold and then calculate the total earnings from those sales.

1. **Determine the number of bags sold**:
   The orchard sells apples in bags of 10. We know that a total of 2000 apples were sold. To find out how many bags were sold, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag.

   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = 200
   \]

   So, the orchard sold 200 bags of apples.

2. **Calculate the total earnings**:
   Each bag is sold for $5. To find the total earnings, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 1000
   \]

Thus, the orchard earned a total of $1000 from selling the apples.

**Final Answer**: The orchard earned $1000 for selling the apples.
