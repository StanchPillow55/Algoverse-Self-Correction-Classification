To solve the problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell in order to sell all of his candy.

1. **Initial Order**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   
2. **Sales**: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies. This means he has sold more than he initially ordered.

3. **Additional Order**: After selling 150 candies, Dale ordered 100 more candies.

Now, let's break down the total number of candies Dale has and how many he has sold:

- **Total Candies Ordered**: 
   - Initial order: 100 candies
   - Additional order: 100 candies
   - Total candies = 100 + 100 = 200 candies

- **Candies Sold**: Dale sold 150 candies.

4. **Candies Remaining**: To find out how many candies Dale has left to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has.

   \[
   \text{Candies remaining} = \text{Total candies} - \text{Candies sold}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Candies remaining} = 200 - 150 = 50
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.**
