To determine how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles the toys, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both the cars and the motorcycles.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars.**

Henry needs to assemble 57 cars, and each car requires 4 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Wheels for cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Wheels per car} = 57 \times 4
\]

Calculating this:

\[
57 \times 4 = 228
\]

So, Henry needs 228 wheels for the cars.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles.**

Henry also needs to assemble 73 motorcycles, and each motorcycle requires 2 wheels. Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Wheels for motorcycles} = \text{Number of motorcycles} \times \text{Wheels per motorcycle} = 73 \times 2
\]

Calculating this:

\[
73 \times 2 = 146
\]

So, Henry needs 146 wheels for the motorcycles.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles.**

Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles together:

\[
\text{Total wheels needed} = \text{Wheels for cars} + \text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 228 + 146
\]

Calculating this:

\[
228 + 146 = 374
\]

So, Henry needs a total of 374 wheels to assemble all the toys.

**Step 4: Calculate the number of wheels left after assembly.**

Henry starts with 650 wheels. To find out how many wheels will be left after he assembles the toys, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:

\[
\text{Wheels left} = \text{Total wheels available} - \text{Total wheels needed} = 650 - 374
\]

Calculating this:

\[
650 - 374 = 276
\]

**Final Answer:**

Henry will have **276 wheels left** after assembling all the toys.
