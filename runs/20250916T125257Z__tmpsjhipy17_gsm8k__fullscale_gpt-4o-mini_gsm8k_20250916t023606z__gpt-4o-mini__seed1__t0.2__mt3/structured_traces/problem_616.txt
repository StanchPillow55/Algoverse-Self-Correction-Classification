To find out how tall the beanstalk was after 3 weeks, we will break down the growth of the beanstalk week by week.

1. **Initial Height (Week 1)**:
   - After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
   \[
   \text{Height after Week 1} = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Growth in Week 2**:
   - The beanstalk doubled in height during the second week. To find the height after the second week, we multiply the height at the end of the first week by 2.
   \[
   \text{Height after Week 2} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Growth in Week 3**:
   - In the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches. To find the total height after the third week, we add the 4 inches to the height at the end of the second week.
   \[
   \text{Height after Week 3} = 6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now, we can summarize the growth of the beanstalk over the three weeks:
- After Week 1: 3 inches
- After Week 2: 6 inches
- After Week 3: 10 inches

Thus, the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{10} \text{ inches}
\]
