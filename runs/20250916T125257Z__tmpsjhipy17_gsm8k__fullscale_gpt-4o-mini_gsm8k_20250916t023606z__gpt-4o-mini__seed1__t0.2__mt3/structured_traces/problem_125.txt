To solve the problem, we need to determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.

2. **Information about the spoons:**
   - Julia bought \( x \) spoons.
   - Her husband bought 5 additional spoons.
   - Julia used 3 spoons to sample the stew.

3. **Calculate the total number of spoons before setting the table:**
   - The total number of spoons Julia had after buying her package and receiving the spoons from her husband, but before using any, is:
     \[
     x + 5
     \]
   - After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons remaining is:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2
     \]

4. **Total spoons when setting the table:**
   - We know that when Julia went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 2 = 12
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 12 - 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Thus, the final answer is that Julia bought **10 spoons** in the package.
