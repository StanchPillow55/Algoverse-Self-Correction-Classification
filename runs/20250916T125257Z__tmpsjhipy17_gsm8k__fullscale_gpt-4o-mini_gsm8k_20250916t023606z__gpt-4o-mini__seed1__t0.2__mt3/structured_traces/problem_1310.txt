To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about Aaron and Vanessa's running speeds and distances.

1. **Understanding the relationship between their speeds and distances:**
   - We know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Let's denote Vanessa's speed as \( v \) miles per minute. Therefore, Aaron's speed would be \( 2v \) miles per minute.
   - We also know that Vanessa can run twice as far as Aaron. If we denote the distance Aaron runs as \( d_A \), then Vanessa runs \( d_V = 2d_A \).

2. **Given information:**
   - Vanessa ran 4 miles. Thus, \( d_V = 4 \) miles.
   - Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.

3. **Finding Aaron's distance:**
   - Since Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     d_V = 2d_A \implies 4 = 2d_A \implies d_A = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, Aaron ran 2 miles.

4. **Calculating Aaron's speed:**
   - We know that Aaron completed his 2-mile run in 16 minutes. To find his speed, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

5. **Finding Vanessa's speed:**
   - Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, we have:
     \[
     2v = \frac{1}{8} \implies v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

6. **Calculating the time Vanessa took to run 4 miles:**
   - We can now find the time it took Vanessa to run her 4 miles using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the time Vanessa took to complete her part of the race is \( \boxed{64} \) minutes.
