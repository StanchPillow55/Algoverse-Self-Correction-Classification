To find the total number of legs that the pets in the store have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum those values.

1. **Identify the number of each type of pet:**
   - Dogs: 5
   - Cats: 2
   - Birds: 10

2. **Determine the number of legs for each type of pet:**
   - **Dogs:** Each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the dogs is:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from dogs} = 5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

   - **Cats:** Each cat also has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the cats is:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from cats} = 2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs}
     \]

   - **Birds:** Each bird has 2 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs for the birds is:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from birds} = 10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

3. **Sum the total number of legs from all pets:**
   Now, we add the total legs from dogs, cats, and birds:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from dogs} + \text{Total legs from cats} + \text{Total legs from birds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 20 \text{ legs (dogs)} + 8 \text{ legs (cats)} + 20 \text{ legs (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The total number of legs in the pet store is \( \boxed{48} \).
