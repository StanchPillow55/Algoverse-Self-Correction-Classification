To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total population of the school based on the information given about the boys.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that 40% of the school's population consists of boys, and there are 240 boys in total.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( P \) be the total population of the school. According to the problem, 40% of \( P \) is equal to the number of boys:
   \[
   0.40P = 240
   \]

3. **Solving for \( P \)**: To find \( P \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40}
   \]

4. **Calculating \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 240 \div 0.40 = 240 \times \frac{100}{40} = 240 \times 2.5 = 600
   \]
   So, the total population of the school is \( P = 600 \).

5. **Finding the number of girls**: Since we know the total population and the number of boys, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = P - \text{Number of boys} = 600 - 240 = 360
   \]

6. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of girls in the school is \( \boxed{360} \).
