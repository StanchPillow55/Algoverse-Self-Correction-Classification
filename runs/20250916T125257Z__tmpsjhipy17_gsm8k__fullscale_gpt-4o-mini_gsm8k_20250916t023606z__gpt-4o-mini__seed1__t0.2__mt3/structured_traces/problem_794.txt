To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to account for the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

1. **Count the female lions**: The problem states that there are 12 female lions.
   \[
   \text{Number of female lions} = 12
   \]

2. **Count the male lions**: The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of female lions} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
   \]

3. **Count the lion cubs**: The problem states that there are 14 lion cubs.
   \[
   \text{Number of lion cubs} = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of lions**: Now, we can find the total number of lions in the enclosure by adding the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of lion cubs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18
   \]
   \[
   18 + 14 = 32
   \]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
