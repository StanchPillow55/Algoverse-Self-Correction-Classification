To solve the problem, we need to determine how many yellow balloons Benny had, given that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna at a combination of red and yellow balloons.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

2. **Given information:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of red balloons \( r = 20 \).
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces at each yellow balloon, we can express the total pieces of bologna thrown as:
   \[
   2r + 3y = 58
   \]

4. **Substitute the known value:**
   We know \( r = 20 \), so we substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   2(20) + 3y = 58
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   40 + 3y = 58
   \]

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   To isolate \( y \), we first subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   3y = 58 - 40
   \]
   \[
   3y = 18
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is \( y = 6 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
