To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.**
2. **Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.**
3. **Determine the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month (assuming a typical month).

\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = \text{roses per week} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.

Now, we will sum the orders from each flower shop:

- First flower shop orders 20 roses per week.
- Second flower shop orders 15 roses per week.
- Third flower shop orders 30 roses per week.

First, we calculate the total weekly orders:

\[
\text{Total weekly orders} = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Now, we calculate the total orders for the month:

\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = \text{total weekly orders} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference between the total roses grown and the total roses ordered.

Now we find out how many roses Ford lacks:

\[
\text{Roses lacking} = \text{Total orders in a month} - \text{Total roses grown in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Roses lacking} = 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses}
\]

### Final Answer

Ford lacks **100 roses** to supply all the flower shops every month.
