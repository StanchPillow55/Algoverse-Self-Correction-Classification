To determine how many people Billy helps with their taxes, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th.**
2. **Determine how many days Billy takes off.**
3. **Calculate the number of days he actually works.**
4. **Calculate the total number of people he helps.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Now, we add these two periods together:

\[
\text{Total days} = 31 \text{ (March)} + 19 \text{ (April)} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many days Billy takes off

Billy takes 20% of the total days off. We calculate 20% of 50 days:

\[
\text{Days off} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days he actually works

To find out how many days Billy works, we subtract the days he takes off from the total days:

\[
\text{Days worked} = 50 \text{ (total days)} - 10 \text{ (days off)} = 40 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of people he helps

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps in one day is:

\[
\text{People helped per day} = 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[
\text{Total people helped} = 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}
\]

### Final Answer

Billy helps a total of **240 people** with their taxes.
