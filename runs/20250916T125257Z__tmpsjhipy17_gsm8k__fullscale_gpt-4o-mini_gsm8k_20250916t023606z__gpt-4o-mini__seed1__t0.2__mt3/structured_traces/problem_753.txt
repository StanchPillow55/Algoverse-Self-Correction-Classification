To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates.**
2. **Determine how many glasses and plates were broken.**
3. **Subtract the broken items from the initial quantities.**
4. **State the final counts of glasses and plates.**

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of glasses and plates

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses
- 4 dozen plates

First, we need to convert dozens into individual items. 

- **Glasses:**
  \[
  8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates:**
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine how many glasses and plates were broken

According to the problem:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

### Step 3: Subtract the broken items from the initial quantities

Now we will calculate the remaining glasses and plates after accounting for the broken items.

- **Remaining glasses:**
  \[
  96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates:**
  \[
  48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

### Step 4: State the final counts of glasses and plates

After the calculations, we find that Jeff has:
- 86 glasses remaining
- 42 plates remaining

### Final Answer

Jeff now has **86 glasses** and **42 plates**.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has after accounting for the broken items.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial quantities of glasses and plates.**

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses
- 4 dozen plates

First, we need to convert dozens into individual items:
- 1 dozen = 12 items

So, for glasses:
\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]

For plates:
\[
4 \text{ dozen plates} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of broken items.**

According to the problem:
- 10 glasses were broken
- 6 plates were broken

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining quantities of glasses and plates.**

Now, we will subtract the broken items from the initial quantities.

For glasses:
\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = \text{Initial glasses} - \text{Broken glasses}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
\]

For plates:
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = \text{Initial plates} - \text{Broken plates}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
\]

**Step 4: State the final answer.**

Now we can summarize the results:
- Jeff has 86 glasses remaining.
- Jeff has 42 plates remaining.

Thus, the final answer is:
Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates now.
