To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance that three kangaroos can cross in 18 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the kangaroos

Letâ€™s denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \). Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the total distance they cover.

The distance \( d \) that the kangaroos travel can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

For three kangaroos traveling at speed \( v \):

\[
d = 3v \times 18
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
d = 54v
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle \( v_t \) is:

\[
v_t = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance

Now we need to find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \( d = 54v \).

The combined speed of four turtles traveling at speed \( v_t \) is:

\[
\text{Combined speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times v_t = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time taken by the turtles

Using the distance formula again, we can find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to travel the distance \( d \):

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

Rearranging for time gives us:

\[
t = \frac{d}{\text{speed}}
\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[
t = \frac{54v}{2v}
\]

The \( v \) cancels out:

\[
t = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

### Final Answer

It will take four turtles a total of **27 hours** to travel across the highway.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway that three kangaroos can cross in 18 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the kangaroos

First, we know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \).

The speed of the kangaroos can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Since there are 3 kangaroos, we can denote their combined speed as \( 3v \), where \( v \) is the speed of one kangaroo. Therefore, we have:
\[
3v = \frac{D}{18}
\]

From this, we can express the distance \( D \):
\[
D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is:
\[
\text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the combined speed of the four turtles

If we have 4 turtles, their combined speed is:
\[
\text{Combined speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway

Now we can use the same formula for speed to find the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway. We know the distance \( D \) is \( 54v \) and the combined speed of the turtles is \( 2v \):
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{D}{\text{Combined speed of turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression

The \( v \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it will take four turtles a total of **27 hours** to cross the highway.

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given and break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Kangaroo Travel Time**:
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway. However, since they are not racing against each other (they are not competing), the time taken remains the same regardless of the number of kangaroos. Thus, it also takes 1 kangaroo 18 hours to cross the highway.

2. **Calculating the Speed of the Kangaroo**:
   - Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v_k \) and the distance across the highway as \( d \).
   - The time taken by the kangaroo to cross the highway can be expressed using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - For one kangaroo, we have:
     \[
     18 = \frac{d}{v_k}
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives us:
     \[
     d = 18 v_k
     \]

3. **Understanding the Turtle Speed**:
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of a turtle \( v_t \) is:
     \[
     v_t = \frac{1}{2} v_k
     \]

4. **Calculating the Time for Turtles**:
   - We need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( d \).
   - Using the same formula for time:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{d}{\text{Speed of turtles}}
     \]
   - The speed of 4 turtles is still \( v_t \), so we can substitute:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{d}{v_t} = \frac{d}{\frac{1}{2} v_k} = \frac{2d}{v_k}
     \]

5. **Substituting the Distance**:
   - We already established that \( d = 18 v_k \). Now substituting this into the equation for the time taken by the turtles:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{2(18 v_k)}{v_k} = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, it will take 4 turtles a total of **36 hours** to cross the highway.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
