To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we need to calculate the cost of tomatoes from both vendors and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily cost with the old vendor

The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.50 each. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

\[
\text{Daily cost with old vendor} = \text{Number of tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per tomato}
\]
\[
\text{Daily cost with old vendor} = 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily cost with the new vendor

The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.

\[
\text{Daily cost with new vendor} = \text{Number of tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per tomato}
\]
\[
\text{Daily cost with new vendor} = 500 \times 0.40 = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the daily savings

Now, we find the savings per day by subtracting the daily cost with the new vendor from the daily cost with the old vendor.

\[
\text{Daily savings} = \text{Daily cost with old vendor} - \text{Daily cost with new vendor}
\]
\[
\text{Daily savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings

To find the total savings over a week, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days).

\[
\text{Weekly savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times 7
\]
\[
\text{Weekly savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The tomato vendor saves **$350** a week by switching to the new vendor.

To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the old vendor**:
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - The cost per tomato from the old vendor is $0.50.
   - Therefore, the daily cost from the old vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes from the new vendor**:
   - The cost per tomato from the new vendor is $0.40.
   - Therefore, the daily cost from the new vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.40 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings**:
   - The savings per day by switching vendors can be calculated by subtracting the daily cost of the new vendor from the daily cost of the old vendor:
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} - \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings**:
   - To find the total savings over a week, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = \text{Daily Savings} \times 7
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching to the new supplier is **$350**.

**Final Answer**: $350
