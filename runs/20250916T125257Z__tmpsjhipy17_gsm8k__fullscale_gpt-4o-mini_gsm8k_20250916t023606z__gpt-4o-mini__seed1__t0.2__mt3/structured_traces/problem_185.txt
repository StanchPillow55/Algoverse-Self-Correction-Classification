To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Jenna picked based on the information given about her mother.

1. **Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother**: 
   According to the problem, Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked**: 
   The problem states that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked by taking half of the number of apples her mother picked.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mother picked}
   \]

   Substituting the number of apples her mother picked:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother**: 
   Now that we know how many apples each of them picked, we can find the total by adding the number of apples picked by Jenna to the number of apples picked by her mother.

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = 10 + 20
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total number of apples} = 30
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is 

   \[
   \boxed{30}
   \]
