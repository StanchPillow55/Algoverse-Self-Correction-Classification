To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class after a 20% increase, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of students**: Last year, there were 50 students enrolled.

2. **Calculate the increase in enrollment**: We need to find 20% of the initial enrollment (50 students). To do this, we can use the formula for percentage:

   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \text{Initial Number} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right)
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right)
   \]

   Simplifying this:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of students this year**: Now that we know the increase is 10 students, we can add this to the initial number of students:

   \[
   \text{Total Students This Year} = \text{Initial Number} + \text{Increase}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Students This Year} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is:

   \[
   \boxed{60}
   \]
