To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, given that there are four colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow. 

1. **Understanding the proportions of paint**:
   - We know that red, white, and purple paints are in equal amounts.
   - Half of the mural is yellow.

2. **Setting up the variables**:
   - Let \( r \) be the amount of red paint in pints.
   - Since red, white, and purple paints are equal, we can also say that the amount of white paint is \( r \) and the amount of purple paint is \( r \).
   - The amount of yellow paint is given as half of the total mural.

3. **Total amount of paint**:
   - The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.
   - Therefore, we can express the total amount of paint as:
     \[
     r + r + r + \text{(amount of yellow paint)} = 12
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3r + \text{(amount of yellow paint)} = 12
     \]

4. **Finding the amount of yellow paint**:
   - Since half of the mural is yellow, the amount of yellow paint is:
     \[
     \text{amount of yellow paint} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ pints}
     \]

5. **Substituting the yellow paint amount back into the equation**:
   - Now we can substitute the amount of yellow paint back into our equation:
     \[
     3r + 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Solving for \( r \)**:
   - To isolate \( r \), we first subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     3r = 12 - 6
     \]
     \[
     3r = 6
     \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     r = \frac{6}{3} = 2
     \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The amount of red paint used in the mural is \( r = 2 \) pints.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
