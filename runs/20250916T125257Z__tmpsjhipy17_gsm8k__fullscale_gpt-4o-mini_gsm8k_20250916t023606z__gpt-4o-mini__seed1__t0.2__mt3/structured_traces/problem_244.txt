Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of French Fries**:
   Griffin starts with 24 french fries.

2. **Kyle Takes Fries**:
   Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Billy Takes Fries**:
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Billy} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many fries Griffin has after Billy takes his share:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = 19 - 10 = 9
   \]

4. **Ginger Gives Fries to Griffin**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of fries that Ginger gives to Griffin. After receiving these fries, Griffin's total becomes:
   \[
   \text{Fries with Griffin after Ginger} = 9 + x
   \]

5. **Colby Takes Fries**:
   Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   \text{Fries taken by Colby} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]
   Now, we calculate how many fries Griffin has after Colby takes his share:
   \[
   \text{Fries left with Griffin} = (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
   \]

6. **Final Count of Fries**:
   We know that in the end, Griffin has 27 fries:
   \[
   7 + x = 27
   \]

7. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 27 - 7 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of fries that Ginger gave to Griffin is \( \boxed{20} \).
