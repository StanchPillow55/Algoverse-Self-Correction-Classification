To find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner, we will calculate the cost of each item she ordered: the bagel, the soup, and the cake.

1. **Cost of the Bagel**: 
   The problem states that the bagel costs $4.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Bagel} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Soup**: 
   The soup costs 25% more than the bagel. To find the cost of the soup, we first calculate 25% of the bagel's cost and then add that to the bagel's cost.

   \[
   \text{25% of Bagel's Cost} = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

   Now, we add this amount to the cost of the bagel to find the cost of the soup:

   \[
   \text{Cost of Soup} = \text{Cost of Bagel} + \text{25% of Bagel's Cost} = 4 + 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the Cake**: 
   The cake costs half of the price of the bagel. To find the cost of the cake, we divide the cost of the bagel by 2.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Cake} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of Dinner**: 
   Now, we will add the costs of all three items to find the total amount Aleksandra needs to pay.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Bagel} + \text{Cost of Soup} + \text{Cost of Cake}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner is:

\[
\boxed{11} \text{ dollars}
\]
