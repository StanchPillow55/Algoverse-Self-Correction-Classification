To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Johnny bought based on the information given about Mike's purchase.

1. **Identify how many face masks Mike bought:**
   - According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

2. **Determine how many face masks Johnny bought:**
   - The problem states that Johnny bought "2 more than thrice as many as Mike."
   - First, we need to calculate "thrice as many as Mike." Since Mike bought 5 face masks, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15
     \]
   - Now, we need to find "2 more than" this amount. We add 2 to the result we just calculated:
     \[
     15 + 2 = 17
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

In summary, Johnny bought a total of 17 face masks. 

**Final Answer: 17**
