To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**: 
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls initially is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows**:
   - The total number of cows after adding the new cows is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ initial cows} + 40 \text{ new cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Determine how many stalls there are**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.

5. **Calculate how many cows are placed in each stall**:
   - The total number of cows (240) will be divided equally among the 20 stalls. Therefore, the number of cows in each stall is:
     \[
     \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls**:
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:
     \[
     \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**:
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls initially is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial cows} = \text{Number of stalls} \times \text{Cows per stall} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after the purchase**:
   - The total number of cows after Mr. Sylas buys the new cows is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows after purchase} = \text{Total initial cows} + \text{New cows} = 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total, and Mr. Sylas will distribute the 40 new cows equally among these stalls.
   - The number of new cows per stall is:
     \[
     \text{New cows per stall} = \frac{\text{New cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cows in each stall after distribution**:
   - Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now each stall receives an additional 2 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in each stall after the distribution is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows per stall} = \text{Original cows per stall} + \text{New cows per stall} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls**:
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:
     \[
     \text{Total cows in 8 stalls} = \text{Cows per stall} \times \text{Number of stalls} = 22 \times 8 = 176 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{176}
\]

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**:
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Total number of cows in all stalls = Number of stalls Ã— Cows per stall
   \[
   \text{Total cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. **Add the new cows that Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   - Total number of cows after the purchase = Initial cows + New cows
   \[
   \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
   \]

3. **Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.
   - To find out how many cows will be in each stall after distributing the new cows, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.
   \[
   \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{\text{Total cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls**:
   - Since each stall now has 12 cows, we can find the total number of cows in 8 stalls by multiplying the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls we are considering.
   \[
   \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
   \[
   \boxed{96}
   \]
