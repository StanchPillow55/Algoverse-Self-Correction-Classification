To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the reservations over the course of the week.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from one reservation

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Each reservation includes:
- 2 meals at $5 each
- 1 bottle of wine at $5

First, we calculate the total cost for the meals:
\[
\text{Cost of meals} = 2 \text{ meals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/meal} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we add the cost of the wine:
\[
\text{Total cost per reservation} = \text{Cost of meals} + \text{Cost of wine} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue for one night

Now, we calculate the total revenue for one night with 6 reservations:
\[
\text{Total revenue per night} = \text{Total cost per reservation} \times \text{Number of reservations} = 15 \text{ dollars} \times 6 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue for a week

Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week. Therefore, we calculate the total revenue for the week:
\[
\text{Total revenue per week} = \text{Total revenue per night} \times \text{Number of days open} = 90 \text{ dollars} \times 2 = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total revenue that Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180 \text{ dollars}}
\]

To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   - Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   - Total reservations per week = Reservations per night × Days open per week
   \[
   \text{Total reservations per week} = 6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and a bottle of wine at $5.
   - Cost of meals = 2 meals × $5/meal = $10
   - Cost of wine = $5
   - Total cost per reservation = Cost of meals + Cost of wine
   \[
   \text{Total cost per reservation} = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue for the week:**
   - Total revenue per week = Total reservations per week × Total cost per reservation
   \[
   \text{Total revenue per week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Finally, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180} \text{ dollars}
\]
