To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of both songs and then sum them up.

1. **Duration of the first song**: 
   The first song is given as 5 minutes.

2. **Duration of the second song**: 
   The second song is 60% longer than the first song. To find the duration of the second song, we first need to calculate 60% of the first song's duration.

   - Calculate 60% of 5 minutes:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - Now, add this to the duration of the first song to find the duration of the second song:
     \[
     \text{Duration of the second song} = \text{Duration of the first song} + 60\% \text{ of the first song}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Duration of the second song} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total duration of the cassette**: 
   Now that we have the durations of both songs, we can find the total duration of the cassette by adding the two durations together:
   \[
   \text{Total duration} = \text{Duration of the first song} + \text{Duration of the second song}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time of the cassette is **13 minutes**. 

Final answer: **13 minutes**.
