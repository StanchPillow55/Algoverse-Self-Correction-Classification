To solve the problem, we need to establish the lifting capabilities of each character based on the information provided. We will start with Pompei and work our way up to Naruto.

1. **Pompei's Lifting Capability**:
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Saskay's Lifting Capability**:
   - According to the problem, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Therefore, Saskay's lifting capability is:
     \[
     \text{Saskay's height} = 12 \times \text{Pompei's height} = 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Kagiyami's Lifting Capability**:
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - Thus, Kagiyami's lifting capability is:
     \[
     \text{Kagiyami's height} = 4 \times \text{Saskay's height} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Naruto's Lifting Capability**:
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - Therefore, Naruto's lifting capability is:
     \[
     \text{Naruto's height} = 10 \times \text{Kagiyami's height} = 10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Convert Naruto's Height to Feet**:
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert Naruto's height from inches to feet:
     \[
     \text{Naruto's height in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Naruto can lift a mountain **40 feet** high.
