To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total number of letters in the words that Craig has spelled, and then we will determine how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. Finally, we will add both totals to find the overall count of letters.

1. **Calculate Craig's total letters:**
   - Craig has spelled 20 words.
   - Each word has 15 letters.
   - Therefore, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total letters by Craig} = \text{Number of words} \times \text{Letters per word} = 20 \times 15
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total letters by Craig} = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate Craig's brother's total letters:**
   - We know that Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's total.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled:

   \[
   \text{Total letters by Craig's brother} = \text{Total letters by Craig} + 50
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total letters by Craig's brother} = 300 + 50 = 350
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother:**
   - Now we will add the total letters spelled by Craig and his brother:

   \[
   \text{Total letters by both} = \text{Total letters by Craig} + \text{Total letters by Craig's brother}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total letters by both} = 300 + 350 = 650
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[
\boxed{650}
\]
