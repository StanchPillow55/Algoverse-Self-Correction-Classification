To determine how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his class schedule by day and then calculate the total hours for the entire semester.

### Step 1: Calculate weekly class hours

**Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- Kimo has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, the total hours for one day (Monday, Wednesday, or Friday) is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours per day} = 3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Since he has classes on three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), the total hours for these three days in one week is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours for M/W/F} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- Kimo has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, the total hours for one day (Tuesday or Thursday) is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours per day} = 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Since he has classes on two days (Tuesday and Thursday), the total hours for these two days in one week is:
  \[
  \text{Total hours for T/Th} = 4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate total weekly hours

Now, we can add the total hours from both parts of the week:
\[
\text{Total weekly hours} = \text{Total hours for M/W/F} + \text{Total hours for T/Th}
\]
\[
\text{Total weekly hours} = 9 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total hours for the semester

The semester lasts for 16 weeks. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
\text{Total semester hours} = \text{Total weekly hours} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total semester hours} = 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Kimo spends a total of **272 hours** attending classes in one semester.
