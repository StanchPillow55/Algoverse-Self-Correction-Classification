To determine how much money Kelly has left in her budget after shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of the items in her cart step by step.

1. **Cost of Bacon**:
   - Kelly has 5 packs of bacon that cost a total of $10.
   - Therefore, the cost of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of bacon} = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Chicken**:
   - Each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon.
   - Since the total cost of 5 packs of bacon is $10, the cost of one pack of bacon is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of one packet of chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per packet of chicken} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, so the total cost for chicken is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of chicken} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of Strawberries**:
   - Kelly has 3 packs of strawberries, each priced at $4.
   - Therefore, the total cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of strawberries} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries.
   - Since each pack of strawberries costs $4, the cost of one pack of apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pack of apples} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Kelly has 7 packs of apples, so the total cost for apples is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of apples} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of All Items**:
   - Now we can calculate the total cost of all items in Kelly's cart:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bacon} + \text{Cost of chicken} + \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Budget**:
   - Kelly's budget is $65. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = \text{Budget} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = 65 - 60 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the amount of money Kelly has left in her budget is \(\boxed{5}\) dollars.
