To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

1. **Identify the selling price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$350,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. We can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 350,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. We can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 350,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   The total cost includes the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 = 367,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 367,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find the difference between the total cost and her budget:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9,500
   \]

Thus, the total price of the house is **$9,500** more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

**Final Answer: $9,500**

To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

### Step 1: Calculate the Brokerage Fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Transfer Fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the House
Now we can find the total cost of the house by adding the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 59,500 = 409,500
\]

### Step 4: Compare Total Cost to Budget
Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
\]

### Final Answer
The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 9,500

To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. Then we will compare this total cost to her budget of $400,000.

**Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.**

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.**

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

Now we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 = 367,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 367,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
\]

**Step 4: Compare the total cost to Mrs. Cruz's budget.**

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9,500
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
