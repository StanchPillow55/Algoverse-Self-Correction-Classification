To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem down into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days.
Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days.

\[
\text{Eggs eaten in first 30 days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days.
Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.

\[
\text{Eggs eaten in next 30 days} = 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over 60 days.
Now, we add the number of eggs eaten in both periods:

\[
\text{Total eggs eaten} = 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[
\text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
\]

### Final Answer
Chester will need **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.

To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem down into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days.**

Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days:
\[
\text{Eggs in first 30 days} = 3 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 90 \, \text{eggs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days.**

Chester increases his intake to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days:
\[
\text{Eggs in next 30 days} = 5 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{eggs}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over the 60 days.**

Now, we add the number of eggs from both periods:
\[
\text{Total eggs} = 90 \, \text{eggs} + 150 \, \text{eggs} = 240 \, \text{eggs}
\]

**Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.**

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
\[
\text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \, \text{eggs}}{12 \, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20 \, \text{dozens}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Chester will need **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.

To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we will break the problem down into two parts based on his egg consumption.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is:
     \[
     5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over the 60 days:**
   - Now, we add the eggs from both periods:
     \[
     90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Thus, Chester will need a total of **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.

**Final Answer: 20 dozens**
