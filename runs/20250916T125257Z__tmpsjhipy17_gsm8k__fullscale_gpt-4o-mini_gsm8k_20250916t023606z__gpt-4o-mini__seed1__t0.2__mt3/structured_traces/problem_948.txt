To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper.**
2. **Determine the commission for each type of newspaper.**
3. **Add the commissions together to find the total commission.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper

**New York Times:**
- Price per copy = $5
- Number of copies sold = 6

Total sales from New York Times:
\[
\text{Total Sales NYT} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Wall Street Journal:**
- Price per copy = $15
- Number of copies sold = 10

Total sales from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Total Sales WSJ} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the commission for each type of newspaper

**Commission for New York Times:**
- Commission rate = 10%

Commission from New York Times:
\[
\text{Commission NYT} = \text{Total Sales NYT} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Commission for Wall Street Journal:**
- Commission rate = 8%

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Commission WSJ} = \text{Total Sales WSJ} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Add the commissions together to find the total commission

Total commission earned:
\[
\text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission NYT} + \text{Commission WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers.

To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the commission from the New York Times:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 6
   - **Cost per copy:** $5
   - **Commission rate:** 10%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the New York Times:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from New York Times} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from New York Times} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 10
   - **Cost per copy:** $15
   - **Commission rate:** 8%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the Wall Street Journal:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total commission earned:**
   Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
   \[
   \text{Total commission} = \text{Commission from New York Times} + \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers. 

Final answer: **$15**
