To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of dragons each prince has slain based on the information given.

1. **Prince Thaddeus**:
   - He slew 100 dragons.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = 100
   \]

2. **Prince Arthur**:
   - He slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Arthur, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

3. **Prince Walter**:
   - He slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Walter, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = 2 \times \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

4. **Prince Bruce**:
   - He slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Bruce, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Now, we have calculated the number of dragons slain by each prince:
- Prince Thaddeus: 100 dragons
- Prince Arthur: 75 dragons
- Prince Walter: 150 dragons
- Prince Bruce: 30 dragons

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Prince Bruce has slain } 30 \text{ dragons.}
\]
