To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons will wash based on their ages, and then find out how many oranges remain unwashed.

1. **Determine the ages of the sons:**
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son. Therefore, the youngest son is:
     \[
     \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges washed by both sons:**
   - The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 8 oranges.
   - The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which is 4 oranges.
   - Therefore, the total number of oranges washed is:
     \[
     \text{Total washed} = \text{Oldest son's oranges} + \text{Youngest son's oranges} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of unwashed oranges:**
   - Will initially bought 15 oranges.
   - To find the number of unwashed oranges, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
     \[
     \text{Unwashed oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total washed} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The number of oranges left unwashed is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]
