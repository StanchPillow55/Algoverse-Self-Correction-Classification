To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave:**
   - We know that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
   - There are 100 riders in total.

   To find the number of riders who can stay upright, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of riders who can stay upright} = 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of women who can stay upright:**
   - Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
   
   To find the number of women who can stay upright, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of women who can stay upright} = 60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15
   \]

3. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright:**
   - To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright.
   
   The number of men who can stay upright is:
   \[
   \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = \text{Total riders who can stay upright} - \text{Number of women who can stay upright}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **10 men can stay upright on the wave**.
