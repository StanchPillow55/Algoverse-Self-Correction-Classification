To solve the problem, we need to determine how many onions and potatoes Sophia bought based on the information given about Rose's purchases.

1. **Identify Rose's Purchases**:
   - Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes.
   - Therefore, the total number of items Rose bought is:
     \[
     \text{Total items Rose bought} = \text{Onions} + \text{Potatoes} = 12 + 4 = 16
     \]

2. **Understand the Relationship**:
   - The problem states that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.
   - Let \( S \) represent the total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought.

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, we can express Rose's total purchases in terms of Sophia's purchases:
     \[
     4S = 16
     \]
   - Here, \( 4S \) represents the total number of items Rose bought, which we calculated to be 16.

4. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     S = \frac{16}{4} = 4
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes combined.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The total number of onions and potatoes that Sophia bought at the market is \( \boxed{4} \).
