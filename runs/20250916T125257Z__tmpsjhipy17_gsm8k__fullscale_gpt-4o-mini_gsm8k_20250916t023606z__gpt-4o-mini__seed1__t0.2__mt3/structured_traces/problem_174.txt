To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it takes him to peel and cut each potato.

1. **Time to Peel One Potato**:
   - Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato.
   - To convert this into seconds (since the cutting time is given in seconds), we use the conversion factor that 1 minute = 60 seconds:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 90 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Time to Cut One Potato**:
   - Billy takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

3. **Total Time for One Potato**:
   - Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut one potato:
   \[
   \text{Total time for one potato} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cut}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time for one potato} = 90 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 95 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Total Time for 60 Potatoes**:
   - To find the total time for 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by the number of potatoes:
   \[
   \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert Total Time into Minutes**:
   - To convert seconds back into minutes, we divide by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = \frac{5700 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 95 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is **95 minutes**.

Final answer: **95 minutes**.
