To determine how much more Jairus will earn than Jenny after completing 20 tasks each, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jairus's earnings**:
   - Jairus earns $0.8 for each task he completes.
   - He completed 20 tasks.
   - Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jairus's earnings} = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Earnings per task} = 20 \times 0.8
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     20 \times 0.8 = 16
     \]
   - So, Jairus earns **$16**.

2. **Calculate Jenny's earnings**:
   - Jenny earns $0.5 for each task she completes.
   - She also completed 20 tasks.
   - Therefore, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jenny's earnings} = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Earnings per task} = 20 \times 0.5
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     20 \times 0.5 = 10
     \]
   - So, Jenny earns **$10**.

3. **Calculate the difference in earnings**:
   - Now, we need to find out how much more Jairus earns than Jenny:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Jairus's earnings} - \text{Jenny's earnings} = 16 - 10
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     16 - 10 = 6
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jairus earns **$6** more than Jenny.
