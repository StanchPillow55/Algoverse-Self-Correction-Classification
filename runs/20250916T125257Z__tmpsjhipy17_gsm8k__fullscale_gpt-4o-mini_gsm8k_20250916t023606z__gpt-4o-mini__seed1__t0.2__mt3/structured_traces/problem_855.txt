Let's denote the ages of each family member with variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \), \( s \), and \( m \) into the equation for the sum of ages.

First, we can express \( s \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
s = x - 2
\]

Now we substitute \( s \) into the sum equation:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b + m - 2 = 87
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + b + m = 89
\]

Next, we substitute \( m \) with \( 3b - 1 \):
\[
2x + b + (3b - 1) = 89
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 1 = 89
\]
Adding 1 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45
\]
Now we can express \( b \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
2b = 45 - x
\]
\[
b = \frac{45 - x}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( x \):
From \( x = b - 3 \):
\[
x = \frac{45 - x}{2} - 3
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
2x = 45 - x - 6
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
2x + x = 39
\]
\[
3x = 39
\]
Dividing by 3:
\[
x = 13
\]

Now that we have my age, we can find the ages of my brother, sister, and mom.

1. My brother's age:
   \[
   b = x + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

2. My sister's age:
   \[
   s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
   \]

3. My mom's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
   \]

Now, let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]

Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( m \) into the age sum equation.

First, substitute \( x \) from the first equation into the sum equation:
\[
(b - 3) + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
b - 3 + b + s + 3b - 1 = 87
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
5b + s - 4 = 87
\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[
5b + s = 91
\]

Next, substitute \( s \) from the second equation into this equation. From the second equation, we have:
\[
s = x - 2
\]
Substituting \( x = b - 3 \) into \( s \):
\[
s = (b - 3) - 2 = b - 5
\]

Now substitute \( s \) into the equation \( 5b + s = 91 \):
\[
5b + (b - 5) = 91
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
6b - 5 = 91
\]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[
6b = 96
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
b = 16
\]

Now that we have my brother's age, we can find my age:
\[
x = b - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

Next, we can find my sister's age:
\[
s = b - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
\]

Finally, we can find my mom's age:
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out, so my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]

Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = x - 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( s \) and \( m \) in terms of \( b \) and \( x \) into the age sum equation.

Substituting \( s \) from equation 2:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b - 2 + m = 87
\]

Now substituting \( m \) from equation 3:
\[
2x + b - 2 + (3b - 1) = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 3 = 87
\]
Adding 3 to both sides:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 45 - 2b \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we can substitute equation 5 into equation 1:
\[
45 - 2b = b - 3
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
45 + 3 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 48 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 16
\]

Now substituting \( b = 16 \) back into equation 5 to find \( x \):
\[
x = 45 - 2(16) = 45 - 32 = 13
\]

Now we can find \( s \) and \( m \):
Using \( x = 13 \):
\[
s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
\]
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the total:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
