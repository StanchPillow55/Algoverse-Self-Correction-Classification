To calculate the total cost of the streaming service for Bill over a period of 2 years, we need to break down the costs into different segments based on the pricing structure provided.

1. **First 6 months**: 
   - The cost for the first 6 months is $8 per month.
   - Total cost for the first 6 months:
     \[
     6 \text{ months} \times 8 \text{ dollars/month} = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Next 8 months**: 
   - After the first 6 months, the price increases to $12 per month.
   - The next 8 months will therefore cost:
     \[
     8 \text{ months} \times 12 \text{ dollars/month} = 96 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Remaining 10 months**: 
   - After the first 14 months (6 months at $8 and 8 months at $12), the price increases to $14 per month.
   - Since 2 years is 24 months, the remaining months after the first 14 months is:
     \[
     24 \text{ months} - 14 \text{ months} = 10 \text{ months}
     \]
   - The cost for these 10 months at $14 per month is:
     \[
     10 \text{ months} \times 14 \text{ dollars/month} = 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost**: 
   - Now, we sum up all the costs from each segment:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for first 6 months} + \text{Cost for next 8 months} + \text{Cost for remaining 10 months}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 48 \text{ dollars} + 96 \text{ dollars} + 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 284 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for 2 years of the streaming service is **$284**. 

Final answer: **$284**.
