To find out how much Tim spent in total on the fireworks, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the fireworks packs:**
   - The first pack of fireworks costs $400.
   - The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack:
     \[
     \text{Cost of second pack} = 2 \times 400 = 800
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   - Now, we add the costs of both packs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of packs} = 400 + 800 = 1200
     \]

3. **Calculate the discount on the total cost of the packs:**
   - Tim receives a 20% discount on the total cost of the packs. To find the discount amount, we calculate 20% of $1200:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 1200 = 240
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after applying the discount:**
   - We subtract the discount from the total cost of the packs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after discount} = 1200 - 240 = 960
     \]

5. **Add the cost of the finale firework:**
   - Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. We need to add this to the total cost after the discount:
     \[
     \text{Total cost including finale firework} = 960 + 150 = 1110
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Tim spent on fireworks is:
     \[
     \boxed{1110}
     \]
