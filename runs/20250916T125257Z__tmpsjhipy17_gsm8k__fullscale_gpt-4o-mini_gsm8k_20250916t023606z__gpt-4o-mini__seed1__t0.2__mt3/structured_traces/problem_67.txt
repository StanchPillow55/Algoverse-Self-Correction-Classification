To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, which includes diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of diamonds**:
   The problem states that there are 175 diamonds.

   \[
   \text{Number of diamonds} = 175
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rubies**:
   The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. To find the number of rubies, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds.

   \[
   \text{Number of rubies} = \text{Number of diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emeralds**:
   The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than rubies. To find the number of emeralds, we multiply the number of rubies by 2.

   \[
   \text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of gems**:
   Now that we have the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, we can find the total number of gems by adding these three quantities together.

   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = \text{Number of diamonds} + \text{Number of rubies} + \text{Number of emeralds}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of gems} = 175 + 140 + 280
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   \[
   175 + 140 = 315
   \]

   Then add the number of emeralds:

   \[
   315 + 280 = 595
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is 

   \[
   \boxed{595}
   \]
