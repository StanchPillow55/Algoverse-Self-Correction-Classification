To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, which includes both chicken sausages and fish sausages.

1. **Identify the number of chicken sausages**: 
   Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.

2. **Determine the number of fish sausages**: 
   The problem states that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Therefore, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + 6
   \]
   Substituting the number of chicken sausages:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish sausages} = 38 + 6 = 44
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sausages**: 
   To find the total number of sausages, we add the number of chicken sausages and the number of fish sausages together:
   \[
   \text{Total sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + \text{Number of fish sausages}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total sausages} = 38 + 44 = 82
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is:
   \[
   \boxed{82}
   \]
