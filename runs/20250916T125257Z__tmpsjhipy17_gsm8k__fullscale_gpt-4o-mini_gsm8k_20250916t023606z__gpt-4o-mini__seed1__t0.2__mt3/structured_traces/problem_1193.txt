To determine how much money Jason earned over the two-week period, we will calculate the earnings from each task he completed and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate earnings from each task:**
   - **Laundry:** Jason did his laundry once and earns $3.00 for it.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from laundry} = 1 \times 3.00 = 3.00
     \]

   - **Cleaning his room:** Jason cleaned his room once and earns $1.50 for it.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} = 1 \times 1.50 = 1.50
     \]

   - **Taking out the trash:** Jason took the trash out twice and earns $0.75 for each time.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from taking out the trash} = 2 \times 0.75 = 1.50
     \]

   - **Emptying the dishwasher:** Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times and earns $0.50 for each time.
     \[
     \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher} = 6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
     \]

2. **Sum up all the earnings:**
   Now, we will add up all the earnings from each task:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from laundry} + \text{Earnings from cleaning his room} + \text{Earnings from taking out the trash} + \text{Earnings from emptying the dishwasher}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 3.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 3.00
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
   \[
   3.00 + 1.50 = 4.50
   \]
   \[
   4.50 + 1.50 = 6.00
   \]
   \[
   6.00 + 3.00 = 9.00
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, Jason earned a total of **$9.00** over the two-week period.

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
