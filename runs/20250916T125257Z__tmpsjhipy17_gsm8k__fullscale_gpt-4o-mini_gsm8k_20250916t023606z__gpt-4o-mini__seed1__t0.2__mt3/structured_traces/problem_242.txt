To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week after he has stopped being pen pals with 2 of the 5 people.

### Step 1: Determine the number of pen pals Mike has now.
Mike originally had 5 pen pals. After stopping communication with 2 of them, the number of pen pals he has left is:

\[
5 - 2 = 3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of letters received per week.
Each of the 3 remaining pen pals sends 2 letters per week. Therefore, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:

\[
3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters per pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pages Mike receives per week.
Each letter is 5 pages long. Thus, the total number of pages Mike receives per week is:

\[
6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages per letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the total number of pages Mike writes in response.
Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages as he receives. Therefore, he writes:

\[
30 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the time it takes Mike to write these pages.
Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to write 30 pages, we calculate the total time in minutes:

\[
30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes per page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours.
To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
\frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total time Mike spends writing letters each week is:

\[
\boxed{3} \text{ hours}
\]
