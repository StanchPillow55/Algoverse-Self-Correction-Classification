To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.

2. **Determine the number of lessons per teacher**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of lessons in a day**:
   \[
   \text{Total lessons} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lessons} = 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons}
   \]

4. **Determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

5. **Calculate the total number of cleanings in a day**:
   \[
   \text{Total cleanings} = \text{Total lessons} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cleanings} = 8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings}
   \]

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned a total of 24 times in a day.

**Final Answer**: The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.
