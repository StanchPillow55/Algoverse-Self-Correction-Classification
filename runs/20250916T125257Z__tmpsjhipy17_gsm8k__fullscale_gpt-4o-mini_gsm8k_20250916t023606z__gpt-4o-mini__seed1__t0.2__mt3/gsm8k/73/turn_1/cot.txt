To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones over a 3-month installment period with a 2% interest charge, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones
Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. We can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged
The interest charged is 2% per month on the total cost. First, we need to calculate the interest for one month:

\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Total Cost} \times \text{Interest Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid each month
The total amount to be paid each month includes the original cost divided by the number of months plus the interest for that month. 

1. **Calculate the principal payment per month:**
   \[
   \text{Principal Payment per Month} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Principal Payment per Month} = \frac{750}{3} = 250
   \]

2. **Calculate the total payment for the first month:**
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 1} = \text{Principal Payment per Month} + \text{Monthly Interest}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 1} = 250 + 15 = 265
   \]

3. **Calculate the total payment for the second month:**
   The principal remains the same, but the interest will be calculated on the remaining balance after the first payment. The remaining balance after the first payment is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance after Month 1} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]
   Now calculate the interest on the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest for Month 2} = 500 \times 0.02 = 10
   \]
   Now calculate the total payment for the second month:
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 2} = 250 + 10 = 260
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment for the third month:**
   The remaining balance after the second payment is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Balance after Month 2} = 500 - 250 = 250
   \]
   Now calculate the interest on the remaining balance:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Interest for Month 3} = 250 \times 0.02 = 5
   \]
   Now calculate the total payment for the third month:
   \[
   \text{Total Payment for Month 3} = 250 + 5 = 255
   \]

### Step 4: Summarize the monthly payments
- Month 1: $265
- Month 2: $260
- Month 3: $255

### Final Calculation: Total Amount Paid
To find the total amount Shiela will pay over the 3 months, we can sum the monthly payments:
\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = 265 + 260 + 255 = 780
\]

### Final Answer
Shiela will pay $265 in the first month, $260 in the second month, and $255 in the third month. The total amount paid over the 3 months will be **$780**.
