To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones, including the interest, and then determine how much Shiela will pay each month over the 3-month installment period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones

Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. The total cost before interest is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged

The problem states that a 2% interest will be charged for each unit. Since the total cost is $750, we need to calculate the interest on this amount.

The interest can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

In this case:
- Principal = $750
- Rate = 2% = 0.02 (as a decimal)
- Time = 3 months (but since the interest is charged monthly, we will calculate it for each month separately)

Since the interest is charged monthly, we will calculate the interest for each month and then sum it up.

#### Monthly Interest Calculation

For each month, the interest charged will be:

\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = \text{Total Cost} \times \text{Rate}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

Since this interest is charged for 3 months, the total interest over 3 months will be:

\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Monthly Interest} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total Interest} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid

Now, we need to add the total interest to the total cost to find the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[
\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = \text{Total Cost} + \text{Total Interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount to be Paid} = 750 + 45 = 795
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment

Finally, we will divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months (3) to find out how much Shiela will pay each month:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount to be Paid}}{\text{Number of Months}}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
\]

### Final Answer

Shiela will pay **$265** each month for 3 months.
