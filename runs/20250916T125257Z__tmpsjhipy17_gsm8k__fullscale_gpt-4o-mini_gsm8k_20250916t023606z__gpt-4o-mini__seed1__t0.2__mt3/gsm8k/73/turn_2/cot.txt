To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones, including the interest charged, and then determine how much Shiela will pay each month over the 3-month installment period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones

Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. The total cost before interest is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of phones} \times \text{Cost per phone}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged

The interest charged is 2% per unit (cell phone) for the total cost. First, we need to calculate the total interest for the 3-month period.

The interest for one month on the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly interest} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Interest rate}
\]

\[
\text{Monthly interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

Since the interest is charged for 3 months, we multiply the monthly interest by 3:

\[
\text{Total interest for 3 months} = \text{Monthly interest} \times 3
\]

\[
\text{Total interest for 3 months} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid

Now, we add the total cost of the cell phones and the total interest to find the total amount Shiela will pay:

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Total interest}
\]

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 45 = 795
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, so we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment:

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be paid}}{3}
\]

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
\]

### Final Answer

Shiela will pay **$265** each month for 3 months.
