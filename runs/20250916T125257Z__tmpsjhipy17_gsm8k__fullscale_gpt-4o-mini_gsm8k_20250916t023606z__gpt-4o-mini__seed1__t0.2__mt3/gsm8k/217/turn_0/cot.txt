To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers in the vase, which consists of roses and dahlias.

1. **Identify the number of roses**: 
   We are given that there are 4 roses in the vase.

   \[
   \text{Number of roses} = 4
   \]

2. **Determine the number of dahlias**: 
   The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. To find the number of dahlias, we can set up the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7
   \]

   Substituting the number of roses into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of flowers**: 
   Now that we have the number of roses and dahlias, we can find the total number of flowers in the vase by adding the two quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = 4 + 11 = 15
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of flowers in the vase is 

   \[
   \boxed{15}
   \]
