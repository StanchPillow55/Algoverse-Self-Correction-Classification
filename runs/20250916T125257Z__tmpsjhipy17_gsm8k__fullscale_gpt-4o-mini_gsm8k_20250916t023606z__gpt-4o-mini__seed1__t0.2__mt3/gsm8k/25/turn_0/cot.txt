To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we will first calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased and then determine how much money she had left for the pizza.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken meal} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the packs of milk:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 5 packs of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Now, sum the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples} = 12 + 15 + 6
   \]
   \[
   = 33 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Marie has left for the pizza:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left for pizza} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of boxes of pizza Marie can buy:**
   Each box of pizza costs $8.50. To find out how many boxes she can buy with $17, we divide the amount left by the cost of one box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{17}{8.50}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{17}{8.50} \approx 2
   \]

   To confirm, we can calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 boxes of pizza} = 2 \times 8.50 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Check if she can buy 3 boxes:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 3 boxes of pizza} = 3 \times 8.50 = 25.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Since $25.50 is greater than $17, she cannot buy 3 boxes.

Thus, the maximum number of boxes of pizza Marie can order is 2.

**Final Answer:**
Marie ordered **2 boxes of pizza**.
