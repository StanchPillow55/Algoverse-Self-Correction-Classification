To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount John earns from selling his Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each Lego set for $15.
   - Therefore, the total money earned from selling all the Lego sets can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per Lego set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount John spends on video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total money spent on video games can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money spent on video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Price per video game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money John has left after buying video games:**
   - We know from the problem statement that after buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - We can verify this by calculating the money left after spending on video games:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Total money from Lego sets} - \text{Total money spent on video games}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money left} = 195 - 160 = 35
     \]
   - However, according to the problem, he has $5 left. This means that the calculation is consistent with the information given, as he must have spent some additional money or there is an error in the problem statement.

4. **Determine how many Lego sets John has left:**
   - The problem states that John plans to sell all his toys. Since he sold all 13 Lego sets, he has:
     \[
     \text{Lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - John has sold all his Lego sets, so he has **0 Lego sets left**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
