To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Lego sets John has left after selling them and using the money to buy video games.

1. **Calculate the total money John earns from selling Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each Lego set for $15.
   - Therefore, the total money earned from selling all Lego sets is:
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per Lego set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the video games is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Price per video game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total money John has after buying the video games:**
   - John initially has $195 from selling the Lego sets.
   - He spends $160 on video games.
   - After buying the video games, the remaining money is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total money from Lego sets} - \text{Total cost of video games}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Check the remaining money against the problem statement:**
   - According to the problem, after buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - We calculated that he has $35 left after the purchases. This indicates a discrepancy in the problem statement or the calculations.

5. **Determine how many Lego sets John has left:**
   - The problem states that John sells all his Lego sets. Therefore, after selling all 13 Lego sets, he has:
     \[
     \text{Lego sets left} = 13 - 13 = 0
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - John has **0 Lego sets left** after selling them all.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]
