To solve the problem, we need to determine how much blood one shark has and then calculate the total amount of blood for ten sharks.

1. **Determine the amount of blood in one shark:**
   - We know from the problem that each whale has 40 gallons of blood.
   - The problem states that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the amount of blood in one shark as follows:

   \[
   \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times \text{Blood in one whale}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Blood in one shark} = 3 \times 40 \text{ gallons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Blood in one shark} = 120 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of blood in ten sharks:**
   - Now that we know one shark has 120 gallons of blood, we can find the total amount of blood in ten sharks by multiplying the amount of blood in one shark by 10:

   \[
   \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times \text{Blood in one shark}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 10 \times 120 \text{ gallons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total blood in ten sharks} = 1200 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have is:

   \[
   \boxed{1200} \text{ gallons}
   \]
