Let's denote the ages of each family member with variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \), \( s \), and \( m \) into the equation for the sum of ages.

First, we can express \( s \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
s = x - 2
\]

Now we substitute \( s \) into the sum equation:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b + m - 2 = 87
\]
Adding 2 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + b + m = 89
\]

Next, we substitute \( m \) with \( 3b - 1 \):
\[
2x + b + (3b - 1) = 89
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 1 = 89
\]
Adding 1 to both sides gives:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45
\]
Now we can express \( b \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
2b = 45 - x
\]
\[
b = \frac{45 - x}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \( b \) back into the equation for \( x \):
From \( x = b - 3 \):
\[
x = \frac{45 - x}{2} - 3
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
2x = 45 - x - 6
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
2x + x = 39
\]
\[
3x = 39
\]
Dividing by 3:
\[
x = 13
\]

Now that we have my age, we can find the ages of my brother, sister, and mom.

1. My brother's age:
   \[
   b = x + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

2. My sister's age:
   \[
   s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
   \]

3. My mom's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
   \]

Now, let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
