Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( m \) into the age sum equation.

First, substitute \( x \) from the first equation into the sum equation:
\[
(b - 3) + b + s + (3b - 1) = 87
\]

Now, simplify this equation:
\[
b - 3 + b + s + 3b - 1 = 87
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
5b + s - 4 = 87
\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[
5b + s = 91
\]

Next, substitute \( s \) from the second equation into this equation. From the second equation, we have:
\[
s = x - 2
\]
Substituting \( x = b - 3 \) into \( s \):
\[
s = (b - 3) - 2 = b - 5
\]

Now substitute \( s \) into the equation \( 5b + s = 91 \):
\[
5b + (b - 5) = 91
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
6b - 5 = 91
\]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[
6b = 96
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
b = 16
\]

Now that we have my brother's age, we can find my age:
\[
x = b - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

Next, we can find my sister's age:
\[
s = b - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11
\]

Finally, we can find my mom's age:
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the sum of all ages:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out, so my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
