Let's define the ages of each family member using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = s + 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = x - 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3b - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + b + s + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( s \) and \( m \) in terms of \( b \) and \( x \) into the age sum equation.

Substituting \( s \) from equation 2:
\[
x + b + (x - 2) + m = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + b - 2 + m = 87
\]

Now substituting \( m \) from equation 3:
\[
2x + b - 2 + (3b - 1) = 87
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4b - 3 = 87
\]
Adding 3 to both sides:
\[
2x + 4b = 90
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2b = 45 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 45 - 2b \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

Now we can substitute equation 5 into equation 1:
\[
45 - 2b = b - 3
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
45 + 3 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad 48 = 3b \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 16
\]

Now substituting \( b = 16 \) back into equation 5 to find \( x \):
\[
x = 45 - 2(16) = 45 - 32 = 13
\]

Now we can find \( s \) and \( m \):
Using \( x = 13 \):
\[
s = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
\]
\[
m = 3b - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's verify the total:
\[
x + b + s + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
