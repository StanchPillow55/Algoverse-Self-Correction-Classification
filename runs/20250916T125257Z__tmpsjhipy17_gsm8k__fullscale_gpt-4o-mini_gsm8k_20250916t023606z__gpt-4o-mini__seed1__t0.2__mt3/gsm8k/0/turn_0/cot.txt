To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks each day.**
   Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes and uses for baking.**
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast.
   - She uses 4 eggs for baking muffins.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes and uses is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (for breakfast)} + 4 \text{ (for baking)} = 7 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after Janet's consumption.**
   To find out how many eggs are left for selling, we subtract the number of eggs Janet uses from the total number of eggs laid:
   \[
   16 \text{ (total eggs)} - 7 \text{ (eggs used)} = 9 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.**
   Janet sells the remaining 9 eggs at a price of $2 per egg. To find the total revenue from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of eggs by the price per egg:
   \[
   9 \text{ eggs} \times 2 \text{ dollars/egg} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.

Final Answer: **$18**
