To solve the problem, we will work through it step by step, keeping track of the number of french fries at each stage.

1. **Initial Amount of French Fries**: Let \( x \) be the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

2. **French Fries Eaten by Dave**: Dave ate 14 fries. After he ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

3. **French Fries Eaten by the Seagull**: The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. Since Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate:
   \[
   \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After the seagull ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   (x - 14) - 7 = x - 21
   \]

4. **French Fries Eaten by the Pigeons**: There are three pigeons, and each ate 3 fries. Therefore, the total number of fries eaten by the pigeons is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]
   After the pigeons ate, the number of fries left is:
   \[
   (x - 21) - 9 = x - 30
   \]

5. **French Fries Stolen by the Raccoon**: The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. The amount of fries remaining before the raccoon stole them is \( x - 30 \). The amount stolen by the raccoon is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}(x - 30)
   \]
   Therefore, the amount left after the raccoon stole the fries is:
   \[
   (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30)
   \]

6. **French Fry Taken by Ants**: The ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind. This means:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

7. **Solving the Equation**: Now we can solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]
   Adding 1 to both sides gives:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]
   Adding 30 to both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

Thus, the initial number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \).
