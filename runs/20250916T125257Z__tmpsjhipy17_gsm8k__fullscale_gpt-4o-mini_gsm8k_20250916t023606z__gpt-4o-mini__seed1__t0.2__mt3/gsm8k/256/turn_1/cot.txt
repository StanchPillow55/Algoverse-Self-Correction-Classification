To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we will calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - The value of 1 penny is $0.01.
   - Total value of pennies = 100 pennies × $0.01/penny = $1.00.

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - The value of 1 nickel is $0.05.
   - Total value of nickels = 40 nickels × $0.05/nickel = $2.00.

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - The value of 1 dime is $0.10.
   - Total value of dimes = 20 dimes × $0.10/dime = $2.00.

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - The value of 1 dollar bill is $1.00.
   - Total value of dollar bills = 40 bills × $1.00/bill = $40.00.

5. **Sum all the values:**
   - Total value = Value of pennies + Value of nickels + Value of dimes + Value of dollar bills
   - Total value = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = $45.00.

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is **$45.00**.
