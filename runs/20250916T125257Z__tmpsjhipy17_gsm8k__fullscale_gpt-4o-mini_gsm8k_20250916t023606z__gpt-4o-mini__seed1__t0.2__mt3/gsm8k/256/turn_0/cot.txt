To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum these values.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - Each penny is worth $0.01.
   - Therefore, the total value of the pennies is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - Each nickel is worth $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:
     \[
     40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth $0.10.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - Each dollar bill is worth $1.00.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dollar bills is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/bill} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Sum the total values:**
   - Now we add up all the values calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Value of pennies} + \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of dimes} + \text{Value of dollar bills}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is **$45.00**. 

Final answer: **$45.00**
