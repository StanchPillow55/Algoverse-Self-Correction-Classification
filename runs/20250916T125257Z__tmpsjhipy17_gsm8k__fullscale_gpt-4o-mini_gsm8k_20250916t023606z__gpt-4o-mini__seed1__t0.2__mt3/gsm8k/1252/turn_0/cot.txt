To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of robots, helmets, and footballs based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of helmets:**
   We are given that there are 20 helmets.

   \[
   \text{Number of helmets} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine the number of footballs:**
   The problem states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. This means that the number of helmets is half of the number of footballs. We can express this relationship mathematically:

   \[
   \text{Number of helmets} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of footballs}
   \]

   Rearranging this gives us:

   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times \text{Number of helmets}
   \]

   Substituting the number of helmets:

   \[
   \text{Number of footballs} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the number of robots:**
   The problem also states that there are half as many robots as helmets. This means that the number of robots is half of the number of helmets. We can express this relationship mathematically as well:

   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of helmets}
   \]

   Substituting the number of helmets:

   \[
   \text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of items:**
   Now that we have the number of robots, helmets, and footballs, we can calculate the total number of items Dominick saw:

   \[
   \text{Total items} = \text{Number of robots} + \text{Number of helmets} + \text{Number of footballs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of items Dominick saw is:

   \[
   \boxed{70}
   \]
