To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah has.**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
   - To find the total selling price, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.**
   - The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy, we divide the total selling price by the cost per meter:
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Selling Price}}{\text{Cost per Meter}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Since Sarah cannot buy a fraction of a meter of rope, we consider only the whole meters she can buy. Thus, she can buy 26 meters of new rope.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah buys.**
   - Now, we calculate the total cost for 26 meters of new rope:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 39 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah has left over after buying the new rope.**
   - To find out how much money Sarah has left over, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from the total selling price:
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 39 \, \text{dollars} = 1 \, \text{dollar}
     \]

Thus, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$1 left over**.

**Final Answer: $1**
