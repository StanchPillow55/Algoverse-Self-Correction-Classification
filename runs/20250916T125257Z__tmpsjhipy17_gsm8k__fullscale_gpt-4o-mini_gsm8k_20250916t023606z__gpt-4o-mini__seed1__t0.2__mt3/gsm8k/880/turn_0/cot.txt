To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope.**
2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with her earnings.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope.**
4. **Find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope.

Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long, and her friend wants to buy it for $2 per meter. 

To find the total earnings from selling the rope, we multiply the length of the rope by the price per meter:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with her earnings.

The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy, we divide her total earnings by the cost per meter of the new rope:

\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}}
\]
\[
\text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the new rope.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost of the new rope that Sarah can buy. Since she can buy approximately 26.67 meters, we multiply this by the cost per meter:

\[
\text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26.67 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} \approx 40 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope.

Now, we subtract the total cost of the new rope from her total earnings:

\[
\text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
\]
\[
\text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After selling the rope and buying the new rope, Sarah will have **$0 left over**.
