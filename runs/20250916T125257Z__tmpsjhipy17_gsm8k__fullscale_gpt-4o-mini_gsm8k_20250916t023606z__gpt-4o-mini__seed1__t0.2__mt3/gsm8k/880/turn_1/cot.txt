To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total selling price of the rope Sarah is selling.**
   - Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.
   - Her friend wants to buy the rope for $2 per meter.
   - Therefore, the total selling price can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Length of Rope} \times \text{Price per Meter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much new rope Sarah can buy with the profit.**
   - The cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter.
   - To find out how many meters of new rope Sarah can buy with the $40 she received from selling the old rope, we use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{\text{Total Money}}{\text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Meters of New Rope} = \frac{40 \, \text{dollars}}{1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter}} \approx 26.67 \, \text{meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the new rope Sarah can buy.**
   - Since Sarah can buy approximately 26.67 meters of new rope, we need to calculate the total cost for this amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = \text{Meters of New Rope} \times \text{Cost per Meter of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of New Rope} = 26.67 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} \approx 40 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Sarah has left over after buying the new rope.**
   - Since the total cost of the new rope is approximately $40, and Sarah received $40 from selling her old rope, we can find out how much money she has left over:
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Total Money from Sale} - \text{Total Cost of New Rope}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, after Sarah buys the new rope, she will have **$0 left over**.

**Final Answer: $0**
