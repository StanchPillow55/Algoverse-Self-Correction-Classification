To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the size of James's play set**: 
   James has 80 toys.

2. **Calculating the size of the sorted play set Jonathan wants**: 
   Jonathan wants a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Size of Jonathan's desired play set} = 5 \times \text{Size of James's play set} = 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Understanding Jonathan's current situation**: 
   The problem states that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach the size of his desired play set. We can express this mathematically. Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has. According to the problem:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**: 
   To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Jonathan currently has \( \boxed{398} \) toys.
