To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is represented by the combined length of the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit**: Since the shark's length is given in feet and the remoras' lengths are given in inches, we will convert the shark's length from feet to inches.

   - There are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, to convert the shark's length:
     \[
     \text{Length of shark in inches} = 10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**: Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Thus, we can calculate their total length:
   \[
   \text{Combined length of remoras} = 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**: To find the percentage, we will use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Combined length of remoras}}{\text{Length of shark}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

5. **Multiply by 100 to convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%
