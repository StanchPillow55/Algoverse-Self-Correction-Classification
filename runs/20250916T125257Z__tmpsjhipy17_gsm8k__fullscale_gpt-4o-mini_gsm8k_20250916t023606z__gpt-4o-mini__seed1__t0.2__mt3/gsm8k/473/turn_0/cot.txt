To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage the combined length of the remoras is of the shark's body length.

1. **Convert the shark's length to inches**:
   The shark is 10 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert feet to inches:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**:
   Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Therefore, we can calculate the total length of the remoras:
   \[
   2 \text{ remoras} \times 6 \text{ inches/remora} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**:
   To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, the "part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches):
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

5. **Convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%
