To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage of the shark's body length is represented by the combined length of the remoras.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit

1. **Shark's Length**: The shark is 10 feet long. We can convert this to inches since the remoras are measured in inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Remoras' Length**: Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras.
   - The combined length of the remoras is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage

Now we need to find out what percentage the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) is of the shark's length (120 inches).

The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
In this case, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "Whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches).

Substituting the values into the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{120} \right) \times 100
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation

1. Calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]

2. Convert to percentage:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

### Final Answer

The combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.
