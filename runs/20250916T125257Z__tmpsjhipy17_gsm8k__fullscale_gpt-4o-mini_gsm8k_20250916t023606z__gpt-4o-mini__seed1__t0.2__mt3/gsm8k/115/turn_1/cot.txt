To determine how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought.**
2. **Determine the new selling price after the 50% increase.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.**
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of the Lumber

Sasha has:
- Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each.
- Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each.

**Cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times 10 \text{ dollars/board} = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost of 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times 16 \text{ dollars/board} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total cost of all lumber:**
\[
\text{Total cost} = 100 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the New Selling Price After the 50% Increase

The prices of lumber have increased by 50%. We need to calculate the new selling prices for each type of board.

**New selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{New price} = 10 \text{ dollars} + (0.50 \times 10 \text{ dollars}) = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

**New selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{New price} = 16 \text{ dollars} + (0.50 \times 16 \text{ dollars}) = 16 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Revenue from Selling the Lumber

**Revenue from selling 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times 15 \text{ dollars/board} = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Revenue from selling 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
\[
\text{Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times 24 \text{ dollars/board} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total revenue from all lumber:**
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Profit

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 270 \text{ dollars} - 180 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Sasha makes a profit of **$90**.
