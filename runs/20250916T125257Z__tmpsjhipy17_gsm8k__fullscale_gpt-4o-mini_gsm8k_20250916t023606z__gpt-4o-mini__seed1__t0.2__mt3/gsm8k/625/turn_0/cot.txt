To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
2. **Determine how many of those flowers have bloomed.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers

Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, and each row has 20 flowers. To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:

\[
\text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of flowers per row}
\]
\[
\text{Total flowers} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

So, there are a total of 200 flowers in Arianna's garden.

### Step 2: Determine how many flowers have bloomed

We know that currently, \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed. To find the number of flowers that have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

\[
\text{Number of bloomed flowers} = \text{Total flowers} \times \frac{4}{5}
\]
\[
\text{Number of bloomed flowers} = 200 \times \frac{4}{5}
\]

Now, we can calculate \( 200 \times \frac{4}{5} \):

First, calculate \( 200 \div 5 \):

\[
200 \div 5 = 40
\]

Now, multiply by 4:

\[
40 \times 4 = 160
\]

Thus, the number of flowers that have bloomed is:

\[
\text{Number of bloomed flowers} = 160
\]

### Final Answer

The number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is \( \boxed{160} \).
