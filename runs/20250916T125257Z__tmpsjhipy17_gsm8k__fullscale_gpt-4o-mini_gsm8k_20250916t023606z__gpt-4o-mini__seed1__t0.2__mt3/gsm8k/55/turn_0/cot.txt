To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of lollipops Jean has after eating some.**
2. **Calculate how many bags can be filled with the remaining lollipops.**

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Lollipops

Jean starts with 30 lollipops. After eating 2 lollipops, we need to subtract the number of lollipops eaten from the total.

\[
\text{Remaining lollipops} = \text{Total lollipops} - \text{Lollipops eaten}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining lollipops} = 30 - 2 = 28
\]

So, Jean has 28 lollipops left.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Bags

Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags can be filled, we will divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag.

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Remaining lollipops}}{\text{Lollipops per bag}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

### Final Answer

Jean can fill **14 bags** with the remaining lollipops.
