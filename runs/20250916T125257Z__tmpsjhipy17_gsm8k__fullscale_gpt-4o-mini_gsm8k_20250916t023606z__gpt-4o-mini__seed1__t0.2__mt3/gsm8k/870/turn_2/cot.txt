To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.

1. **Calculate Madeline's Contribution**:
   - Total monthly grocery cost = $400
   - Madeline pays 60% of this amount.
   \[
   \text{Madeline's contribution} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Keenan's Contribution**:
   - Since Madeline pays 60%, Keenan pays the remaining 40%.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's contribution} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Keenan's Weekly Spending**:
   - The month has 4 weeks, so we divide Keenan's total contribution by 4 to find out how much he spends per week.
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Keenan spends **$40 per week** on groceries.

Final answer: **$40**
