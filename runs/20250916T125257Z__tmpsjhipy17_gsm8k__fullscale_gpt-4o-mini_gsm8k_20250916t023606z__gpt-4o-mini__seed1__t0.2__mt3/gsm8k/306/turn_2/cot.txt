To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of loaves produced**:  
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning**:  
   According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales**:  
   After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to find out how many loaves are left.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening**:  
   The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.  
   First, we calculate half of the remaining loaves:  
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**:  
   Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many are sold in the afternoon:  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon**.
