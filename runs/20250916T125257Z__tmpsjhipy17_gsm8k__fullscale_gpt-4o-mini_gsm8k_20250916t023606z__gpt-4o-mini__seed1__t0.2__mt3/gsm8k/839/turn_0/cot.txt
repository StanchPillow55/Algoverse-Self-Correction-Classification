To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cows the farmer needs to produce a total of 25 liters of milk per day.

1. **Calculate the current milk production:**
   The farmer has 3 cows, and each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. Therefore, the total milk production from the 3 cows is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total milk from 3 cows} = \text{Number of cows} \times \text{Milk per cow}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total milk from 3 cows} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Determine the additional milk needed:**
   The farmer wants to produce a total of 25 liters of milk per day. We need to find out how much more milk is needed beyond the current production of 15 liters:

   \[
   \text{Additional milk needed} = \text{Desired milk} - \text{Current milk}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional milk needed} = 25 - 15 = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more cows are needed:**
   Each cow produces 5 liters of milk per day. To find out how many additional cows are needed to produce the extra 10 liters, we can use the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of additional cows needed} = \frac{\text{Additional milk needed}}{\text{Milk per cow}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of additional cows needed} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The farmer needs 2 more cows to produce a total of 25 liters of milk per day.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
