To solve the problem, we need to determine how many berries the sloth must pick up per trip down to the ground in order to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours.

1. **Understanding the Time Constraint**:
   - The sloth takes 4 hours for each trip (down to the ground, picking berries, and climbing back up).
   - In 8 hours, the sloth can make a maximum of:
     \[
     \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
     \]

2. **Total Berries Requirement**:
   - The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries in these 2 trips.

3. **Calculating Berries per Trip**:
   - To find out how many berries he needs to pick per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:
     \[
     \text{Berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, in order to collect 24 berries in 8 hours, is **12 berries**.

Final Answer: **12 berries** per trip.
