To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while applying a discount for the red food baskets.

1. **Identify the costs of the food baskets:**
   - Cost of one basket of green food = $25
   - Cost of one basket of red food = $18

2. **Determine the total cost without discounts:**
   Let's assume we buy \( g \) baskets of green food and \( r \) baskets of red food. Since we are buying a total of 3 baskets, we can express this as:
   \[
   g + r = 3
   \]

   The total cost without any discounts can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (g \times 25) + (r \times 18)
   \]

3. **Apply the discount for red food baskets:**
   We know that there is a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Therefore, the cost of red food after the discount becomes:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Cost of Red Food} = r \times (18 - 2) = r \times 16
   \]

4. **Revising the total cost with the discount:**
   The total cost with the discount applied is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (g \times 25) + (r \times 16)
   \]

5. **Consider different combinations of green and red baskets:**
   Since \( g + r = 3 \), we can consider the following combinations:
   - Case 1: \( g = 3, r = 0 \)
   - Case 2: \( g = 2, r = 1 \)
   - Case 3: \( g = 1, r = 2 \)
   - Case 4: \( g = 0, r = 3 \)

   We will calculate the total cost for each case.

   **Case 1: \( g = 3, r = 0 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (3 \times 25) + (0 \times 16) = 75 + 0 = 75
   \]

   **Case 2: \( g = 2, r = 1 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (2 \times 25) + (1 \times 16) = 50 + 16 = 66
   \]

   **Case 3: \( g = 1, r = 2 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (1 \times 25) + (2 \times 16) = 25 + 32 = 57
   \]

   **Case 4: \( g = 0, r = 3 \)**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = (0 \times 25) + (3 \times 16) = 0 + 48 = 48
   \]

6. **Summarize the total costs for each case:**
   - Case 1: $75
   - Case 2: $66
   - Case 3: $57
   - Case 4: $48

7. **Determine the minimum total cost:**
   The minimum total cost occurs in Case 4, where we buy 0 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, resulting in a total cost of $48.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
