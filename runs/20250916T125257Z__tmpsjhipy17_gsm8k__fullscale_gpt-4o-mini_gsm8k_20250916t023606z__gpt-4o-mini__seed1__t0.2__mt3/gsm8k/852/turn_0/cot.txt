To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while also considering the discount on the red food baskets.

1. **Identify the costs of the baskets:**
   - Cost of one basket of green food = $25
   - Cost of one basket of red food = $18

2. **Determine the total cost without discounts:**
   - Let's assume we buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food such that \( x + y = 3 \). 
   - We can consider different combinations of green and red baskets. However, the problem does not specify how many of each type we need to buy. For simplicity, let's assume we buy 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food. This is just one possible combination, and we will calculate the total cost based on this assumption.

3. **Calculate the cost for 1 basket of green food:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of green food} = 1 \times 25 = 25
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for 2 baskets of red food without discount:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of red food} = 2 \times 18 = 36
   \]

5. **Calculate the total discount for the red food:**
   - The discount is $2 for each basket of red food. Since we have 2 baskets:
   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for the red food after applying the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of red food after discount} = 36 - 4 = 32
   \]

7. **Calculate the total cost for all baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of green food} + \text{Cost of red food after discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 25 + 32 = 57
   \]

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay for 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food, after applying the discount, is **$57**.

**Final Answer: $57**
