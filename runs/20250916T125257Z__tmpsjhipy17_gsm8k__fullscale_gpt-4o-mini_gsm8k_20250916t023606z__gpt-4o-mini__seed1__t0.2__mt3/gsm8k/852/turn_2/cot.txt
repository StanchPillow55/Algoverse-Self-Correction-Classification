To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while also applying the discount for the red food.

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the food baskets
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18

### Step 2: Determine the number of baskets
We are buying a total of 3 baskets. We need to decide how many of each type of basket we are purchasing. For simplicity, let's assume we buy \( x \) baskets of green food and \( y \) baskets of red food such that:
\[ x + y = 3 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost without discounts
The total cost without any discounts can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = (25x) + (18y) \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount for red food
We are given a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Therefore, the cost of red food after applying the discount becomes:
\[ \text{Discounted Cost of Red Food} = 18y - 2y = 16y \]

### Step 5: Rewrite the total cost with the discount
Now we can rewrite the total cost including the discount:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 25x + 16y \]

### Step 6: Choose a combination of baskets
Since the problem does not specify how many of each type to buy, we can explore a few combinations. Let's consider two scenarios:
1. **Scenario 1:** 3 baskets of green food (0 red)
2. **Scenario 2:** 2 baskets of green food and 1 basket of red food
3. **Scenario 3:** 1 basket of green food and 2 baskets of red food
4. **Scenario 4:** 3 baskets of red food (0 green)

#### Scenario 1: 3 Green Baskets
- \( x = 3, y = 0 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(3) + 16(0) = 75 + 0 = 75 \)

#### Scenario 2: 2 Green Baskets and 1 Red Basket
- \( x = 2, y = 1 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(2) + 16(1) = 50 + 16 = 66 \)

#### Scenario 3: 1 Green Basket and 2 Red Baskets
- \( x = 1, y = 2 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(1) + 16(2) = 25 + 32 = 57 \)

#### Scenario 4: 3 Red Baskets
- \( x = 0, y = 3 \)
- Total Cost = \( 25(0) + 16(3) = 0 + 48 = 48 \)

### Step 7: Conclusion
The total costs for the different scenarios are:
- Scenario 1: $75
- Scenario 2: $66
- Scenario 3: $57
- Scenario 4: $48

The least amount you would pay is in Scenario 4, where you buy 3 baskets of red food, resulting in a total cost of **$48**.

### Final Answer
The total amount you will have to pay is **$48**.
