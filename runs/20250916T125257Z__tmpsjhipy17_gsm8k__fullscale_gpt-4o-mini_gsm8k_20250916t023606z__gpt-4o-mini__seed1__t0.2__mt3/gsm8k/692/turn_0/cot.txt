To find the price of a crate of fruit consisting of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges, we first need to determine the individual prices of each type of fruit.

1. **Determine the price of each fruit:**
   - The price of one apple is given as $0.5.
   - The price of one banana is twice the price of one apple:
     \[
     \text{Price of one banana} = 2 \times \text{Price of one apple} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The price of one orange is three times the price of one banana:
     \[
     \text{Price of one orange} = 3 \times \text{Price of one banana} = 3 \times 1.0 = 3.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total price for each type of fruit in the crate:**
   - For bananas:
     \[
     \text{Total price for bananas} = \text{Number of bananas} \times \text{Price of one banana} = 5 \times 1.0 = 5.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For apples:
     \[
     \text{Total price for apples} = \text{Number of apples} \times \text{Price of one apple} = 12 \times 0.5 = 6.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - For oranges:
     \[
     \text{Total price for oranges} = \text{Number of oranges} \times \text{Price of one orange} = 7 \times 3.0 = 21.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total price for the crate:**
   - Now, we sum the total prices for all the fruits:
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = \text{Total price for bananas} + \text{Total price for apples} + \text{Total price for oranges}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total price for the crate} = 5.0 + 6.0 + 21.0 = 32.0 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the price for the crate of fruit is \(\boxed{32.0}\) dollars.
