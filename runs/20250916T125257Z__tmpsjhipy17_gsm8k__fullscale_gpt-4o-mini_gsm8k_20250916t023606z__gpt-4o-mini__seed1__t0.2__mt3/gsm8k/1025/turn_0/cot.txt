To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the friends found during the Easter egg hunt.

1. **Total Eggs Hidden**: We know that the total number of eggs hidden is 100.

2. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins**: Each of the Smith twins found 30 eggs. Since there are two twins, we calculate the total number of eggs they found:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found by Smith twins} = 30 \text{ eggs/twin} \times 2 \text{ twins} = 60 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Remaining Eggs**: We need to find out how many eggs are left after the Smith twins have found their share. We subtract the number of eggs found by the twins from the total number of eggs:
   \[
   \text{Remaining eggs} = \text{Total eggs} - \text{Eggs found by Smith twins} = 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Eggs Found by Friends**: According to the problem, all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that out of the remaining 40 eggs, 10 were not found by the friends. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:
   \[
   \text{Eggs found by friends} = \text{Remaining eggs} - \text{Eggs not found by friends} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: The number of eggs found by the friends is 30.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
