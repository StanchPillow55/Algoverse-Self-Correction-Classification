To find out how much Mark pays for everything related to the purchase of the fleet of cars, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   - Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
   - Total cost of the cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - To find the total tax, we multiply the total cost of the cars by the tax rate.
   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration:**
   - The registration fee is $1,000 per car.
   - Total registration cost = Number of cars × Registration fee per car
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost including tax and registration:**
   - The total cost will be the sum of the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration costs.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Mark pays for everything is **$276,000**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{276,000}
\]
