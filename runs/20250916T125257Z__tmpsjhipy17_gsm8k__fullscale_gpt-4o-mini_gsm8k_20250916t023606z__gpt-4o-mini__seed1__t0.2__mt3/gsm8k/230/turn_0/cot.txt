To find out how much Mark pays for everything when he buys a fleet of 12 cars, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   Each car costs $20,000. Since Mark buys 12 cars, we can calculate the total cost of the cars as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Cost per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   Mark pays a 10% tax on the total cost of the cars. We can calculate the tax amount as follows:

   \[
   \text{Tax} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration:**
   Mark also pays $1,000 for registration for each car. We can calculate the total registration cost as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Registration cost per car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid:**
   Now we can find the total amount Mark pays by adding the total cost of the cars, the tax, and the total registration cost:

   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax} + \text{Total registration cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is:

\[
\boxed{276,000}
\]
