To calculate how much John pays for driving each year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus he gives to his driver.

### Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven per day
John's work is 30 miles away, and he has to go there and back. Therefore, the total distance he travels in one day is:

\[
\text{Total miles per day} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total miles driven per week
John works 5 days a week, so the total miles he drives in a week is:

\[
\text{Total miles per week} = \text{Total miles per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 60 \text{ miles} \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total miles driven per year
John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles he drives in a year is:

\[
\text{Total miles per year} = \text{Total miles per week} \times \text{Number of weeks per year} = 300 \text{ miles} \times 50 = 15,000 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of miles driven per year
John is charged $2 per mile driven. Therefore, the total cost for the miles driven in a year is:

\[
\text{Cost of miles driven} = \text{Total miles per year} \times \text{Cost per mile} = 15,000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total bonus paid per year
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus paid in a year, we multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Total bonus per year} = \text{Monthly bonus} \times \text{Number of months per year} = 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for driving per year
Now, we add the cost of miles driven and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[
\text{Total cost for driving per year} = \text{Cost of miles driven} + \text{Total bonus per year} = 30,000 \text{ dollars} + 1,800 \text{ dollars} = 31,800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total amount John pays for driving each year is:

\[
\boxed{31,800 \text{ dollars}}
\]
