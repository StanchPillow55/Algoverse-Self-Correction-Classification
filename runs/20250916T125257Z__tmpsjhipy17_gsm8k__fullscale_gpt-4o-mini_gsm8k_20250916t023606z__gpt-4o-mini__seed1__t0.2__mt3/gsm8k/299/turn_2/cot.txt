To determine how much John pays for the driving service each year, we need to calculate both the cost of the miles driven and the monthly bonus he gives to the driver. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven per day

John's work is 30 miles away, and since he travels to work and back home, the total distance driven in one day is:

\[
\text{Total distance per day} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance driven per week

John goes to work 5 days a week, so the total distance driven in one week is:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \text{Total distance per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 60 \text{ miles} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven per year

John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total distance driven in one year is:

\[
\text{Total distance per year} = \text{Total distance per week} \times \text{Number of weeks per year} = 300 \text{ miles} \times 50 \text{ weeks} = 15000 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of driving based on miles driven

The driving service charges $2 per mile. Therefore, the total cost for the miles driven in one year is:

\[
\text{Cost for miles driven} = \text{Total distance per year} \times \text{Cost per mile} = 15000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total bonus paid to the driver

John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus paid in a year, we need to multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year (12 months):

\[
\text{Total bonus per year} = \text{Monthly bonus} \times \text{Number of months} = 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for driving in a year

Finally, we add the total cost for miles driven and the total bonus paid to the driver to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[
\text{Total cost per year} = \text{Cost for miles driven} + \text{Total bonus per year} = 30000 \text{ dollars} + 1800 \text{ dollars} = 31800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

John pays a total of **$31,800** per year for driving.
