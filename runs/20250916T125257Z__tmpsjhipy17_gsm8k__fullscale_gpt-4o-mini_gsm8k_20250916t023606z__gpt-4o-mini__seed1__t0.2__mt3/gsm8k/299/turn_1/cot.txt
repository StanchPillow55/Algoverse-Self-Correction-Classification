To determine how much John pays for the driving service each year, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost based on miles driven and the monthly bonus given to the driver.

### Step 1: Calculate the total miles driven per day
John's work is 30 miles away, and he travels to work and back home each day. Therefore, the total distance he travels in one day is:

\[
\text{Total miles per day} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total miles driven per week
John works 5 days a week, so the total miles he drives in a week is:

\[
\text{Total miles per week} = \text{Total miles per day} \times \text{Number of workdays per week} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total miles driven per year
John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total miles he drives in a year is:

\[
\text{Total miles per year} = \text{Total miles per week} \times \text{Number of weeks per year} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost based on miles driven
The driving service charges $2 per mile. Therefore, the total cost based on miles driven per year is:

\[
\text{Cost based on miles} = \text{Total miles per year} \times \text{Cost per mile} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total bonus given to the driver per year
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus for the year, we multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Total bonus per year} = \text{Monthly bonus} \times \text{Number of months} = 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,800 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for driving per year
Finally, we add the cost based on miles driven and the total bonus given to the driver to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[
\text{Total cost per year} = \text{Cost based on miles} + \text{Total bonus} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1,800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31,800 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total amount John pays for driving each year is:

\[
\boxed{31,800} \text{ dollars}
\]
