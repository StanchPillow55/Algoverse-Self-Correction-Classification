To determine how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the hours for each day:**
   - On **Tuesdays**, Hallie practices for **1 hour**.
   - On **Thursdays**, she practices for **2 hours**.
   - On **Saturdays**, her practice lasts **twice as long** as her Tuesday practice.

2. **Calculate Saturday's practice duration:**
   - Since her Tuesday practice is **1 hour**, Saturday's practice will be:
     \[
     \text{Saturday's practice} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday's practice} = 2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Sum the total hours for the week:**
   - Now, we will add the hours from each day:
     - Tuesday: **1 hour**
     - Thursday: **2 hours**
     - Saturday: **2 hours**
   - Total hours for the week:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \text{Tuesday's hours} + \text{Thursday's hours} + \text{Saturday's hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Hallie had a total of **5 hours** of dance practice in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
