To determine how much money Shawnda made on her first day of providing the bike inflation service, we need to calculate the total number of tires she inflated and then convert that total into dollars.

1. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for bicycles:**
   - Each bicycle has 2 tires.
   - Shawnda had 5 people come by with bicycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of bicycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     5 \text{ bicycles} \times 2 \text{ tires/bicycle} = 10 \text{ tires}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for tricycles:**
   - Each tricycle has 3 tires.
   - Shawnda had 3 people come by with tricycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of tricycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     3 \text{ tricycles} \times 3 \text{ tires/tricycle} = 9 \text{ tires}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of tires inflated for the unicycle:**
   - A unicycle has 1 tire.
   - Shawnda had 1 person come by with a unicycle.
   - Therefore, the total number of unicycle tires inflated is:
     \[
     1 \text{ unicycle} \times 1 \text{ tire/unicycle} = 1 \text{ tire}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of tires inflated:**
   - Now, we add up all the tires inflated:
     \[
     10 \text{ (bicycle tires)} + 9 \text{ (tricycle tires)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle tire)} = 20 \text{ tires}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for inflating the tires:**
   - Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate.
   - Therefore, the total cost for inflating 20 tires is:
     \[
     20 \text{ tires} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/tire} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Shawnda made a total of **5 dollars** on her first day of providing the bike inflation service.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
