To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

### Day 1: Traveling Westward
Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.

- Distance covered by each train on Day 1 = 80 miles

### Day 2: Traveling Northward
The next day, both trains travel northward for 150 miles.

- Distance covered by each train on Day 2 = 150 miles

### Total Distance Calculation
Now, we will calculate the total distance covered by each train over the two days.

1. **Total distance for Day 1**:
   \[
   \text{Distance on Day 1} = 80 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Total distance for Day 2**:
   \[
   \text{Distance on Day 2} = 150 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance for both days**:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on Day 1} + \text{Distance on Day 2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer
The total distance covered by each train in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{230 \text{ miles}}
\]
