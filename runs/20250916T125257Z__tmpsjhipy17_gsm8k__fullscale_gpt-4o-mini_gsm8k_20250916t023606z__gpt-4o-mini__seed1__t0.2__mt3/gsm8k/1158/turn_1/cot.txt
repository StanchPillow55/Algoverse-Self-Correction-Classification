To determine how many more bottles of carrot juice Hortex needs to produce to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily energy demand for 2300 people**:
   Each bottle of juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. Therefore, to cover 100% of one person's daily energy demand, we would need 5 bottles (since \(100\% \div 20\% = 5\)).

   For 2300 people, the total number of bottles needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Determine how many bottles Hortex currently produces**:
   Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day.

3. **Calculate the additional bottles needed**:
   To find out how many more bottles are needed, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Current production}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Thus, Hortex would need to produce **7300 more bottles** of juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

**Final Answer**: 7300 bottles.
