To determine how many days it will take Lauren to complete the project, we first need to calculate how many days she will need for each type of picture scene: large, medium, and small.

### Step 1: Calculate Days for Large-Sized Picture Scenes
Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 45 large-sized picture scenes.

To find the number of days required for the large-sized scenes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Days for large scenes} = \frac{\text{Total large scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Days for large scenes} = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Days for Medium-Sized Picture Scenes
Lauren can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.

Using the same formula:

\[
\text{Days for medium scenes} = \frac{\text{Total medium scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Days for medium scenes} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Days for Small-Sized Picture Scenes
Lauren can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day. She needs to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.

Again, using the same formula:

\[
\text{Days for small scenes} = \frac{\text{Total small scenes}}{\text{Scenes per day}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Days for small scenes} = \frac{49}{7} = 7 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Days
Now we need to find the total number of days Lauren will take to complete all the picture scenes. Since she can work on different types of scenes simultaneously, we will take the maximum of the days calculated for each type.

\[
\text{Total days} = \max(\text{Days for large scenes}, \text{Days for medium scenes}, \text{Days for small scenes})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total days} = \max(9, 6, 7) = 9 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer
Lauren will take a total of **9 days** to create all of the picture scenes.
