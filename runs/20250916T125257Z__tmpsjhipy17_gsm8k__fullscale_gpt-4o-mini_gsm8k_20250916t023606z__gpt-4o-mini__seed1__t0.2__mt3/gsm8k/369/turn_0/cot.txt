To determine the total cost of the senior gifts, we will break down the problem into parts and calculate the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.

Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. There are 44 seniors.

\[
\text{Cost of picture frames} = \text{Number of seniors} \times \text{Cost per frame}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of picture frames} = 44 \times 20 = 880
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on the frames.

The etching costs an additional 20% of the cost of each frame. First, we calculate 20% of the cost of one frame.

\[
\text{Etching cost per frame} = 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
\]

Now, we calculate the total etching cost for all frames.

\[
\text{Total etching cost} = \text{Number of seniors} \times \text{Etching cost per frame}
\]
\[
\text{Total etching cost} = 44 \times 4 = 176
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins for the two seniors.

Two seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.

\[
\text{Cost of pins} = \text{Number of pins} \times \text{Cost per pin}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of pins} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of officers and the cost of the cords.

1/4 of the seniors are officers. We first calculate the number of officers.

\[
\text{Number of officers} = \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11
\]

Each officer receives a cord that costs $12.

\[
\text{Cost of cords} = \text{Number of officers} \times \text{Cost per cord}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of cords} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of all gifts.

Now we will sum up all the costs calculated in the previous steps:

1. Cost of picture frames: $880
2. Total etching cost: $176
3. Cost of pins: $10
4. Cost of cords: $132

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of picture frames} + \text{Total etching cost} + \text{Cost of pins} + \text{Cost of cords}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 880 + 176 + 10 + 132
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 1198
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is **$1198**.
