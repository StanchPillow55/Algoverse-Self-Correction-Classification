To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - **Monday:** Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
   - **Tuesday:** She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Wednesday:** Again, she removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Thursday:** She removed 48 Junebugs.
   - **Friday:** She removed 57 Junebugs.

2. **Total number of Junebugs removed:**
   Now, we sum the number of Junebugs removed each day:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add Monday and Tuesday:
     \[
     39 + 78 = 117
     \]
   - Next, add Wednesday:
     \[
     117 + 78 = 195
     \]
   - Then, add Thursday:
     \[
     195 + 48 = 243
     \]
   - Finally, add Friday:
     \[
     243 + 57 = 300
     \]

   So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 300 \text{ Junebugs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   Rita removed Junebugs over 5 days (Monday to Friday). The average is calculated by dividing the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{300}{5}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Average} = 60
   \]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \( \boxed{60} \).
