To determine how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheeses, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheeses she purchases and then subtract that cost from her initial amount of cash.

1. **Calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese:**
   - The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
   - Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese:**
   - The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
   - Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for Parmesan + Total cost for Mozzarella
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Amor has left:**
   - Amor starts with $50.
   - We subtract the total cost of the cheeses from her initial amount.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheeses, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

**Final Answer: $10**
