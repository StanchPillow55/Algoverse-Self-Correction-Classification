To determine how much money Amor will have left after buying the cheese, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of Parmesan cheese.**
   - The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound.
   - Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese.
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of Mozzarella cheese.**
   - The price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.
   - Amor buys 3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese.
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for Parmesan + Total cost for Mozzarella
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Amor has left after buying the cheese.**
   - Amor starts with $50.
   - Amount left = Starting amount - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheese, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

Final answer: **10 dollars**.
