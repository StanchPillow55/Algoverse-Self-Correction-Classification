To determine how much money Amor has left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the cheese she purchases and then subtract that from her initial amount of cash.

1. **Calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Parmesan cheese = $11
   - Amount of Parmesan cheese bought = 2 pounds
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Mozzarella cheese = $6
   - Amount of Mozzarella cheese bought = 3 pounds
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for Parmesan} + \text{Total cost for Mozzarella}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Amor has left:**
   - Initial amount of cash = $50
   - Amount spent on cheese = $40
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount spent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheese, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

**Final Answer: $10**
