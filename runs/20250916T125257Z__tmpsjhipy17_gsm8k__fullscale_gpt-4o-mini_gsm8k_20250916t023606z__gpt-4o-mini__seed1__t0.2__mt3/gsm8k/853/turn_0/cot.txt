To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

1. **Determine the total number of rooms**: 
   The problem states that there are 90 rooms at the motel.

2. **Calculate one-half of the rooms**: 
   To find out how many rooms one-half is, we divide the total number of rooms by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms to clean} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

3. **Determine the time taken to clean one room**: 
   According to the problem, it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room.

4. **Calculate the total time to clean 45 rooms**: 
   To find the total time to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time taken to clean each room:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours**: 
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is **15 hours**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{It would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.}
\]
