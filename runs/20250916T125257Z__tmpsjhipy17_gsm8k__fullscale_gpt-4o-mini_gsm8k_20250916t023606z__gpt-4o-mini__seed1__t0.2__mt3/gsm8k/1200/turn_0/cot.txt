To solve the problem, we need to translate the given information into a mathematical equation.

1. **Identify the variable**: Let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

2. **Translate the problem into an equation**: The problem states that "eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs" is equal to 40. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   4x + 8 = 40
   \]

3. **Solve the equation**:
   - First, we will isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x = 32
   \]

   - Next, we will solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{32}{4}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
