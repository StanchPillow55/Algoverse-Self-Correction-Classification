To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project using popsicle sticks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed**: 
   Bob needs a total of 56 popsicle sticks. Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes Bob needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box:

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total popsicle sticks}}{\text{Popsicle sticks per box}} = \frac{56}{8}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{56}{8} = 7
   \]

   So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

2. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   Each box of popsicle sticks costs $2.00. To find the total cost for 7 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box} = 7 \times 2.00
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   7 \times 2.00 = 14.00
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total cost for Bob to build his project is:

   \[
   \boxed{14.00}
   \] 

In conclusion, Bob will spend $14.00 to purchase the necessary popsicle sticks for his history project.
