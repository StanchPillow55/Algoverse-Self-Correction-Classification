To find the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.**
   - There are 50 students at the picnic.
   - Each student is given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student} = 50 \times 10 = 500
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.**
   - Mr. George eats 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.**
   - To find the total number of burritos consumed, we add the burritos consumed by the students and the burritos consumed by Mr. George:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed} = \text{Total burritos consumed by students} + \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 500 + 20 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos.**
   - George ordered a total of 600 burritos for the picnic.
   - To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
     \[
     \text{Total leftover burritos} = \text{Total burritos ordered} - \text{Total burritos consumed} = 600 - 520 = 80
     \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
