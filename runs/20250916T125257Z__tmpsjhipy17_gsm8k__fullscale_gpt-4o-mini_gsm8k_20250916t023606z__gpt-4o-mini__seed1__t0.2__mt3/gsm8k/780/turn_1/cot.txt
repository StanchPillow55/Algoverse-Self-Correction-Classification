To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information provided. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

### Step 1: Define the variables for Emma's score
- Enemies jumped on by Emma: \( E \)
- Berries collected by Emma: \( B \)
- Time left for Emma when she finishes the level: \( T \) seconds

The score for Emma can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

### Step 2: Define the variables for Ava's score
According to the problem:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( B + 3 \)
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( T - 4 \)

Now we can calculate Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

### Step 3: Expand Ava's score formula
Now let's expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
Combining like terms gives us:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the difference in scores
Now we will find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores we calculated:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the difference
When we simplify the expression:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T) = -25
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.
