To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information provided.

Let's define the variables for Emma's performance:
- Let \( e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( t \) be the time in seconds Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level.

Now, we can express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's performance:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies (8 more than Emma).
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries (3 more than Emma).
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Next, we can calculate the scores for both players using the scoring rules:
- Points for jumping on enemies: 10 points per enemy.
- Points for collecting berries: 5 points per berry.
- Points for time left on the timer: 30 points per second.

**Score Calculation:**

1. **Emma's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_E = 10e + 5b + 30t
   \]

2. **Ava's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
   \]

   Now, let's expand Ava's score:
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_A = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
   \]

**Finding the Difference in Scores:**
Now we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_A - \text{Score}_E
\]
Substituting the expressions we derived:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
Simplifying this:
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points less than Emma's score.

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is \(-25\).
