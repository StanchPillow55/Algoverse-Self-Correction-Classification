To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information given. Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumps on as \( E \) and the number of berries she collects as \( B \). 

### Step 1: Define the scores for Ava and Emma

**Emma's Score:**
- Points from enemies: \( 10E \)
- Points from berries: \( 5B \)
- Points from time left: \( 30T_E \) (where \( T_E \) is the time left for Emma)

Thus, Emma's total score \( S_E \) can be expressed as:
\[
S_E = 10E + 5B + 30T_E
\]

**Ava's Score:**
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so if Emma has \( T_E \) seconds left, Ava has \( T_E - 4 \) seconds left.

Thus, Ava's total score \( S_A \) can be expressed as:
\[
S_A = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T_E - 4)
\]

### Step 2: Expand Ava's score

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[
S_A = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T_E - 120
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T_E + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
S_A = 10E + 5B + 30T_E - 25
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between their scores

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
S_A - S_E = (10E + 5B + 30T_E - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T_E)
\]
The \( 10E \), \( 5B \), and \( 30T_E \) terms cancel out:
\[
S_A - S_E = -25
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.
