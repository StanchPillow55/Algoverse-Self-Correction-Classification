To determine how much money James has, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he found: one quarter, two nickels, and seven dimes. We'll calculate the value of each type of coin separately and then sum them up.

1. **Value of the quarter**:
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Since James found 1 quarter, its total value is:
     \[
     1 \text{ quarter} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Value of the nickels**:
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - Since James found 2 nickels, their total value is:
     \[
     2 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents/nickel} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Value of the dimes**:
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Since James found 7 dimes, their total value is:
     \[
     7 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 70 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Total value of all coins**:
   - Now we add the values of the quarter, nickels, and dimes together:
     \[
     25 \text{ cents (quarter)} + 10 \text{ cents (nickels)} + 70 \text{ cents (dimes)} = 105 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that James has is **105 cents**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{105}
\]
