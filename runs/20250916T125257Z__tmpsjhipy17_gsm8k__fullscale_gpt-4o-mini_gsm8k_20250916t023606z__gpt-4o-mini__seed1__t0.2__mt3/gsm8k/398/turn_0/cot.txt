To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Count the spiders**: 
   Nancy saw 90 spiders. 

   \[
   \text{Number of spiders} = 90
   \]

2. **Count the millipedes**: 
   According to the problem, there are 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders. To find the number of millipedes, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Number of spiders} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]

3. **Count the stink bugs**: 
   The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. We first calculate twice the number of millipedes:

   \[
   2 \times \text{Number of millipedes} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

   Now we subtract 12 from this result to find the number of stink bugs:

   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 60 - 12 = 48
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of bugs**: 
   Now we will add the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs together to find the total number of bugs Nancy counted:

   \[
   \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48
   \]

   Now we perform the addition:

   \[
   90 + 30 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 48 = 168
   \]

Thus, the total number of bugs Nancy counted is 

\[
\boxed{168}
\]
