To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have, and then set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
   - Let \( A_j \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B_a \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
   - Let \( B_j \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

2. **Information Given**:
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: 
     \[
     A_a = A_j + 8
     \]
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
     \[
     B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j
     \]
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
     \[
     B_j = A_j + 4
     \]
   - We know that Andrea has 52 apples:
     \[
     A_a = 52
     \]

3. **Substituting Known Values**:
   Since \( A_a = 52 \), we can substitute this value into the first equation:
   \[
   52 = A_j + 8
   \]
   To find \( A_j \):
   \[
   A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
   \]

4. **Finding Bananas for Jamal**:
   Now we can use \( A_j \) to find \( B_j \):
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
   \]

5. **Finding Bananas for Andrea**:
   Now we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
   \[
   B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

6. **Calculating Total Fruits**:
   Now we can calculate the total number of fruits (apples + bananas) for both Andrea and Jamal:
   - Total fruits for Andrea:
     \[
     \text{Total for Andrea} = A_a + B_a = 52 + 24 = 76
     \]
   - Total fruits for Jamal:
     \[
     \text{Total for Jamal} = A_j + B_j = 44 + 48 = 92
     \]

7. **Final Total Fruits**:
   Now we add the total fruits for both Andrea and Jamal:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 76 + 92 = 168
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
