Let's denote the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have using variables.

Let:
- \( A_a \) = number of apples Andrea has
- \( A_j \) = number of apples Jamal has
- \( B_a \) = number of bananas Andrea has
- \( B_j \) = number of bananas Jamal has

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:
   \[
   A_a = A_j + 8
   \]

2. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
   \[
   B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j
   \]

3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4
   \]

4. We know that Andrea has 52 apples:
   \[
   A_a = 52
   \]

Now, we can substitute \( A_a \) into the first equation to find \( A_j \):
\[
52 = A_j + 8
\]
Subtracting 8 from both sides gives:
\[
A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
\]

Now that we have \( A_j \), we can use it to find \( B_j \) using the third equation:
\[
B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
\]

Next, we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
\[
B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
\]

Now we have all the quantities:
- \( A_a = 52 \) (Andrea's apples)
- \( A_j = 44 \) (Jamal's apples)
- \( B_a = 24 \) (Andrea's bananas)
- \( B_j = 48 \) (Jamal's bananas)

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits:
\[
\text{Total fruits} = A_a + A_j + B_a + B_j
\]
Substituting the values we found:
\[
\text{Total fruits} = 52 + 44 + 24 + 48
\]

Calculating this step by step:
1. \( 52 + 44 = 96 \)
2. \( 96 + 24 = 120 \)
3. \( 120 + 48 = 168 \)

Thus, the total number of fruits is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]
