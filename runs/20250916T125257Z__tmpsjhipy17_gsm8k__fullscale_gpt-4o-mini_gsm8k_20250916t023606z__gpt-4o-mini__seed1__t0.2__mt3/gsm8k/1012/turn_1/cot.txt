To solve the problem, we need to determine the initial charge of Maria's power bank before she went to the park. We will work backwards from the final charge of 28% after the charging process.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - After 5 hours, it loses 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
   - The final charge remaining after this entire process is 28%.

2. **Calculating the charge after the 3 hours of 7% loss**:
   - Let \( C \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of the 3 hours (after the first 5 hours).
   - After losing 7% for 3 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as follows:
     - After 1 hour: \( C - 0.07C = 0.93C \)
     - After 2 hours: \( 0.93C - 0.07(0.93C) = 0.93C \times 0.93 = 0.8649C \)
     - After 3 hours: \( 0.8649C - 0.07(0.8649C) = 0.8649C \times 0.93 = 0.804357C \)

   Thus, after 3 hours of losing 7%, the charge remaining is \( 0.804357C \).

3. **Setting up the equation for the charge after the first 5 hours**:
   - We know that after the 3 hours of 7% loss, the remaining charge is 28%. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.804357C = 28
   \]
   - To find \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{28}{0.804357} \approx 34.8
   \]

4. **Calculating the charge after the first 5 hours of 9% loss**:
   - Let \( B \) be the charge of the power bank at the start of the 5 hours (before the first 5 hours).
   - After losing 9% for 5 hours, the charge remaining can be calculated as follows:
     - After 1 hour: \( B - 0.09B = 0.91B \)
     - After 2 hours: \( 0.91B - 0.09(0.91B) = 0.91B \times 0.91 = 0.8281B \)
     - After 3 hours: \( 0.8281B - 0.09(0.8281B) = 0.8281B \times 0.91 = 0.753571B \)
     - After 4 hours: \( 0.753571B - 0.09(0.753571B) = 0.753571B \times 0.91 = 0.685749B \)
     - After 5 hours: \( 0.685749B - 0.09(0.685749B) = 0.685749B \times 0.91 = 0.623057B \)

   Thus, after 5 hours of losing 9%, the charge remaining is \( 0.623057B \).

5. **Setting up the equation for the initial charge**:
   - We know that after the 5 hours of 9% loss, the charge remaining is \( C \), which we found to be approximately 34.8. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0.623057B = 34.8
   \]
   - To find \( B \):
   \[
   B = \frac{34.8}{0.623057} \approx 55.9
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **55.9%**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{55.9}
\]
