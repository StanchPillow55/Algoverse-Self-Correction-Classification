To find the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went out to the park, we need to work backwards from the final charge remaining after the charging sessions.

Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria left for the park.

1. **Charge Loss During the First 5 Hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - The amount of charge lost after 5 hours can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Charge lost in 5 hours} = 5 \times 9\% = 45\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining charge after 5 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining charge after 5 hours} = x - 0.45x = 0.55x
     \]

2. **Charge Loss During the Next 3 Hours:**
   - After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
   - The amount of charge lost in these 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Charge lost in 3 hours} = 3 \times 7\% = 21\%
     \]
   - The remaining charge after these 3 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining charge after 3 more hours} = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x
     \]

3. **Final Charge Remaining:**
   - We know that the final charge remaining after all the losses is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.34x = 28\%
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.34:
     \[
     x = \frac{28\%}{0.34}
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     x \approx 82.35\%
     \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **82.35%**. 

Final Answer: **82.35%**
