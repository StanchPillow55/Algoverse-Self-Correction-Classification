Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

1. **Calculate the charge after 5 hours:**
   - The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
   - The charge lost in 5 hours is:
     \[
     5 \times 9\% = 45\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining charge after 5 hours is:
     \[
     x - 0.45x = 0.55x
     \]

2. **Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours:**
   - After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
   - The charge lost in 3 hours is:
     \[
     3 \times 7\% = 21\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the remaining charge after these 3 hours is:
     \[
     0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x
     \]

3. **Set up the equation with the final charge:**
   - We know that the final charge remaining is 28%, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.34x = 28\%
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 0.34:
     \[
     x = \frac{28\%}{0.34}
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     x \approx 82.35\%
     \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **82.35%**.
