To determine the total cost of John's research, we will break the problem down into manageable steps.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for the first 5 months, the total funding is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Funding} = 100,000
   \]

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The research ends up taking 10 times longer than initially planned. Since the initial plan was for 5 months, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding required for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding Increase**: After the first 5 months, the funding required each month increases by 50%. We need to calculate the monthly funding for the months after the initial 5 months. The funding for the first 5 months is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Funding for First 5 Months} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \text{ per month}
   \]

   For the months after the first 5 months, the funding per month will be:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Funding After 5 Months} = 20,000 + 0.5 \times 20,000 = 20,000 + 10,000 = 30,000 \text{ per month}
   \]

5. **Total Funding for Remaining Months**: Now we can calculate the total funding required for the remaining 45 months:
   \[
   \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months} = 30,000 \times 45
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months} = 1,350,000
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the funding for the remaining months to find the total cost of the research:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Funding} + \text{Total Funding for Remaining Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 1,350,000 = 1,450,000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is:
\[
\boxed{1,450,000}
\]
