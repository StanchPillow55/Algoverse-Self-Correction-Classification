To determine the total cost of John's research, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for the first 5 months, the total funding is:
   \[
   \text{Initial Funding} = 100,000
   \]

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding for Remaining Months**: The problem states that every month after the first 5 months costs 50% more than the previous month. We need to calculate the funding for each of these 45 months.

   - **First Month After Initial Funding**: The first month after the initial funding will cost 50% more than the last month of the initial funding. Since the last month of the initial funding is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000, the cost for the first month after the initial funding is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Month 6} = 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000
     \]

   - **Subsequent Months**: Each subsequent month will also cost 50% more than the previous month. Therefore, we can express the cost for each month as follows:
     - Month 7: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
     - Month 8: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
     - Month 9: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
     - Month 10: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
     - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 30,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

5. **Sum of the Geometric Series**: The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms. In our case, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 30,000 \), and \( r = 1.5 \).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{1.5 - 1}
   \]

   First, we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \):
   \[
   1.5^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]
   (This value can be computed using a calculator or programming tool.)

   Now substituting back into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(11222.741 - 1)}{0.5} = 30,000 \times 22445.482 = 673364460
   \]

6. **Total Cost of Research**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the total cost of the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Initial Funding} + S_{45} = 100,000 + 673364460 = 673464460
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately:
\[
\boxed{673464460}
\]
