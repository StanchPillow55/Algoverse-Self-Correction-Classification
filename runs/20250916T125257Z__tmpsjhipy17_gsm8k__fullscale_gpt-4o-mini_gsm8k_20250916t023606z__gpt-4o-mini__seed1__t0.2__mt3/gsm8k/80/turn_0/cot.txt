To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of water each girl received**:
   - Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total 24 liters of water.
   - To find out how much water each girl got, we perform the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - Therefore, each girl received 4 liters of water.

2. **Calculate the total amount of water received by both girls**:
   - Since there are two girls, we multiply the amount each girl received by 2:
     \[
     \text{Total water for both girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of water received by the boy**:
   - The boy received 6 liters of water.

4. **Calculate the total amount of water distributed**:
   - Now, we add the total amount of water received by both girls and the boy:
     \[
     \text{Total water distributed} = \text{Total water for both girls} + \text{Water for the boy} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount of water**:
   - We started with 24 liters of water. To find out how much water is left after distributing 14 liters, we subtract the total distributed from the initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Water left} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Total water distributed} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **10 liters of water left**.
