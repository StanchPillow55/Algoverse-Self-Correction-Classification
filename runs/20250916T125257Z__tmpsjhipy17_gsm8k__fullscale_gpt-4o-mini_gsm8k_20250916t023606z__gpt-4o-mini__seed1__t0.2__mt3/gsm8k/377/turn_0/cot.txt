To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday:**
   Lucy sells apples at $4 each. She made $56 from selling the apples on Monday. To find out how many apples she sold, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold} = \frac{\text{Total money earned}}{\text{Price per apple}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

   So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday:**
   On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday:**
   On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days:**
   Now we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the apples picked on each day:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples on Monday} + \text{Apples on Tuesday} + \text{Apples on Wednesday}
   \]

   We already know:
   - Apples on Monday = 14 (sold)
   - Apples on Tuesday = 12
   - Apples on Wednesday = 24

   Now we add these values:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
