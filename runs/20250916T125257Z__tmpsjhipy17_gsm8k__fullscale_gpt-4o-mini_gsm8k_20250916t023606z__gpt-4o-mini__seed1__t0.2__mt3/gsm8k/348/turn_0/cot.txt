To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from tractors to silos, we will first calculate the daily revenue from both products and then find the percentage increase.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.

The factory sold 10 tractors a day at a price of $100 per tractor. 

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = \text{Number of Tractors Sold} \times \text{Price per Tractor}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.

Now, the factory sells 5 silos a day at a price of $220 per silo.

\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = \text{Number of Silos Sold} \times \text{Price per Silo}
\]
\[
\text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.

Now, we find the increase in daily revenue by subtracting the revenue from tractors from the revenue from silos.

\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} - \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}
\]
\[
\text{Increase in Revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in revenue.

To find the percentage increase, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Revenue}}{\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}} \right) \times 100
\]
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Final Answer

The factory is making **10% more** per day now by selling silos compared to when they were selling tractors.
