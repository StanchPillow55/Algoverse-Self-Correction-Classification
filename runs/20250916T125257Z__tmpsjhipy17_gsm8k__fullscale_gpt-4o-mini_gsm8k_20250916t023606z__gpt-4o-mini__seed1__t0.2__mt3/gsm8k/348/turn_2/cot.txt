To find out how much more the factory is making per day now compared to when they were making tractors, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors:**
   - Number of tractors sold per day = 10
   - Revenue per tractor = $100
   - Daily revenue from tractors = Number of tractors × Revenue per tractor
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos:**
   - Number of silos sold per day = 5
   - Revenue per silo = $220
   - Daily revenue from silos = Number of silos × Revenue per silo
   \[
   \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue:**
   - Increase in revenue = Daily revenue from silos - Daily revenue from tractors
   \[
   \text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue:**
   - Percentage increase = (Increase in revenue / Daily revenue from tractors) × 100%
   \[
   \text{Percentage increase} = \left(\frac{100}{1000}\right) \times 100\% = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the factory is making **10% more** per day now than when they were making tractors.

**Final Answer:** 10% more per day.
