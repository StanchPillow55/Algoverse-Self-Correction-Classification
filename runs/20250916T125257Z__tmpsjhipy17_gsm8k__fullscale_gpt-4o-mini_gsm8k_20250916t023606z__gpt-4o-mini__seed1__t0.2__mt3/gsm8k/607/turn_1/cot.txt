To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash.

1. **Determine the total number of washes per bottle**:
   According to the problem, the jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00 and provides 120 washes when using 2 pumps per wash. 

2. **Calculate the number of washes with 1 pump**:
   If 2 pumps are used for 120 washes, then using 1 pump will double the number of washes:
   \[
   \text{Number of washes with 1 pump} = 120 \text{ washes} \times 2 = 240 \text{ washes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per wash**:
   The total cost of the shampoo is $24.00. To find the cost per wash, we divide the total cost by the number of washes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per wash} = \frac{24.00}{240} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Convert the cost per wash to cost per pump**:
   Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Convert the cost from dollars to cents**:
   To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100:
   \[
   \text{Cost per pump in cents} = 0.10 \times 100 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that each pump costs **10 cents**.
