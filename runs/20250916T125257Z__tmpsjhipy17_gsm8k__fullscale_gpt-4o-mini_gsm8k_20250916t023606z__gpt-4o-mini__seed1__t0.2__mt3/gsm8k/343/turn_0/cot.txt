To solve the problem, we need to determine how many meters Tyson would run each day if he follows his coach's advice and then calculate the total distance he would cover in June.

1. **Determine the increase in distance**:
   Tyson currently runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than this distance.

   To find out how much more this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = \frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new daily distance**:
   Now, we add this increase to his original distance:
   \[
   \text{New daily distance} = 5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for the month of June**:
   June has 30 days. If Tyson runs 6000 meters each day, the total distance he would cover in June is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{New daily distance} \times \text{Number of days in June}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180000 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, if Tyson follows his coach's advice and runs 6000 meters every day for the month of June, the total distance he covers is:
   \[
   \boxed{180000} \text{ meters}
   \]
