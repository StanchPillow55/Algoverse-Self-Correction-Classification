To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the number of players in each category:

- Let \( d \) be the number of players on the defense.
- Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, we can express the number of offensive players as \( 2d \).
- The problem states that there is half the number of players on special teams as there is on defense, so we can express the number of special teams players as \( \frac{1}{2}d \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of team members:

\[
\text{Total members} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams}
\]

Substituting the expressions we defined:

\[
105 = 2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]

Now, let's combine the terms on the right side:

1. Combine \( 2d \) and \( d \):
   \[
   2d + d = 3d
   \]

2. Now add \( \frac{1}{2}d \) to \( 3d \):
   \[
   3d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
   \]

Now we have the equation:

\[
105 = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

To solve for \( d \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( \frac{2}{7} \):

\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side:

1. First, divide \( 105 \) by \( 7 \):
   \[
   105 \div 7 = 15
   \]

2. Now multiply by \( 2 \):
   \[
   15 \times 2 = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players in each category:

- Defense: \( d = 30 \)
- Offense: \( 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, let's check the total:

\[
30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The total is correct, confirming that our solution is accurate. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
