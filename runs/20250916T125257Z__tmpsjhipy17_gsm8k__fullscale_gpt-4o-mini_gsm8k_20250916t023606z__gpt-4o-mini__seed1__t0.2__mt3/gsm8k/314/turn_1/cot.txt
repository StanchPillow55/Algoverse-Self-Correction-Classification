Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   o = 2d
   \]

2. The number of players on special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

The total number of team members is given as 105. Therefore, we can express the total number of players as the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams:
\[
o + d + s = 105
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( d \):
\[
2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
(2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d) = 3d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]
To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can convert \( 3d \) to a fraction:
\[
3d = \frac{6}{2}d
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

Now we have:
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

To solve for \( d \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
d = 105 \div 7 \times 2 = 15 \times 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on offense and special teams:
- Offense: \( o = 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, check the total:
\[
o + d + s = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105
\]

The calculations confirm that the total is correct, so the final answer is indeed:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
