To solve the problem, we will break down the chores of each person and calculate the total time they spent on their respective tasks.

1. **Amalia's Chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Amalia} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Megan's Chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Megan} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Megan} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Dior's Chore:**
   - Dior did the laundry, and she took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Since Amalia took 4 hours, we can assume "well over" means at least 4 hours more. Therefore, we can calculate the minimum time Dior took:
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Dior} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Dior} = 4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Now, we will add the time taken by each person to find the total time spent on chores.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + \text{Time taken by Megan} + \text{Time taken by Dior}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is \( \boxed{18} \) hours.
