To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of apples in two boxes**:
   - We know that there are 40 apples in one box.
   - Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes of apples.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Apples per box} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Determine how many packs of apples can be made**:
   - Uncle Franky plans to pack the apples with 8 apples in each pack.
   - To find out how many packs he can make, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per pack}} = \frac{80}{8}
     \]

3. **Perform the division**:
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{80}{8} = 10
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the 80 apples he has from the two boxes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
