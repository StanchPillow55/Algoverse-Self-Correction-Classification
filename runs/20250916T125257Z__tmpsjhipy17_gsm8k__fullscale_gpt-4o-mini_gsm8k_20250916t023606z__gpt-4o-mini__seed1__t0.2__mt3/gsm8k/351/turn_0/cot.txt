To solve the problem, we need to determine how many plant pots April will need in total for the daisies and roses, and then subtract that from the number of plant pots she originally bought.

1. **Determine the number of pots needed for the daisies:**
   - The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.

2. **Determine the number of pots needed for the roses:**
   - The school asks for twice as many pots for the roses as they do for the daisies. 
   - Therefore, the number of pots needed for the roses is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ pots}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pots needed:**
   - Now, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses:
     \[
     30 \text{ (for daisies)} + 60 \text{ (for roses)} = 90 \text{ pots}
     \]

4. **Determine how many pots April has left over:**
   - April originally bought 100 plant pots. To find out how many she has left after donating the required pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the number of pots she bought:
     \[
     100 \text{ (original pots)} - 90 \text{ (needed pots)} = 10 \text{ pots}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - April has 10 plant pots left over after donating the required pots to the school.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
