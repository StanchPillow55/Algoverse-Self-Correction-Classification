To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of bread Abby and Josh eat together each day and then calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last.

1. **Determine the number of slices each person eats per day:**
   - Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day.
   - Josh eats twice as much as Abby. Therefore, Josh eats:
     \[
     2 \text{ slices} \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by both Abby and Josh per day:**
   - The total daily consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Abby's slices} + \text{Josh's slices} = 2 \text{ slices} + 4 \text{ slices} = 6 \text{ slices per day}
     \]

3. **Determine how many days the loaf of bread will last:**
   - The loaf of bread contains 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the total daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices per day}} = \frac{24 \text{ slices}}{6 \text{ slices per day}} = 4 \text{ days}
     \]

Therefore, the loaf of bread will last for **4 days**.

Final answer: **4 days**.
