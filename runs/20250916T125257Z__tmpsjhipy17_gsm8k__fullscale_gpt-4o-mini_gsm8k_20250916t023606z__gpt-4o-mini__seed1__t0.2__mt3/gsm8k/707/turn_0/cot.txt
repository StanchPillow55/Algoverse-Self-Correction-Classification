To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total water usage by Colorado City from the Colorado River**:
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 

2. **Calculate the percentage of water used for industrial purposes**:
   - Out of the water that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes. 
   - To find the percentage of the total river water that is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Industrial water usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\%
     \]
   - This means that 32% of the total water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes**:
   - Since 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes, the remaining 20% is for non-industrial purposes.
   - To find the percentage of the total river water that is used for non-industrial purposes by Colorado City, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Non-industrial water usage} = 40\% \times 20\% = 0.40 \times 0.20 = 0.08 \text{ or } 8\%
     \]
   - This means that 8% of the total water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

4. **Final answer**:
   - The percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is **8%**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8\%}
\]
