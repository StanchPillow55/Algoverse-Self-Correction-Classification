To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the book**: 
   The problem states that the book costs $4. 

   \[
   \text{Cost of the book} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the magazine**: 
   The problem states that the magazine costs half as much as the book. Since the book costs $4, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of the book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the pen**: 
   The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. Since we found that the magazine costs $2, we can calculate the cost of the pen:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the pen} = \text{Cost of the magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   After calculating the costs step by step, we find that the pen costs $1.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{The cost of the pen is } 1 \text{ dollar.}
\]
