To determine how many lemons Tim will need, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total amount of lemonade Tim needs:**
   - Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade for the party.
   - Allen wants 1 extra gallon, making the total:
     \[
     4 \text{ gallons} + 1 \text{ gallon} = 5 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of lemon juice needed for 5 gallons:**
   - The recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon.
   - Therefore, for 5 gallons, Tim needs:
     \[
     5 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 5 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of lemons needed for the extra tart gallon:**
   - The extra gallon that Allen wants is twice as tart. This means it will require double the amount of lemon juice compared to the regular gallons.
   - For the regular gallons (4 gallons), Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, totaling 4 cups.
   - For the extra tart gallon, he needs:
     \[
     2 \times 1 \text{ cup} = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total lemon juice needed:**
   - Now, we add the lemon juice needed for the 4 gallons and the extra tart gallon:
     \[
     4 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 6 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
     \]

5. **Determine how many lemons are needed:**
   - Tim found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.
   - Therefore, to find out how many lemons are needed for 6 cups of juice, we calculate:
     \[
     6 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 36 \text{ lemons}
     \]

Thus, Tim will need a total of **36 lemons** to make 5 gallons of lemonade, including the extra tart gallon for Allen.

**Final answer: 36 lemons**
