To solve the problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target and your current calorie consumption.

1. **Determine Remaining Calories**:
   You have a daily calorie target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. Therefore, the remaining calories you can consume are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calories per Serving of Chips**:
   According to the nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. Since the bag contains 5 servings, the total calories in the entire bag are:
   \[
   \text{Total calories in bag} = 250 \text{ calories/serving} \times 5 \text{ servings} = 1250 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate Calories per Gram**:
   The bag weighs 300 grams and contains 1250 calories. Therefore, the number of calories per gram of chips is:
   \[
   \text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1250 \text{ calories}}{300 \text{ grams}} \approx 4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}
   \]

4. **Determine Grams You Can Eat**:
   Now, we need to find out how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Grams of chips} = \frac{\text{Remaining calories}}{\text{Calories per gram}} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, you can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips.

Final Answer: **48 grams**
