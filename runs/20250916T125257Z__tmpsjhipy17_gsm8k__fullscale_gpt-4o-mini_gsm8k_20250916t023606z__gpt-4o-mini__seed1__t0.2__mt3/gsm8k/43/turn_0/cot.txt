To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories, given that you have already consumed 1800 calories.

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Calories
First, we need to find out how many calories you can still consume:

\[
\text{Remaining Calories} = \text{Daily Calorie Target} - \text{Calories Consumed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Calories per Serving
Next, we know that each serving of chips contains 250 calories. Since the bag has 5 servings, we can confirm the total calories in the bag:

\[
\text{Total Calories in Bag} = \text{Calories per Serving} \times \text{Number of Servings}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Calories in Bag} = 250 \times 5 = 1250 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Calories per Gram
Now, we need to find out how many calories are in each gram of chips. The total weight of the bag is 300 grams. Therefore, the calories per gram can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Calories per Gram} = \frac{\text{Total Calories in Bag}}{\text{Total Weight of Bag}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Calories per Gram} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.1667 \text{ calories/gram}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate How Many Grams You Can Eat
Now, we need to determine how many grams of chips you can eat with the remaining 200 calories. We can use the calories per gram to find this:

\[
\text{Grams of Chips} = \frac{\text{Remaining Calories}}{\text{Calories per Gram}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Grams of Chips} = \frac{200}{4.1667} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
You can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target of 2000 calories.
