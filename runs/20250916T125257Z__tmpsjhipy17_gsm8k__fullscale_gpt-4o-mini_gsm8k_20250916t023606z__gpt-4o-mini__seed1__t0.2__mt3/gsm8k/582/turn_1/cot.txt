To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of Juan's house based on the information provided about Herb's house and then calculate the combined value of both houses.

1. **Determine the value of Herb's house**: 
   Herb paid $76,000 for his house. This is the value we will use for calculations.

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house**:
   Juan's house is stated to be 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value.

   \[
   \text{30% of Herb's house} = 0.30 \times 76,000
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
   \]

   This means Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract this amount from Herb's house value:

   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = \text{Value of Herb's house} - \text{30% of Herb's house}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined value of both houses**:
   Now that we have the values of both houses, we can find the combined value:

   \[
   \text{Combined value} = \text{Value of Herb's house} + \text{Value of Juan's house}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is:

   \[
   \boxed{129,200}
   \]
