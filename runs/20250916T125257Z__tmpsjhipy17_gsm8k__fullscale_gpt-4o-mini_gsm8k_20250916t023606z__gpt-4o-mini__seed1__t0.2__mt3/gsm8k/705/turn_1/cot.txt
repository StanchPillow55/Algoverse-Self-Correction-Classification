To solve the problem, we need to determine how fast Martha's turtle can crawl based on the speed of her cat.

1. **Identify the speed of the cat**: The problem states that Martha's cat can run at a speed of 15 feet per second.

2. **Determine the speed of the turtle**: We know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle. We can express the speed of the turtle (let's call it \( T \)) in terms of the speed of the cat:
   \[
   \text{Speed of the cat} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the turtle}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the cat:
   \[
   15 \text{ feet/second} = 5 \times T
   \]

3. **Solve for the turtle's speed**: To find \( T \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   T = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

4. **Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**: Now that we know the turtle's speed is 3 feet per second, we can find out how far it can crawl in 40 seconds using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the turtle can crawl a total of 120 feet in 40 seconds.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120 \text{ feet}}
\]
