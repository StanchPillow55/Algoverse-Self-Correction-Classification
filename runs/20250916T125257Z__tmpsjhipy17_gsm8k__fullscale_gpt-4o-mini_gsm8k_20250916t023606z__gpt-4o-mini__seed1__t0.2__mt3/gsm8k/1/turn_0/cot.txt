To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of fiber needed to make a robe, which consists of blue fiber and white fiber.

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber needed**:
   The problem states that a robe takes **2 bolts of blue fiber**.

2. **Identify the amount of white fiber needed**:
   The problem also states that the robe takes **half that much white fiber**. Since we have 2 bolts of blue fiber, we need to calculate half of that amount for the white fiber:
   \[
   \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber**:
   Now, we need to add the amounts of blue and white fiber together to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total fiber} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts} + 1 \text{ bolt} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber needed to make the robe is:
   \[
   \boxed{3}
   \]
