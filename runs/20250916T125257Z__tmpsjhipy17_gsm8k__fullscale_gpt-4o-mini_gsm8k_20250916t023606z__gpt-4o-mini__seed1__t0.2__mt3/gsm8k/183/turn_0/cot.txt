To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team in the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times to determine how many seconds the faster team will win by.

### Team A (Well-Rounded Team)
Each member of Team A runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, we can calculate the total time for Team A as follows:

\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team B (Less Well-Rounded Team)
The first runner of Team B runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the times for each runner in Team B:

1. **First runner**: 60 seconds
2. **Second runner**: \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds
3. **Third runner**: \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds
4. **Fourth runner**: \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for Team B is:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Comparing the Times
Now we compare the total times of both teams:

- Team A: 220 seconds
- Team B: 222 seconds

To find out how many seconds Team A wins by, we subtract the total time of Team A from the total time of Team B:

\[
\text{Time difference} = \text{Total time for Team B} - \text{Total time for Team A}
\]
\[
\text{Time difference} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer
Team A wins by **2 seconds**.
