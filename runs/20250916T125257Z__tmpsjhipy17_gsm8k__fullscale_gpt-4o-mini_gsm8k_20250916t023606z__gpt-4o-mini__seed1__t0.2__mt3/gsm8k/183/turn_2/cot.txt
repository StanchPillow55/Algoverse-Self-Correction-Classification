To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team in the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times to determine how many seconds the faster team wins by.

### Team A (Well-rounded team)
Each member of Team A runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are 4 members, we can calculate the total time for Team A as follows:

\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds}
\]
\[
\text{Total time for Team A} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Team B (Less well-rounded team)
The first runner of Team B runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the time for each runner in Team B:

1. **First runner:** 60 seconds
2. **Second runner:** 60 seconds - 3 seconds = 57 seconds
3. **Third runner:** 57 seconds - 3 seconds = 54 seconds
4. **Fourth runner:** 54 seconds - 3 seconds = 51 seconds

Now, we can calculate the total time for Team B:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
60 + 57 = 117
\]
\[
117 + 54 = 171
\]
\[
171 + 51 = 222
\]

So, the total time for Team B is:

\[
\text{Total time for Team B} = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Finding the difference in times
Now we can find out how many seconds the faster team (Team A) wins by:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total time for Team B} - \text{Total time for Team A}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 222 \text{ seconds} - 220 \text{ seconds}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Conclusion
Team A, the well-rounded team, wins by 2 seconds.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
