To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of each animal based on the information provided about the pink frog, and then calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal along with the weight of the container itself.

1. **Weight of the Pink Frog**: 
   - The problem states that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Weight of the Blue Beetle**: 
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Therefore, the weight of the blue beetle is also 50 pounds.

3. **Weight of the Green Toad**: 
   - The pink frog weighs the same as the green toad. Therefore, the weight of the green toad is also 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the Yellow Snake**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. 
   - Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Weight of the Red Bird**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Red Bird} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Now we have the weights of all the animals:
- Pink Frog: 50 pounds
- Blue Beetle: 50 pounds
- Green Toad: 50 pounds
- Yellow Snake: 60 pounds
- Red Bird: 30 pounds

6. **Total Weight of the Animals**: 
   - We need to calculate the total weight of one of each animal:
   \[
   \text{Total Weight of Animals} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + \text{Weight of Blue Beetle} + \text{Weight of Green Toad} + \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} + \text{Weight of Red Bird}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
   \]
   \[
   = 240 \text{ pounds}
   \]

7. **Weight of the Container**: 
   - The problem states that the container weighs 20 pounds.

8. **Total Weight of the Container and Animals**: 
   - We now add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals:
   \[
   \text{Total Weight} = \text{Total Weight of Animals} + \text{Weight of Container}
   \]
   \[
   = 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{260} \text{ pounds}
\]
