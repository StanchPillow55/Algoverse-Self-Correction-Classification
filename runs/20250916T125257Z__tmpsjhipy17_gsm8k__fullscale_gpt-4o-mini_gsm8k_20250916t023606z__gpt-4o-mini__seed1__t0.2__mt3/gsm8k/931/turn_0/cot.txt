To solve the problem, we need to define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean using variables. Let's denote:

- \( P \) as Peter's age
- \( A \) as Paul's age
- \( J \) as Jean's age

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions we have into the equations to solve for the ages.

### Step 1: Substitute Paul's age in terms of Jean's age

From equation (2), we can express \( J \) in terms of \( A \):
\[
J = A - 10
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( J \) into the equation for Peter's age

Now, substitute \( J \) into equation (3):
\[
P = A + (A - 10)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2A - 10
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( P \) and \( J \) into the combined age equation

Now we substitute \( P \) and \( J \) into equation (1):
\[
(2A - 10) + A + (A - 10) = 100
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation

Combine like terms:
\[
2A - 10 + A + A - 10 = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4A - 20 = 100
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( A \)

Add 20 to both sides:
\[
4A = 120
\]
Now divide by 4:
\[
A = 30
\]

### Step 6: Find Jean's age

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( J \):
\[
J = A - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
\]

### Step 7: Find Peter's age

Finally, we can find \( P \):
\[
P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean are:
- Peter: 50 years
- Paul: 30 years
- Jean: 20 years

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Peter's age is } \boxed{50} \text{ years.}
\]
