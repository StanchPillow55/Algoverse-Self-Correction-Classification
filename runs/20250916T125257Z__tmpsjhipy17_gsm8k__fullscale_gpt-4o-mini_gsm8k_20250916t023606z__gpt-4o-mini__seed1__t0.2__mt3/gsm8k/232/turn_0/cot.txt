To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs.

1. **Identify the number of ants**: 
   According to the problem, there are 50 ants in the garden.

2. **Determine the number of bugs**: 
   The problem states that there are half as many bugs as there are ants. Since we know there are 50 ants, we can calculate the number of bugs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants}
   \]
   Substituting the number of ants:
   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs:
   \[
   \text{Total insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total insects} = 50 + 25 = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is \( \boxed{75} \).
