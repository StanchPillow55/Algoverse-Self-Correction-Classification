To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Birds**: Jeremy saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Calculating the Number of Birds Scared Away**: 
   - Jeremy scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 12 birds.
   - To find \( \frac{1}{3} \) of 12, we perform the calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]
   - So, 4 birds were scared away.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Birds**: 
   - After scaring away 4 birds, we need to find out how many birds are left in the backyard:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 8 birds remaining in the backyard.

4. **Adding More Birds**: 
   - A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the 8 fearless birds.
   - To find the total number of birds now in the backyard, we add the 20 new birds to the 8 remaining birds:
     \[
     8 + 20 = 28
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   - The total number of birds now in the backyard is \( \boxed{28} \).
