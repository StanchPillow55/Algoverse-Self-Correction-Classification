To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. First, we find out how long it takes her to sauté one shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook 1 shrimp} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes/shrimp}
\]

Now, we calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook 90 shrimp} = 90 \text{ shrimp} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes/shrimp} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp

Now, we add the time taken to peel and the time taken to cook:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
