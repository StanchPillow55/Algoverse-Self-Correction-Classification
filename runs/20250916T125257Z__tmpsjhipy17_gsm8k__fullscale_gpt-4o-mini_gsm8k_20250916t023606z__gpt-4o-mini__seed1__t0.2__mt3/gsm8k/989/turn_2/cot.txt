To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cooking the shrimp separately, and then sum those times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. First, we find out how long it takes her to sauté 1 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to sauté 1 shrimp} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ shrimp}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp}
\]

Now, we calculate the time to sauté 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to sauté 90 shrimp} = 90 \text{ shrimp} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ minutes per shrimp} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time

Now we add the time to peel and the time to sauté:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
