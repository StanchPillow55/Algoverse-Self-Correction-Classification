To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**: 
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in all stalls initially is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of new cows Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows.

3. **Calculate the total number of cows after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows**:
   - The total number of cows after adding the new cows is:
     \[
     \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ initial cows} + 40 \text{ new cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
     \]

4. **Determine how many stalls there are**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.

5. **Calculate how many cows are placed in each stall**:
   - The total number of cows (240) will be divided equally among the 20 stalls. Therefore, the number of cows in each stall is:
     \[
     \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of cows in 8 stalls**:
   - To find the total number of cows in 8 stalls, we multiply the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls:
     \[
     \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
     \]

Finally, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]
