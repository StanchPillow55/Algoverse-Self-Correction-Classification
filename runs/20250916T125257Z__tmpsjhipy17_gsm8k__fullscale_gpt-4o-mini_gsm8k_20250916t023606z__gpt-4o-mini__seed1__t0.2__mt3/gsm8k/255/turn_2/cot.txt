To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cows in the stalls**:
   - There are 10 stalls, and each stall has 20 cows.
   - Total number of cows in all stalls = Number of stalls Ã— Cows per stall
   \[
   \text{Total cows} = 10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows/stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
   \]

2. **Add the new cows that Mr. Sylas buys**:
   - Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   - Total number of cows after the purchase = Initial cows + New cows
   \[
   \text{Total cows after purchase} = 200 \text{ cows} + 40 \text{ cows} = 240 \text{ cows}
   \]

3. **Distribute the new cows equally among the stalls**:
   - There are 20 stalls in total.
   - To find out how many cows will be in each stall after distributing the new cows, we divide the total number of cows by the number of stalls.
   \[
   \text{Cows per stall} = \frac{\text{Total cows}}{\text{Number of stalls}} = \frac{240 \text{ cows}}{20 \text{ stalls}} = 12 \text{ cows/stall}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls**:
   - Since each stall now has 12 cows, we can find the total number of cows in 8 stalls by multiplying the number of cows per stall by the number of stalls we are considering.
   \[
   \text{Cows in 8 stalls} = 12 \text{ cows/stall} \times 8 \text{ stalls} = 96 \text{ cows}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of cows in 8 of the stalls is:
   \[
   \boxed{96}
   \]
