To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten sub sandwiches = 10
   - Therefore, Sidney ordered: 
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7 \text{ sub sandwiches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in Sidney's original order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in 7 sub sandwiches is:
   \[
   7 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sub} = 28 \text{ meatballs}
   \]

3. **Determine how many sub sandwiches Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.

4. **Calculate how many sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some:**
   - Initially, Sidney had 7 sub sandwiches. After Mark ate 4, the remaining number of sub sandwiches is:
   \[
   7 - 4 = 3 \text{ sub sandwiches}
   \]

5. **Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches:**
   - Now, Sidney orders an additional 3 sub sandwiches. Therefore, the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now is:
   \[
   3 \text{ remaining} + 3 \text{ new} = 6 \text{ sub sandwiches}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - Each of the 6 sub sandwiches contains 4 meatballs. Thus, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches is:
   \[
   6 \text{ sub sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sub} = 24 \text{ meatballs}
   \]

Finally, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
