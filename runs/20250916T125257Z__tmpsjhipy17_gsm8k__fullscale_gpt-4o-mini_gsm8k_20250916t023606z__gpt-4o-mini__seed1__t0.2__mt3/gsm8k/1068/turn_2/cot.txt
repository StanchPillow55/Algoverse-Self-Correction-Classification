To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered initially:**
   - Sidney ordered "3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches."
   - First, calculate ten minus three:
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7
     \]
   - Therefore, Sidney ordered **7 meatball sub sandwiches**.

2. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in Sidney's initial order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains **4 meatballs**.
   - To find the total number of meatballs in 7 sandwiches, we multiply:
     \[
     7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many sandwiches Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate **4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches**.

4. **Calculate how many sandwiches Sidney has left after Mark ate some:**
   - Initially, Sidney had 7 sandwiches, and Mark ate 4 of them:
     \[
     7 - 4 = 3 \text{ sandwiches remaining}
     \]

5. **Sidney ordered more sandwiches:**
   - Sidney ordered **another 3 sub sandwiches**.
   - Now, we need to calculate the total number of sandwiches Sidney has after ordering more:
     \[
     3 \text{ remaining sandwiches} + 3 \text{ new sandwiches} = 6 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches:**
   - Each of the 6 sandwiches contains 4 meatballs:
     \[
     6 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sandwich} = 24 \text{ meatballs}
     \]

Finally, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is **24**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
