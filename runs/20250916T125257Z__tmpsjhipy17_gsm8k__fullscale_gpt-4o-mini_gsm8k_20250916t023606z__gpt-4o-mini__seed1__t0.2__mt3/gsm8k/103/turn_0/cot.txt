To determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: The fog bank covers 3 miles of the city in 10 minutes. We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire width of the city, which is 42 miles.

2. **Calculate the number of segments**: Since the fog covers 3 miles at a time, we need to find out how many 3-mile segments fit into the total distance of 42 miles.

   \[
   \text{Number of segments} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance covered per segment}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time**: Since it takes 10 minutes to cover each 3-mile segment, we can find the total time by multiplying the number of segments by the time taken for each segment.

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of segments} \times \text{Time per segment} = 14 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 140 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, it will take a total of 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 140 \text{ minutes}
\]
