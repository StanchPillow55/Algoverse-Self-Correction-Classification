To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across.

1. **Understanding the Rate of Coverage**:
   The problem states that the fog bank covers 3 miles of the city in 10 minutes. This gives us a rate of coverage.

   \[
   \text{Rate of coverage} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
   \]

2. **Calculating the Total Time to Cover 42 Miles**:
   We need to find out how long it will take to cover the entire 42 miles. We can use the rate of coverage to find the total time.

   To find the time \( t \) in minutes to cover 42 miles, we can use the formula:

   \[
   t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   t = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}}
   \]

3. **Performing the Calculation**:
   Now we perform the division:

   \[
   t = 42 \div 0.3
   \]

   To make the division easier, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

   \[
   t = \frac{42 \times 10}{0.3 \times 10} = \frac{420}{3}
   \]

   Now, we divide 420 by 3:

   \[
   420 \div 3 = 140
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 140 \text{ minutes}
\]
