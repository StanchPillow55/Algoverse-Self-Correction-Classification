To determine the total cost of each uniform, we will break down the costs of each component: the hat, the jacket, and the pants.

1. **Cost of the Hat**:
   The cost of the hat is given as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Hat} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket**:
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of Hat} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the Pants**:
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and the jacket. First, we need to find the average of the two costs:
   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket}}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the pants is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pants} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the Uniform**:
   Now, we can find the total cost of the uniform by adding the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket} + \text{Cost of Pants}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:
\[
\boxed{150} \text{ dollars}
\]
