To find out how much Jen will earn by selling her root crops, we need to calculate the total earnings from each type of crop and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate earnings from yams:**
   - Jen has 6 yams.
   - Each yam sells for $1.50.
   - Total earnings from yams = Number of yams × Price per yam
   \[
   \text{Total from yams} = 6 \times 1.50 = 9.00
   \]

2. **Calculate earnings from sweet potatoes:**
   - Jen has 10 sweet potatoes.
   - Each sweet potato sells for $2.00.
   - Total earnings from sweet potatoes = Number of sweet potatoes × Price per sweet potato
   \[
   \text{Total from sweet potatoes} = 10 \times 2.00 = 20.00
   \]

3. **Calculate earnings from carrots:**
   - Jen has 4 carrots.
   - Each carrot sells for $1.25.
   - Total earnings from carrots = Number of carrots × Price per carrot
   \[
   \text{Total from carrots} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5.00
   \]

4. **Sum the total earnings from all crops:**
   - Total earnings = Total from yams + Total from sweet potatoes + Total from carrots
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 9.00 + 20.00 + 5.00 = 34.00
   \]

Thus, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn a total of **$34.00**.

Final answer: **$34.00**
