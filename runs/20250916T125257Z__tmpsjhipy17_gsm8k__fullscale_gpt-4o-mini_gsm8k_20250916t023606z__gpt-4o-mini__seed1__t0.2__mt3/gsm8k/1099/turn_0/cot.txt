To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the biggest waterslide

The length of the biggest waterslide is 300 feet, and the speed at which people slide down is 60 feet per minute. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the biggest waterslide:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide

The length of the second biggest waterslide is 240 feet, and the speed at which people slide down is 80 feet per minute. Using the same formula for time:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} 
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the difference in time

Now that we have the time for both slides, we can find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It takes **2 minutes longer** to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.
