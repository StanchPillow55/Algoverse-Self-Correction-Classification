To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all the fees and tip, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the delivery vendor's fee**: The vendor charges a 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00.
   \[
   \text{Vendor's fee} = 25\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = 10.00
   \]

2. **Add the delivery fee**: The delivery vendor also charges a flat delivery fee of $3.00.
   \[
   \text{Total fees} = \text{Vendor's fee} + \text{Delivery fee} = 10.00 + 3.00 = 13.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost before the tip**: To find the total cost before adding the tip, we add the original bill to the total fees.
   \[
   \text{Total cost before tip} = \text{Original bill} + \text{Total fees} = 40.00 + 13.00 = 53.00
   \]

4. **Add the tip**: Stephen also added a tip of $4.00.
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Total cost before tip} + \text{Tip} = 53.00 + 4.00 = 57.00
   \]

Thus, the final price of Stephen's groceries, including all fees and the tip, is:
\[
\boxed{57.00}
\]
