To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance**:
   - The total number of students in the dance class is 20.
   - 20% of the students enrolled in contemporary dance can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20\% \times 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining students after contemporary dance enrollment**:
   - After accounting for the students in contemporary dance, the number of remaining students is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance**:
   - 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 25\% \times 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of students remaining after jazz dance enrollment**:
   - After accounting for the students in jazz dance, the number of remaining students is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 16 - 4 = 12
     \]

5. **Determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance**:
   - The remaining students, who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance, must have enrolled in hip-hop dance. Thus, the number of students in hip-hop dance is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = 12
     \]

6. **Calculate the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance**:
   - To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Percentage in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Finally, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:
\[
\boxed{60\%}
\]
