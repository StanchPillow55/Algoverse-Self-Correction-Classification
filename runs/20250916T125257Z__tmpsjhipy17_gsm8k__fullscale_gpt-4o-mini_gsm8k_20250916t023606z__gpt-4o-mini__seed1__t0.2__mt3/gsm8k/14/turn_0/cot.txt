To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance**:
   - The total number of students in the dance class is 20.
   - 20% of these students are enrolled in contemporary dance.
   - To find the number of students in contemporary dance, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20\% \times 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining students after contemporary dance**:
   - After accounting for the students in contemporary dance, we subtract the number of students in contemporary dance from the total:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance**:
   - 25% of the remaining students (16) enrolled in jazz dance.
   - To find the number of students in jazz dance, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 25\% \times 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining students after jazz dance**:
   - Now we subtract the number of students in jazz dance from the remaining students:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 16 - 4 = 12
     \]

5. **Determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance**:
   - The remaining students (12) are all enrolled in hip-hop dance.

6. **Calculate the percentage of the entire class that is enrolled in hip-hop dance**:
   - We have 12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance out of a total of 20 students.
   - To find the percentage, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left(\frac{12}{20}\right) \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Finally, the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is:

\[
\boxed{60\%}
\]
