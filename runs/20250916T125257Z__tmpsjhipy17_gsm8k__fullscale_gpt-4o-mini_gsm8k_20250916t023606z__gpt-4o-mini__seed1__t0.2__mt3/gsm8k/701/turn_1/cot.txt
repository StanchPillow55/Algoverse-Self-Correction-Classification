To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the group.**
2. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people in the group

Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema. 

- Aiden: 1
- Friends with Aiden: 12
- Friends met at the cinema: 7

Total number of people = Aiden + Friends with Aiden + Friends met at the cinema
\[
\text{Total number of people} = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed

Each person has a seat that can hold:
- 1 person
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Now, we will calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for 20 people.

**Total drinks:**
\[
\text{Total drinks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Drinks per person} = 20 \times 2 = 40
\]

**Total snacks:**
\[
\text{Total snacks} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Snacks per person} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2.

**Total cost for drinks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for drinks} = \text{Total drinks} \times \text{Cost per drink} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

**Total cost for snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for snacks} = \text{Total snacks} \times \text{Cost per snack} = 60 \times 2 = 120
\]

**Total cost for drinks and snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for drinks} + \text{Total cost for snacks} = 80 + 120 = 200
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is \(\boxed{200}\) dollars.
