To determine how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the number of plants needed for one basket:**
   - Each basket requires 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.
   - Total plants per basket = 3 petunias + 2 sweet potato vines = 5 plants.

2. **Calculate the total number of plants for all 5 baskets:**
   - Total petunias for 5 baskets = 3 petunias/basket × 5 baskets = 15 petunias.
   - Total sweet potato vines for 5 baskets = 2 sweet potato vines/basket × 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the petunias:**
   - Cost per petunia = $3.00.
   - Total cost for petunias = 15 petunias × $3.00/petunia = $45.00.

4. **Calculate the total cost for the sweet potato vines:**
   - Cost per sweet potato vine = $2.50.
   - Total cost for sweet potato vines = 10 sweet potato vines × $2.50/vine = $25.00.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all plants:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for petunias + Total cost for sweet potato vines.
   - Total cost = $45.00 + $25.00 = $70.00.

Thus, Katherine will spend a total of **$70.00** filling all 5 hanging baskets.
