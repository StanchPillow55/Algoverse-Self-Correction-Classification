To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkout**: 24 guests elected for an early checkout. 
   - After these guests check out, the number of guests remaining is:
   \[
   100 - 24 = 76 \text{ guests}
   \]

3. **Late Checkout**: 15 guests elected for a late checkout. 
   - These guests will also leave the hotel, so we subtract them from the current number of guests:
   \[
   76 - 15 = 61 \text{ guests}
   \]

4. **Check-ins in the Afternoon**: The problem states that twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests checking in is:
   \[
   2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests}
   \]
   - We add these guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
   \]

5. **Check-ins After Dinner**: After dinner, 7 more guests checked in. We add these guests to the current total:
   \[
   91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
   \]

Now, we have calculated the total number of guests currently in the hotel after all checkouts and check-ins.

**Final Answer**: The hotel now has **98 guests**.
