To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of streaming services

1. **Cost of Netflix**: 
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus**: 
   - The normal cost for Hulu is $10 per month.
   - The normal cost for Disney Plus is $10 per month.
   - Together, the normal cost for both services would be:
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Bundling Discount**: 
   - Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus.
   - To find the amount saved from the bundling, we calculate 20% of $20:
     \[
     0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost after the discount is:
     \[
     20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Streaming Services**: 
   - Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the savings from cancelling cable

1. **Cost of Cable Package**: 
   - Tim's cable package costs $60 per month.

2. **Calculate the Savings**: 
   - To find out how much Tim saves by switching to streaming services, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable package:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer

Tim saves **$34** by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.
