To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total monthly cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Cost of Streaming Services:**
   - Netflix: $10 per month
   - Hulu: $10 per month
   - Disney Plus: $10 per month

   Normally, the total cost without bundling would be:
   \[
   \text{Total without bundling} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Hulu} + \text{Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Bundling Discount:**
   Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus. The cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together is:
   \[
   \text{Hulu + Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   The discount on this amount is:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the bundled cost is:
   \[
   \text{Bundled cost} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost of Streaming Services:**
   Now, we add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost:
   \[
   \text{Total streaming cost} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Bundled cost} = 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Cable Subscription:**
   Tim's cable subscription costs $60 per month.

5. **Calculating Savings:**
   To find out how much Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription, we subtract the total cost of streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cable cost} - \text{Total streaming cost} = 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Tim saves **$34** by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

**Final Answer: $34**
