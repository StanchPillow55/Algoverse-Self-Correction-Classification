To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cards the boy's brother has and then find the total number of cards they both have together.

1. **Determine the number of cards the boy has:**
   The problem states that the boy has 5 cards.

   \[
   \text{Number of cards the boy has} = 5
   \]

2. **Determine the number of cards the boy's brother has:**
   The problem states that the boy's brother has 3 fewer cards than the boy. To find out how many cards the brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has.

   \[
   \text{Number of cards the brother has} = \text{Number of cards the boy has} - 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of cards the brother has} = 5 - 3 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards they have together:**
   Now that we know how many cards each of them has, we can find the total by adding the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = \text{Number of cards the boy has} + \text{Number of cards the brother has}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 5 + 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of cards they have together is 

   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]
