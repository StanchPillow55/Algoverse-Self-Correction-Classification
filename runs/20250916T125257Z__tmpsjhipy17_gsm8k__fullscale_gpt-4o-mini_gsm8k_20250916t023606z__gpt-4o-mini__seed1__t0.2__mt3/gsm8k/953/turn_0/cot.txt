To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Normal Sleep Schedule**: 
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - This means she typically sleeps for 8 hours.

2. **Sleepwalking Incident**:
   - On the day in question, Kim sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - We need to calculate the duration of her sleepwalking:
     \[
     2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Waking Up Early**:
   - Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom.
   - Normally, she wakes up at 6:00 a.m., so waking up 5 minutes earlier means she woke up at:
     \[
     6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
     \]

4. **Total Sleep Duration**:
   - Now, we need to calculate the total time she was in bed that night.
   - She went to sleep at 10:00 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The total time from 10:00 p.m. to 5:55 a.m. is:
     \[
     5:55 \text{ a.m.} - 10:00 \text{ p.m.}
     \]
   - To calculate this, we can break it down:
     - From 10:00 p.m. to midnight (12:00 a.m.) is 2 hours.
     - From midnight to 5:55 a.m. is 5 hours and 55 minutes.
     - Therefore, the total time in bed is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes} = 7 \text{ hours and } 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert Total Sleep Time to Minutes**:
   - Now, we convert 7 hours and 55 minutes into minutes:
     \[
     7 \text{ hours} = 7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     55 \text{ minutes} = 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sleep time} = 420 + 55 = 475 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Subtract Sleepwalking Time**:
   - During the time she was sleepwalking (23 minutes), she was not fully asleep in bed.
   - Therefore, we need to subtract the sleepwalking time from the total sleep time:
     \[
     475 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of time Kim actually slept on her bed that day is:

\[
\boxed{452} \text{ minutes}
\]
