To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of sacks given away**: Goldy gave away 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. We need to find the total number of sacks she gave away.

   \[
   \text{Total sacks given away} = \text{sacks to cousin} + \text{sacks to brother} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ sacks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the rice given away**: Each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. We need to find the total weight of the 7 sacks that Goldy gave away.

   \[
   \text{Weight of rice given away} = \text{Total sacks given away} \times \text{weight per sack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of rice given away} = 7 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack} = 175 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **State the final answer**: Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{175 \text{ kg}}
\]
