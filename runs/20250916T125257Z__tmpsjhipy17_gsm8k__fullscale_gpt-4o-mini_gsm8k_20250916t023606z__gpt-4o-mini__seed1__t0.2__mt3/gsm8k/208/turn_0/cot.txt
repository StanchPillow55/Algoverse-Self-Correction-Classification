To find out how many cakes Rose bought over the three days, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Cakes bought on Monday**:
   - Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Monday} = 4
   \]

2. **Cakes bought on Tuesday**:
   - On Tuesday, Rose bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. 
   - Therefore, the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 3 \times \text{Cakes on Monday} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Cakes bought on Wednesday**:
   - On Wednesday, Rose bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
   - Thus, the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday is:
   \[
   \text{Cakes on Wednesday} = 5 \times \text{Cakes on Tuesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

4. **Total cakes bought**:
   - Now, we will sum the number of cakes bought over the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total cakes} = \text{Cakes on Monday} + \text{Cakes on Tuesday} + \text{Cakes on Wednesday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cakes} = 4 + 12 + 60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cakes} = 76
   \]

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \( \boxed{76} \).
