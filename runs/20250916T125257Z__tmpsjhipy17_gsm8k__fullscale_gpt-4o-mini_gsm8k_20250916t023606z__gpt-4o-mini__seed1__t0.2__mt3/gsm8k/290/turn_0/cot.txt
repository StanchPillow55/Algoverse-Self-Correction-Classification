To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has**:
   - Ali has won 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   \[
   \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of medals won by Ali and Izzy**:
   - We add the number of medals Ali has to the number of medals Izzy has.
   \[
   \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting**:
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together.
   \[
   \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of medals that have been given out for counting is 390.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{390}
\]
