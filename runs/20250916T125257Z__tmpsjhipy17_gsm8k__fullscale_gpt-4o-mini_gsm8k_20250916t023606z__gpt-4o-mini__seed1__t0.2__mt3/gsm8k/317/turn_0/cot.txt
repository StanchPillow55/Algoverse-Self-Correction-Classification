To determine the cost of filling the pool, we first need to calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given the dimensions of the pool:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} \times 5 \, \text{ft}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. First, calculate the area of the base (length Ã— width):
   \[
   6 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 24 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]

2. Next, multiply the area of the base by the depth to find the volume:
   \[
   24 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 5 \, \text{ft} = 120 \, \text{ft}^3
   \]

Now that we have the volume of the pool, we can calculate the cost to fill it. The cost per cubic foot is given as $0.10. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) to fill the pool can be calculated using the formula:

\[
C = \text{Volume} \times \text{Cost per cubic foot}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
C = 120 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/ft}^3
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
C = 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Thus, the total cost to fill the pool is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\] 

Final answer: It costs $12 to fill the pool.
