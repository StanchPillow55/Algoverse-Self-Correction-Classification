To find out how much Winston spent on fruit, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of fruit he picked and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of peaches:**
   - Price per pound of peaches = $2.00
   - Weight of peaches picked = 6 pounds
   - Total cost for peaches = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peaches} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of plums:**
   - Price per pound of plums = $1.00
   - Weight of plums picked = 8 pounds
   - Total cost for plums = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for plums} = 1.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 8 \, \text{pounds} = 8.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of apricots:**
   - Price per pound of apricots = $3.00
   - Weight of apricots picked = 6 pounds
   - Total cost for apricots = Price per pound × Weight
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apricots} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 6 \, \text{pounds} = 18.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Sum the total costs:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for peaches + Total cost for plums + Total cost for apricots
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12.00 \, \text{dollars} + 8.00 \, \text{dollars} + 18.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 38.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Winston spent a total of **$38.00** on fruit.

Final answer: **$38.00**
