To solve the problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question carefully. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: 
   Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We denote this starting value as \( S = 20 \).

2. **Calculate half of the number**: 
   The problem states that we need to add half of the number to the starting value. Since we are not given a specific number, we will denote the number as \( N \). Therefore, half of the number is \( \frac{N}{2} \).

3. **Add the starting value and half the number**: 
   We need to calculate:
   \[
   S + \frac{N}{2} = 20 + \frac{N}{2}
   \]

4. **Divide the result by 5**: 
   Next, we take the result from the previous step and divide it by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

5. **Multiply by the starting value minus 12**: 
   We need to multiply the result from the previous step by \( S - 12 \):
   \[
   S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   So, we multiply:
   \[
   \left(\frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}\right) \times 8
   \]

6. **Combine the calculations**: 
   Now we can express the final value \( F \) of the number train:
   \[
   F = \left(\frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}\right) \times 8
   \]

7. **Simplify the expression**: 
   We can simplify this expression step by step:
   \[
   F = \frac{8(20 + \frac{N}{2})}{5}
   \]
   Distributing the 8:
   \[
   F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

8. **Final expression**: 
   The final value of the number train, expressed in terms of \( N \), is:
   \[
   F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( N \), we cannot compute a numerical final answer without knowing \( N \). However, we have derived the formula for the final value of the number train based on the starting value and the number \( N \).

If you have a specific value for \( N \), please provide it, and we can calculate the final value. Otherwise, the final answer in terms of \( N \) is:
\[
F = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]
