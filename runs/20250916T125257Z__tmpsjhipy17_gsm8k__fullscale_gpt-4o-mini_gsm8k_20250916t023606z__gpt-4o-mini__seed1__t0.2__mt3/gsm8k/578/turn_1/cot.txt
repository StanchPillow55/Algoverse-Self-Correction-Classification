To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: The problem states that Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. We will denote this starting value as \( S = 20 \).

2. **Define the number**: Let's denote the number in the number train as \( N \). The problem does not specify what \( N \) is, so we will keep it as a variable for now.

3. **Calculate half of the number**: Half of the number \( N \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{N}{2}
   \]

4. **Add the starting value to half the number**: We need to add the starting value \( S \) to half of the number \( N \):
   \[
   S + \frac{N}{2} = 20 + \frac{N}{2}
   \]

5. **Divide the result by 5**: Now we will divide the result from step 4 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

6. **Multiply by the starting value minus 12**: Next, we need to calculate the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   S - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   Now we multiply the result from step 5 by 8:
   \[
   8 \cdot \frac{20 + \frac{N}{2}}{5}
   \]

7. **Simplify the expression**: We can simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   = \frac{8(20 + \frac{N}{2})}{5}
   \]
   Distributing the 8:
   \[
   = \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

8. **Final expression**: The final value of the number train can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{160 + 4N}{5}
   \]

Since the problem does not provide a specific value for \( N \), we cannot compute a numerical final answer without knowing \( N \). However, the expression we derived represents the final value of the number train in terms of \( N \).

If we assume \( N \) is a specific number, we can substitute that value into our final expression to get a numerical answer. 

For example, if \( N = 10 \):
\[
\frac{160 + 4(10)}{5} = \frac{160 + 40}{5} = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

But since \( N \) is not specified in the problem, we conclude that the final value of the number train is:
\[
\frac{160 + 4N}{5}
\]

**Final Answer**: The final value of the number train is \( \frac{160 + 4N}{5} \), where \( N \) is the unspecified number.
