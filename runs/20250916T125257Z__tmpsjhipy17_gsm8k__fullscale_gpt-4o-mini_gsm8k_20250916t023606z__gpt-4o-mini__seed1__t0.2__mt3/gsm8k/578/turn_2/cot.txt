To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: The starting value given by Diane is 20.

2. **Define the number**: Let's denote the number as \( x \). The problem states that we will use the starting value (20) plus half of the number \( x \).

3. **Calculate half of the number**: Half of \( x \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

4. **Add the starting value to half the number**: We now add the starting value (20) to half of the number:
   \[
   20 + \frac{x}{2}
   \]

5. **Divide the result by 5**: Next, we divide the result from step 4 by 5:
   \[
   \frac{20 + \frac{x}{2}}{5}
   \]

6. **Simplify the expression**: To simplify the expression, we can distribute the division:
   \[
   \frac{20}{5} + \frac{\frac{x}{2}}{5} = 4 + \frac{x}{10}
   \]

7. **Calculate the starting value minus 12**: Now, we need to calculate the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   20 - 12 = 8
   \]

8. **Multiply the result from step 6 by the result from step 7**: We now multiply the two results:
   \[
   \left(4 + \frac{x}{10}\right) \times 8
   \]

9. **Distribute the multiplication**:
   \[
   4 \times 8 + \frac{x}{10} \times 8 = 32 + \frac{8x}{10}
   \]
   Simplifying \( \frac{8x}{10} \) gives us:
   \[
   \frac{8x}{10} = \frac{4x}{5}
   \]

10. **Combine the results**: Thus, the final expression for the value of the number train is:
    \[
    32 + \frac{4x}{5}
    \]

Now, since the problem does not specify a particular value for \( x \), we can express the final value of the number train in terms of \( x \):
\[
\text{Final Value} = 32 + \frac{4x}{5}
\]

If we were to assume a specific value for \( x \), we could substitute it into this expression to find a numerical answer. However, without a specific value for \( x \), the final answer remains in this form.

**Final Answer**: The final value of the number train is \( 32 + \frac{4x}{5} \).
