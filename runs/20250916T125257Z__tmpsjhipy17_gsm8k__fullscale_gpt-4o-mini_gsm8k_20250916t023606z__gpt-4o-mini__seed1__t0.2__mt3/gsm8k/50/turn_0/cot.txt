To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can find the number of dozens by dividing the total number of eggs by 12:

\[
\text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{252}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{252}{12} = 21 \text{ dozens}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily income from selling eggs.

Lloyd sells each dozen of eggs for $2. To find out how much he makes in a day from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen:

\[
\text{Daily income} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Price per dozen} = 21 \times 2
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
21 \times 2 = 42 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weekly income from selling eggs.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the weekly income by multiplying the daily income by 7:

\[
\text{Weekly income} = \text{Daily income} \times 7 = 42 \times 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
42 \times 7 = 294 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Lloyd makes **$294** on eggs per week.
