To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per week**:
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 = 1764 \, \text{eggs}
     \]

2. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens**:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:
     \[
     \text{Total dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{1764 \, \text{eggs}}{12}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total dozens} = 147 \, \text{dozens}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs**:
   - Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the eggs in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total dozens} \times \text{Price per dozen} = 147 \, \text{dozens} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/dozen}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 294 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Lloyd makes a total of $294 from selling eggs per week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{294}
\]
