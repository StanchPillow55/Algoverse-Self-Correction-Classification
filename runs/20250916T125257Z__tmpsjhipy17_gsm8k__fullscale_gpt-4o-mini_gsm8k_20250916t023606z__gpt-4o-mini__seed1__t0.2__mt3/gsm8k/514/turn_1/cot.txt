To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - We are also told that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First**:
   - We can substitute \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Find the Cost of the House**:
   - Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \).

To summarize, we defined the variables, set up the equations based on the problem's conditions, substituted to find the cost of the lot, and then calculated the cost of the house. The final answer is that the house costs $90,000.
