To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - The problem also states that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation. So, we replace \( H \) in the first equation:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - To find \( L \), divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Find \( H \)**:
   - Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( H = 90,000 \).

Thus, the final answer is that the house cost **$90,000**.
