To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Games**: 
   - Steve starts with 5 games given to him by his parents.

2. **Year 1**:
   - In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 1} = 1 \text{ game/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ games}
     \]
   - Additionally, he receives 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 1 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 1} = 5 \text{ (initial)} + 12 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 22 \text{ games}
     \]

3. **Year 2**:
   - In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month.
   - Again, there are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 2} = 2 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ games}
     \]
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 2 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 2} = 22 \text{ (from Year 1)} + 24 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 51 \text{ games}
     \]

4. **Year 3**:
   - In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month.
   - Again, there are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     \text{Games bought in Year 3} = 4 \text{ games/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 48 \text{ games}
     \]
   - He receives another 5 games for Christmas.
   - Therefore, the total number of games after Year 3 is:
     \[
     \text{Total games after Year 3} = 51 \text{ (from Year 2)} + 48 \text{ (bought)} + 5 \text{ (Christmas)} = 104 \text{ games}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - After calculating all the games Steve has after 3 years, we find that:
     \[
     \text{Total games after 3 years} = 104
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
