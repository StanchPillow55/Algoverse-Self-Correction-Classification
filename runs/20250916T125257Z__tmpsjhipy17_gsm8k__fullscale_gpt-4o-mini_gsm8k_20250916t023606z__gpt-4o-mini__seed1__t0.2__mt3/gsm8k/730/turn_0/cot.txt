To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of gum Parker chews in 30 days.**
   - Parker chews 4 pieces of gum each day.
   - Therefore, over 30 days, the total number of pieces of gum he chews is:
     \[
     \text{Total pieces of gum} = \text{pieces per day} \times \text{number of days} = 4 \, \text{pieces/day} \times 30 \, \text{days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pieces of gum} = 120 \, \text{pieces}
     \]

2. **Determine how many packs of gum are needed for 120 pieces.**
   - Each pack of gum contains 15 pieces.
   - To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per pack:
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total pieces of gum}}{\text{pieces per pack}} = \frac{120 \, \text{pieces}}{15 \, \text{pieces/pack}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = 8
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
