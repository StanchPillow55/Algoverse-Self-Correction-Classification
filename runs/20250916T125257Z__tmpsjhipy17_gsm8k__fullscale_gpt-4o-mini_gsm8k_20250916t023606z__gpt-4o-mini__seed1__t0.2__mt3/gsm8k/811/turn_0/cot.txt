To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week. 

1. **Calculate Total Earnings from Climbing**:
   Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we can set up the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Charge per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

2. **Perform the Division**:
   To divide 105 by 0.25, we can convert 0.25 into a fraction:

   \[
   0.25 = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:

   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \times 4
   \]

   Now, we calculate:

   \[
   105 \times 4 = 420
   \]

   So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

3. **Calculate Average Branches Climbed Per Day**:
   There are 7 days in a week. To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division**:
   Now we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

Thus, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

**Final Answer**: Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.
