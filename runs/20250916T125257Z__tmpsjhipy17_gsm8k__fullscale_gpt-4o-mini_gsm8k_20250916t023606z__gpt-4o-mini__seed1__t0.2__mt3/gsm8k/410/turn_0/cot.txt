To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and then subtract that from the amount of money she started with.

1. **Calculate the cost of the taffy:**
   - The sale is "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, so it costs:
     \[
     \text{Cost of second pound} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.50
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of taffy} = 3 + 1.50 = 4.50
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the mixed bag of seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Calculate the cost of the magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets. Therefore, the total cost for the magnets is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of magnets} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Now we add up all the costs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of taffy} + \text{Cost of seashells} + \text{Cost of magnets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00
     \]

5. **Calculate how much money Sally has left:**
   - Sally started with $10. We subtract the total cost from this amount:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = 10 - 7.00 = 3.00
     \]

Thus, after all her purchases, Sally has **$3.00** left.

Final answer: **$3.00**
