To determine how many classes Manny can miss before his parents decide not to sign him up again, we need to analyze the cost per class based on the number of classes he attends.

1. **Total Cost of Classes**: Manny signed up for Karate classes for a total of $60.

2. **Total Number of Classes**: There are 10 classes in total.

3. **Cost Per Class Calculation**: 
   - If Manny attends all 10 classes, the cost per class would be:
     \[
     \text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Total Number of Classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
     \]
   - This means that if he attends all classes, he pays $6 per class, which is below the $10 threshold set by his parents.

4. **Understanding the Threshold**: Manny's parents have stated that if the cost per class exceeds $10, they will not sign him up again. Therefore, we need to find out how many classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

5. **Let \( x \) be the number of classes Manny attends**. The number of classes he misses will then be \( 10 - x \).

6. **New Cost Per Class Calculation**: If Manny attends \( x \) classes, the cost per class becomes:
   \[
   \text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{x}
   \]

7. **Setting Up the Inequality**: We need to ensure that the cost per class does not exceed $10:
   \[
   \frac{60}{x} \leq 10
   \]

8. **Solving the Inequality**:
   - Multiply both sides by \( x \) (assuming \( x > 0 \)):
     \[
     60 \leq 10x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     6 \leq x
     \]
   - This means Manny must attend at least 6 classes.

9. **Calculating Missed Classes**: Since there are 10 classes in total, the number of classes Manny can miss is:
   \[
   \text{Classes missed} = 10 - x
   \]
   - If \( x \) is at least 6, then:
     \[
     \text{Classes missed} = 10 - 6 = 4
     \]

10. **Conclusion**: Manny can miss up to 4 classes while still keeping the cost per class at or below $10.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
