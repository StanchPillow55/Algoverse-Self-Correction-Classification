To solve the problem, we need to understand the trading system at Ralph's record store. The key points are:

1. People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.
2. 5 people come in and leave with a total of 7 new records.

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since the trading system allows for 2 old records to be exchanged for 1 new record, we can express the number of new records obtained from the old records as follows:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{\text{Number of old records}}{2}
\]

Given that the total number of new records obtained is 7, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]
\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

To verify, we can check how many new records they would receive from 14 old records:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
