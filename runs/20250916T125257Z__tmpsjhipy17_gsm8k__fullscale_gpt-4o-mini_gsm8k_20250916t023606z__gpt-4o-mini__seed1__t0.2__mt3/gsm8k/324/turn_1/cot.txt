To solve the problem, we need to determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, given that they traded 2 old records for 1 new record and left with a total of 7 new records.

1. **Understanding the trade ratio**: Each person can trade 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record received, 2 old records must be given.

2. **Calculating the total number of old records needed for the new records**: Since the 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the total number of old records they must have traded in to receive those new records.

   The formula to find the number of old records needed is:
   \[
   \text{Old records needed} = \text{New records} \times 2
   \]
   Substituting the number of new records:
   \[
   \text{Old records needed} = 7 \times 2 = 14
   \]

3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

Final answer: **14 old records**.
