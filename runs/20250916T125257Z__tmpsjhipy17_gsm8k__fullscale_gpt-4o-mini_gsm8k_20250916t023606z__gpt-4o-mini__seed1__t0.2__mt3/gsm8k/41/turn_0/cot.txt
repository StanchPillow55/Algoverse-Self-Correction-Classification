To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone and how far she can stand outside the dragon's reach while still being able to hit the dragon.

1. **Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin without the gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.

2. **Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone:**
   - When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than she can without it.
   - Therefore, the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the dragon's reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire and has a reach of 1000 feet.

4. **Calculate how far outside the dragon's reach Polly can stand:**
   - Since the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet, we need to find how far Polly can stand outside of this distance while still being able to hit the dragon.
   - If Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, she can stand at a distance of:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - This means Polly can stand 200 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit the dragon.

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the final answer is that Polly can stand **200 feet** outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.
