To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning costs.

1. **Calculate the cost for blouses:**
   - Number of blouses: 5
   - Cost per blouse: $5.00
   - Total cost for blouses = Number of blouses × Cost per blouse
   \[
   \text{Total cost for blouses} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for pants:**
   - Number of pants: 2
   - Cost per pair of pants: $8.00
   - Total cost for pants = Number of pants × Cost per pair of pants
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pants} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost for skirts:**
   - Number of skirts: 1
   - Cost per skirt: $6.00
   - Total cost for skirts = Number of skirts × Cost per skirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for skirts} = 1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   - Total weekly cost = Total cost for blouses + Total cost for pants + Total cost for skirts
   \[
   \text{Total weekly cost} = 25 + 16 + 6 = 47 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:**
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = Total weekly cost × Number of weeks
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 47 \times 5 = 235 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is **$235.00**.
