To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning cost and then multiply that by 5.

1. **Calculate the cost for each type of clothing:**
   - **Blouses:** 
     - Cost per blouse = $5.00
     - Number of blouses = 5
     - Total cost for blouses = 5 blouses × $5.00/blouse = $25.00

   - **Pants:** 
     - Cost per pair of pants = $8.00
     - Number of pants = 2
     - Total cost for pants = 2 pants × $8.00/pant = $16.00

   - **Skirt:** 
     - Cost per skirt = $6.00
     - Number of skirts = 1
     - Total cost for skirts = 1 skirt × $6.00/skirt = $6.00

2. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   - Total weekly cost = Total cost for blouses + Total cost for pants + Total cost for skirts
   - Total weekly cost = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00

3. **Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:**
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = Total weekly cost × 5 weeks
   - Total cost for 5 weeks = $47.00 × 5 = $235.00

Thus, Alicia spends a total of **$235.00** on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks. 

Final answer: **$235.00**
