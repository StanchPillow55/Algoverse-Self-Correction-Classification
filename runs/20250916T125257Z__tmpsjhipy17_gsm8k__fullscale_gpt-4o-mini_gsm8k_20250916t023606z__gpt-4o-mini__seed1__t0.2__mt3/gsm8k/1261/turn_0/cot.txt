To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning costs based on the number of items she sends to the cleaners and their respective prices.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly cost

Alicia's weekly drop-off includes:
- 5 blouses
- 2 pairs of pants
- 1 skirt

Now, we will calculate the cost for each type of clothing item:

1. **Cost for blouses**:
   - Price per blouse = $5.00
   - Number of blouses = 5
   - Total cost for blouses = \( 5 \text{ blouses} \times 5 \text{ dollars/blouse} = 25 \text{ dollars} \)

2. **Cost for pants**:
   - Price per pair of pants = $8.00
   - Number of pairs of pants = 2
   - Total cost for pants = \( 2 \text{ pants} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pant} = 16 \text{ dollars} \)

3. **Cost for skirt**:
   - Price per skirt = $6.00
   - Number of skirts = 1
   - Total cost for skirt = \( 1 \text{ skirt} \times 6 \text{ dollars/skirt} = 6 \text{ dollars} \)

### Step 2: Add up the weekly costs

Now, we will sum the costs of all the items to find the total weekly cost:

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Total cost for blouses} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for skirt}
\]

\[
\text{Total weekly cost} = 25 \text{ dollars} + 16 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 47 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks

To find out how much Alicia spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the total weekly cost by 5:

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 5
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 47 \text{ dollars/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 235 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Alicia spends a total of **$235.00** on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.
