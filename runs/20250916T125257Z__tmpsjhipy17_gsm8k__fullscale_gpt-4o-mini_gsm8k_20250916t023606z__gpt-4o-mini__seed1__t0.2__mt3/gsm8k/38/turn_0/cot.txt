To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total time he spends running each week and then use that to calculate his speed.

1. **Determine the total running time per week:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - On the other two days, he runs half as much time as he does on the first day. Therefore, the time he runs on the second and third days is:
     \[
     \text{Time on second day} = \text{Time on first day} \div 2 = 3 \text{ hours} \div 2 = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time on third day} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - Now, we can calculate the total running time for the week:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on first day} + \text{Time on second day} + \text{Time on third day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the total distance run per week:**
   - John runs a total of 60 miles a week.

3. **Calculate John's running speed:**
   - Speed is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, John's running speed is \( \boxed{10} \) miles per hour.
