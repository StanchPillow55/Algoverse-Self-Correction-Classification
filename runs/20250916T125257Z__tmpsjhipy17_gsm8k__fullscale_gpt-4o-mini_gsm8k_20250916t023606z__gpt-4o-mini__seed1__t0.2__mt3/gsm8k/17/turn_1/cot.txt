To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching job and her coaching job separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings from Teaching

Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from teaching} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate annual earnings from teaching:**
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from teaching} = 700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings from Coaching

Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week for 50 weeks a year.

1. **Calculate weekly earnings from coaching:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from coaching} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings from coaching} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate annual earnings from coaching:**
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from coaching} = \text{Weekly earnings} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual earnings from coaching} = 450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Annual Salary

Now, we sum the annual earnings from both teaching and coaching to find Jill's total annual salary.

\[
\text{Total annual salary} = \text{Annual earnings from teaching} + \text{Annual earnings from coaching}
\]
\[
\text{Total annual salary} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year} = 57,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Jill's total annual salary is **$57,500**.
