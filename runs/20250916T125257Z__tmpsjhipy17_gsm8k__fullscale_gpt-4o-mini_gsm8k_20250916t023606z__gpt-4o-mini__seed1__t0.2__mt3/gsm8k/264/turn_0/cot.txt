To solve the problem, we will first determine how much money each girl has based on the information provided.

1. **Carmen's Amount**:
   - Carmen has $100.

2. **Samantha's Amount**:
   - Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. 
   - Therefore, we calculate Samantha's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Samantha's amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125
     \]

3. **Daisy's Amount**:
   - Daisy has $50 more than Samantha.
   - We calculate Daisy's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daisy's amount} = \text{Samantha's amount} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175
     \]

4. **Total Amount Combined**:
   - Now, we will find the total amount of money that all three girls have combined. We add Carmen's, Samantha's, and Daisy's amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + \text{Samantha's amount} + \text{Daisy's amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 100 + 125 + 175
     \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - We perform the addition step-by-step:
     \[
     100 + 125 = 225
     \]
     \[
     225 + 175 = 400
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is **$400**.

Final answer: **$400**.
