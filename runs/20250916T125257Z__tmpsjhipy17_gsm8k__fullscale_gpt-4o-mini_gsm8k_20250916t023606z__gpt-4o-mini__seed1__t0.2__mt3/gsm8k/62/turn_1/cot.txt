To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the Pension Structure**:
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the Years of Service**:
   - Marcy works for 30 years, which means she has completed 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

3. **Calculating the Additional Pension**:
   - For each of the 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, she receives 5% of the pension value.
   - The pension value is $50,000.
   - The additional pension she earns for each of those 10 years is:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Since she earns this additional amount for 10 years, the total additional pension is:
     \[
     10 \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Annual Pension**:
   - The total annual pension Marcy will receive after 30 years of service is the base pension plus the additional pension:
     \[
     \text{Total Annual Pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
