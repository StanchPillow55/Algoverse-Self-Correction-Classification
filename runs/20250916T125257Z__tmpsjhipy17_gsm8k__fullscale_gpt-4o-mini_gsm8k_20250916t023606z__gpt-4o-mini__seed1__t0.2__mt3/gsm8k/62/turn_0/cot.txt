To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the pension structure**: 
   - Marcy's full pension after 40 years of service is $50,000 per year.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year of service beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the years of service**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years.
   - She becomes entitled to the 5% pension increment after 20 years. Therefore, the number of years she is entitled to this increment is:
     \[
     30 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total increment**:
   - For each of these 10 years, she receives an additional 5% of the pension value. 
   - The value of the pension is $50,000, so 5% of this value is:
     \[
     0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Over the 10 years, the total increment she receives is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating the total pension after 30 years**:
   - Marcy's annual pension after 30 years will be her base pension plus the total increment:
     \[
     50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years of service will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
