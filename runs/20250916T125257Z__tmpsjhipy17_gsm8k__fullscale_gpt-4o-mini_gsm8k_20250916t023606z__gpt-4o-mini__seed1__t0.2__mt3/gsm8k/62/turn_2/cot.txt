To solve the problem, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Pension Plan**: 
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 after working for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension for each year she continues to work.

2. **Calculating the Duration of Work**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years. 
   - She becomes entitled to the 5% increment after 20 years, so she will receive this increment for the additional 10 years (from year 20 to year 30).

3. **Calculating the 5% Increment**:
   - The value of the pension is $50,000.
   - The 5% of the pension is calculated as follows:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - This means that for each year after the 20th year, Marcy will receive an additional $2,500.

4. **Calculating Total Increment for 10 Years**:
   - Since Marcy is entitled to this increment for 10 years (from year 20 to year 30), we calculate the total increment:
     \[
     \text{Total Increment} = 2,500 \times 10 = 25,000
     \]

5. **Calculating the Total Annual Pension After 30 Years**:
   - Now, we add the total increment to the original pension amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Annual Pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]
