To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pets Cindy has:**
   - According to the problem, Cindy has 4 pets.

2. **Determine the number of pets Marcia has:**
   - The problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. 
   - Since Cindy has 4 pets, we can calculate Marcia's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Determine the number of pets Jan has:**
   - The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.
   - Since we found that Marcia has 6 pets, we can calculate Jan's pets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Now we need to find the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together. We will add the number of pets each person has:
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = \text{Jan's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Cindy's pets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = 18 + 6 + 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pets} = 28
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together is \( \boxed{28} \).
