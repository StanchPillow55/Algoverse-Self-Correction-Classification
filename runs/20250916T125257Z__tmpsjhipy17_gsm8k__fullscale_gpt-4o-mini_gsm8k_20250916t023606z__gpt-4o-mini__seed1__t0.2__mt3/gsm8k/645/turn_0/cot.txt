To solve the problem, we need to determine how much flour was in three bags before it was divided into portions.

1. **Understand the portions**: We know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, and each portion weighs 2 kilograms.

2. **Calculate the total weight of flour in one bag**:
   - Since there are 8 portions in one bag and each portion weighs 2 kilograms, we can calculate the total weight of flour in one bag as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of one bag} = \text{Number of portions} \times \text{Weight of each portion}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of one bag} = 8 \times 2 \text{ kg} = 16 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of flour in three bags**:
   - Now that we know the weight of one bag, we can find the total weight of flour in three bags:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of three bags} = \text{Weight of one bag} \times \text{Number of bags}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of three bags} = 16 \text{ kg} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
\[
\boxed{48} \text{ kg}
\]
