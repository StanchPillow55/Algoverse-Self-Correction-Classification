To solve the problem, we need to determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch over the course of 4 weekends, given their movie-watching schedule.

1. **Movies Watched on Saturday**: 
   Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies Watched on Sunday**: 
   They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Movies on Sunday} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies}
   \]

3. **Total Movies Watched in One Weekend**: 
   To find the total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday + Sunday), we add the movies watched on both days:
   \[
   \text{Total movies in one weekend} = \text{Movies on Saturday} + \text{Movies on Sunday} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies}
   \]

4. **Total Movies Watched in 4 Weeks**: 
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched over 4 weekends. We multiply the total movies watched in one weekend by the number of weekends:
   \[
   \text{Total movies in 4 weeks} = \text{Total movies in one weekend} \times 4 = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ movies}
   \]

Thus, the total number of movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
