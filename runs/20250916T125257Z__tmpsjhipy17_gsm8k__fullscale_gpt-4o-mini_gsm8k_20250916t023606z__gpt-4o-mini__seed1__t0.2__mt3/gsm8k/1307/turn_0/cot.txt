To determine how many screws James will have left over after assembling the tables, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for the tables**:
   - James is putting together 4 tables.
   - Each table has 4 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = \text{Number of tables} \times \text{Legs per table} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ legs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed**:
   - Each leg requires 2 screws.
   - To find the total number of screws needed, we multiply the total number of legs by the number of screws per leg:
     \[
     \text{Total screws needed} = \text{Total legs} \times \text{Screws per leg} = 16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ screws}
     \]

3. **Determine how many screws James has left over**:
   - James starts with 40 screws.
   - We need to subtract the total number of screws needed from the total screws he has:
     \[
     \text{Screws left over} = \text{Total screws} - \text{Total screws needed} = 40 - 32 = 8 \text{ screws}
     \]

Thus, after assembling the tables, James will have **8 screws left over**.

Final answer: **8 screws**.
