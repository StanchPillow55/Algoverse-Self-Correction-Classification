To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom. We will then divide that total by the number of days in the week (7 days).

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of animals

1. **Dogs**: 8
2. **Cats**: 5
3. **Birds**: 3
4. **Horses**: 12

Now, we will sum these numbers:

\[
\text{Total animals} = \text{Dogs} + \text{Cats} + \text{Birds} + \text{Horses}
\]
\[
\text{Total animals} = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:

- First, add the dogs and cats:
  \[
  8 + 5 = 13
  \]

- Next, add the birds:
  \[
  13 + 3 = 16
  \]

- Finally, add the horses:
  \[
  16 + 12 = 28
  \]

So, the total number of animals is **28**.

### Step 2: Divide the total number of animals by the number of days in the week

Now, we will divide the total number of animals (28) by the number of days in the week (7):

\[
\text{Animals per day} = \frac{\text{Total animals}}{\text{Number of days}}
\]
\[
\text{Animals per day} = \frac{28}{7}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Animals per day} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Melissa will groom **4 animals each day** of the week.
