To find the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Group of People**:
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: **50 people**.

2. **People Entering at 10:00**:
   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 50 + 40 = 90 \) people.

3. **Twice the Number of People Entering at 10:00**:
   - The number of people who entered at 10:00 was 40. Twice that number is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80
     \]
   - So, 80 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 90 + 80 = 170 \) people.

4. **Additional Group of People by Evening**:
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the first group (which was 50) entered the restaurant. This is calculated as:
     \[
     3 \times 50 = 150
     \]
   - So, 150 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Total so far: \( 170 + 150 = 320 \) people.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Now we have calculated the total number of people that entered the restaurant throughout the day:
     - Morning: 50
     - 10:00 Entry: 40
     - Twice the 10:00 Entry: 80
     - Evening Entry: 150
   - Adding these together gives us:
     \[
     50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320
     \]

Thus, the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day is **320**. 

Final answer: **320**.
