To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.**
2. **Determine how many boxes of oranges she gave away.**
3. **Calculate how many boxes of oranges she kept.**
4. **Find out how many oranges she kept.**
5. **Determine how many oranges she sold.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 12 \times 20 = 240 \text{ oranges}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes of oranges she gave away

Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Therefore, the total number of boxes she gave away is:

\[
\text{Total boxes given away} = 2 \text{ (to mom)} + 2 \text{ (to sister)} = 4 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many boxes of oranges she kept

To find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept, we subtract the number of boxes given away from the total number of boxes she bought:

\[
\text{Boxes kept} = \text{Total boxes} - \text{Boxes given away} = 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
\]

### Step 4: Find out how many oranges she kept

Now, we need to calculate how many oranges are in the boxes she kept. Since she kept 8 boxes and each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she kept is:

\[
\text{Oranges kept} = \text{Boxes kept} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ oranges}
\]

### Step 5: Determine how many oranges she sold

Mrs. Harrington kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total oranges. To find out how many oranges that is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total oranges} = \frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60 \text{ oranges}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many oranges she sold. Since she originally had 240 oranges and kept 60, the number of oranges she sold is:

\[
\text{Oranges sold} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Oranges kept} = 240 - 60 = 180 \text{ oranges}
\]

### Final Answer

Mrs. Harrington sold **180 oranges**.
