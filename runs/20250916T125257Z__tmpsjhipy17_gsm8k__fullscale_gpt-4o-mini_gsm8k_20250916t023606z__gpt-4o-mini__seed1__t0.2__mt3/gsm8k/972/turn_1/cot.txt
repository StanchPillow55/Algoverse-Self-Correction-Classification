To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought**:
   - Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges**:
   - Each box contains 20 oranges. Therefore, the total number of oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 12 \times 20 = 240 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Determine how many boxes she gave away**:
   - Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each. Thus, the total number of boxes given away is:
     \[
     \text{Total boxes given away} = 2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington kept**:
   - The number of boxes she kept is:
     \[
     \text{Boxes kept} = \text{Total boxes} - \text{Boxes given away} = 12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington kept**:
   - Since she kept 8 boxes, the number of oranges she kept is:
     \[
     \text{Oranges kept} = \text{Boxes kept} \times \text{Oranges per box} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ oranges}
     \]

6. **Determine how many oranges she sold**:
   - According to the problem, Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges. Therefore, we need to find out how many oranges that is:
     \[
     \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total oranges} = \frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60 \text{ oranges}
     \]

7. **Calculate the number of oranges sold**:
   - To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges:
     \[
     \text{Oranges sold} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Oranges kept} = 240 - 60 = 180 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Finally, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]
