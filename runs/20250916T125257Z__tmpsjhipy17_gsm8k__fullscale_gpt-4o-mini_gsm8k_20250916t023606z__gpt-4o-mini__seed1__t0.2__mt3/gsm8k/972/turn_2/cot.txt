To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.**
2. **Determine how many boxes of oranges she gave away.**
3. **Calculate how many boxes she kept.**
4. **Find out how many oranges she kept.**
5. **Calculate how many oranges she sold.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.

Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges, and each box contains 20 oranges. 

\[
\text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Oranges per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total oranges} = 12 \times 20 = 240
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes of oranges she gave away.

Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes of oranges each. Therefore, the total number of boxes given away is:

\[
\text{Total boxes given away} = 2 \text{ (to mom)} + 2 \text{ (to sister)} = 4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many boxes she kept.

To find out how many boxes she kept, we subtract the boxes given away from the total boxes she bought:

\[
\text{Boxes kept} = \text{Total boxes} - \text{Boxes given away}
\]
\[
\text{Boxes kept} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

### Step 4: Find out how many oranges she kept.

Now, we calculate how many oranges are in the boxes she kept:

\[
\text{Oranges kept} = \text{Boxes kept} \times \text{Oranges per box}
\]
\[
\text{Oranges kept} = 8 \times 20 = 160
\]

### Step 5: Calculate how many oranges she sold.

Mrs. Harrington kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total oranges. First, we need to find out how many oranges that is:

\[
\text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times 240 = 60
\]

Now, we can find out how many oranges she sold by subtracting the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges:

\[
\text{Oranges sold} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Oranges kept}
\]
\[
\text{Oranges sold} = 240 - 60 = 180
\]

### Final Answer

Mrs. Harrington sold **180 oranges**.
