To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boys at Small Tree School.**
2. **Calculate how many boys were absent on Friday.**
3. **Find out how many boys were present on Friday.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of boys

We know the total number of fourth-graders is 96 and the number of girls is 43. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of girls}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many boys were absent on Friday

According to the problem, 4 boys were absent on Friday. 

### Step 3: Find out how many boys were present on Friday

To find the number of boys present on Friday, we subtract the number of boys who were absent from the total number of boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys present} = \text{Total boys} - \text{Boys absent}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys present} = 53 - 4 = 49
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys who were at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[
\boxed{49}
\]
