Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first, so the amount the second person took can be expressed as \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which can be expressed as \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount of money shared among the three people. The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   - The first person's share is \( x \).
   - The second person's share is \( x + 80 \).
   - The third person's share is \( 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

So, the equation becomes:

\[
x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920
\]

2. Combine like terms:
   - \( x + x + 2x = 4x \)
   - \( 80 + 160 = 240 \)

Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

3. Now, isolate \( 4x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240
\]
\[
4x = 1680
\]

4. Next, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1680}{4}
\]
\[
x = 420
\]

Now we have found the share of the first person, which is \( x = 420 \).

### Final Answer:
The share of the first person is **$420**.
