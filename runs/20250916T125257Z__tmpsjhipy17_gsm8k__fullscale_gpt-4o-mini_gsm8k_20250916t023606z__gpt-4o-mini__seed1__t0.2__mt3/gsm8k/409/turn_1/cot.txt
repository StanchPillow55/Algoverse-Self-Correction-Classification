To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May

1. **Number of employees hired**: 40
2. **Hourly wage per employee**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

**Total payment for one employee in May**:
\[
\text{Total payment for one employee} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for one employee} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total payment for all employees in May**:
\[
\text{Total payment for all employees} = \text{Total payment for one employee} \times \text{Number of employees}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for all employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 40 = 24000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June

1. **Contracts expired**: 1/4 of the employees
2. **Number of employees whose contracts expired**:
\[
\text{Employees with expired contracts} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]
3. **Remaining employees**:
\[
\text{Remaining employees} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

**Total payment for remaining employees in June**:
\[
\text{Total payment for remaining employees} = \text{Total payment for one employee} \times \text{Remaining employees}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for remaining employees} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months

**Total payment for both months**:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is **$42,000**.
