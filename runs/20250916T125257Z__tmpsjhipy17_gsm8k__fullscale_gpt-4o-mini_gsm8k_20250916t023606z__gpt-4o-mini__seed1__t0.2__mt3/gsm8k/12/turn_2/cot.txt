To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Initial Costs
- **Cost to plant the tree**: $90

### Step 2: Annual Revenue from Lemons
- **Lemons produced per year**: 7 lemons
- **Selling price per lemon**: $1.5
- **Annual revenue from lemons**: 
  \[
  \text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Lemons produced} \times \text{Selling price per lemon} = 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 3: Annual Costs
- **Annual cost to water and feed the tree**: $3

### Step 4: Annual Profit Calculation
To find the annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Break-even Analysis
Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment of $90 through his annual profit of $7.5.

To find the number of years required to break even, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\text{Total Profit} = \text{Annual Profit} \times \text{Number of Years}
\]
We want to find the number of years (let's denote it as \( y \)) such that:
\[
7.5y = 90
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( y \)
To find \( y \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:
\[
y = \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
\]

### Conclusion
It will take Carlos **12 years** to start earning money from the lemon tree after covering the initial planting cost and the ongoing annual expenses.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
