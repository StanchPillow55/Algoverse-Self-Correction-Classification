To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with the tree over time.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons.

Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, and Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue (R) from selling the lemons can be calculated as follows:

\[
R = \text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Price per lemon}
\]
\[
R = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the annual costs.

The annual costs (C) consist of the cost to water and feed the tree, which is $3 per year. 

### Step 3: Calculate the net annual profit.

The net annual profit (P) can be calculated by subtracting the annual costs from the annual revenue:

\[
P = R - C
\]
\[
P = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the initial investment.

Carlos has an initial investment of $90 to plant the tree.

### Step 5: Determine how many years it will take to recover the initial investment.

To find out how many years (Y) it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment through his annual profit, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Total profit after Y years} = \text{Initial investment}
\]
\[
P \times Y = 90
\]
Substituting the value of P:

\[
7.5 \times Y = 90
\]

### Step 6: Solve for Y.

To find Y, we divide both sides of the equation by 7.5:

\[
Y = \frac{90}{7.5}
\]
\[
Y = 12
\]

### Conclusion

It will take Carlos **12 years** to start earning money on the lemon tree after recovering his initial investment of $90. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
