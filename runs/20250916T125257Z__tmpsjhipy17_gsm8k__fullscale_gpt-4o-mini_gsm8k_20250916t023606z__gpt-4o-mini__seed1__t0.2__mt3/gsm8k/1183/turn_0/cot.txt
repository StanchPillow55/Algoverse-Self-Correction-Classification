Let's break down the problem step by step and keep track of the number of apples Newton has at each stage.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - Newton picks up these two apples.
   - At this point, Newton has **2 apples**.

2. **Putting One in His Pocket**:
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket.
   - Now, he has **1 apple in his hand** (the one he didn't put in his pocket) and **1 apple in his pocket**.
   - Total apples with Newton = **2 apples** (1 in hand + 1 in pocket).

3. **Throwing One Apple at the Tree**:
   - Newton throws the apple he has in his hand at the tree.
   - This action causes **5 more apples to fall out of the tree**.
   - Now, he has **5 new apples** that fell from the tree, plus the **1 apple in his pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **5 + 1 = 6 apples**.

4. **Putting All but One in His Pocket**:
   - Newton puts all but one of the 5 new apples in his pocket.
   - This means he keeps **1 apple** in his hand and puts **4 apples** in his pocket.
   - Now, he has **1 apple in hand** and **4 apples in pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **1 + 4 = 5 apples**.

5. **Throwing the Remaining Apple at the Tree**:
   - Newton throws the remaining apple he has in his hand at the tree.
   - This causes **6 more apples to fall out of the tree**.
   - Now, he has **6 new apples** that fell from the tree, plus the **4 apples in his pocket**.
   - Total apples now = **6 + 4 = 10 apples**.

6. **Final Count of Apples**:
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 new apples that fell out of the tree).
   - He already has **4 apples in his pocket**.
   - Total apples he brings home = **10 apples**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**Newton brought home 10 apples.**
