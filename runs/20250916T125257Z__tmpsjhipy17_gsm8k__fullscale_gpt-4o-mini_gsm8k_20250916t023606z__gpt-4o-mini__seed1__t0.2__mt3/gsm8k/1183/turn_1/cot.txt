Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell from the tree.
   - Newton picked up both apples.

   At this point, Newton has:
   \[
   2 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. **First Action**:
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket and throws the other apple into the tree.
   
   After this action, Newton has:
   \[
   1 \text{ apple in his pocket}
   \]

3. **Apples Falling from the Tree**:
   - Throwing the apple into the tree causes 5 more apples to fall out.
   
   Now, the total number of apples that have fallen (including the initial two) is:
   \[
   2 + 5 = 7 \text{ apples}
   \]

4. **Picking Up the Fallen Apples**:
   - Newton picks up these 5 new apples.
   
   Now, he has:
   \[
   1 \text{ (in pocket)} + 5 \text{ (picked up)} = 6 \text{ apples}
   \]

5. **Second Action**:
   - Newton puts all but one of the 5 new apples in his pocket and throws the remaining one at the tree.
   
   This means he puts 4 apples in his pocket and throws 1 apple. After this, he has:
   \[
   1 \text{ (in pocket)} + 4 \text{ (added to pocket)} = 5 \text{ apples in pocket}
   \]

6. **More Apples Falling from the Tree**:
   - Throwing the apple at the tree causes another 6 apples to fall out.
   
   Now, the total number of apples that have fallen (including the previous 7) is:
   \[
   7 + 6 = 13 \text{ apples}
   \]

7. **Picking Up the New Fallen Apples**:
   - Newton picks up these 6 new apples.
   
   Now, he has:
   \[
   5 \text{ (in pocket)} + 6 \text{ (picked up)} = 11 \text{ apples}
   \]

8. **Final Count**:
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 he just picked up) and goes home to make a pie.

Thus, the total number of apples Newton brings home is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
