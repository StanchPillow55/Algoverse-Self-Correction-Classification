To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we will first calculate the amount of material required for each type of mask separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the material needed for small masks

Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. To find out how much material is needed for one small mask, we can set up the following calculation:

\[
\text{Material per small mask} = \frac{\text{Total material for small masks}}{\text{Number of small masks}} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]

Now, to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks, we multiply the material needed for one small mask by the number of small masks:

\[
\text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the material needed for large masks

Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. To find out how much material is needed for one large mask, we perform a similar calculation:

\[
\text{Material per large mask} = \frac{\text{Total material for large masks}}{\text{Number of large masks}} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
\]

Next, we calculate the material needed for 8 large masks:

\[
\text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 3: Total material needed

Now, we add the material needed for both small and large masks to find the total material required:

\[
\text{Total material} = \text{Material for small masks} + \text{Material for large masks} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

### Final Answer

Jo needs a total of **16 yards** of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.
