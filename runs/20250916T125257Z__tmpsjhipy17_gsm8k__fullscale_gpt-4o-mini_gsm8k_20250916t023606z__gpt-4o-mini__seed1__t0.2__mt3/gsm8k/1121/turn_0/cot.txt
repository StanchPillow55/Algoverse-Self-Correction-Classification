To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Brian will walk in seven days based on the information provided about Sofie's walking distance.

1. **Determine Sofie's total walking distance in 7 days**:
   - Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day.
   - Therefore, in 7 days, the total distance Sofie will walk is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total distance Sofie walks} = \text{Daily distance} \times \text{Number of days} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 70 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Understand the relationship between Sofie's and Brian's walking distances**:
   - The problem states that in 7 days, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.
   - Let \( B \) represent the total distance Brian walks in 7 days.
   - According to the problem, we have the equation:
     \[
     70 \text{ miles} = 2B
     \]

3. **Solve for Brian's total walking distance**:
   - To find \( B \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     B = \frac{70 \text{ miles}}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Brian will walk a total of 35 miles in 7 days.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35 \text{ miles}}
\]
