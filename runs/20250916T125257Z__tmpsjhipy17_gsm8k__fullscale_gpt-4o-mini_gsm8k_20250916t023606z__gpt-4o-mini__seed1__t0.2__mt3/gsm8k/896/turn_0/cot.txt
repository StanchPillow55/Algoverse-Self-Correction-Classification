To determine John's profit from renting out his car, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total income from renting the car.**
2. **Subtract the car payment from the total income to find the profit.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Income

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. The payment he receives is $25 per hour.

- **Total hours rented per month**:
  \[
  \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of rentals} \times \text{Hours per rental} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total income from rentals**:
  \[
  \text{Total income} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 30 \text{ hours} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit

John's car payment is $500 per month. To find the profit, we subtract the car payment from the total income.

- **Profit calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Car payment} = 750 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Final Answer

John makes a profit of **$250** from renting out his car each month.
