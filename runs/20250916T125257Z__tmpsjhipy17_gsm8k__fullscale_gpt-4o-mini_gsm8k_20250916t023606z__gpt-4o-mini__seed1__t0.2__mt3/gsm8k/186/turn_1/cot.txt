To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents and set up an equation based on the total amount of straw distributed.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages of rats.
   - Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters.
   - Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - The rabbits receive a total of 20 pieces of straw.

2. **Calculate the total straw distributed to the rats:**
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (3 cages with \( r \) rats each).
   - Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the rats is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
     \]

3. **Calculate the total straw distributed to the hamsters:**
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \) (10 cages with \( h \) hamsters each).
   - Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total straw for the hamsters is:
     \[
     \text{Straw for hamsters} = 10h \times 5 = 50h
     \]

4. **Total straw distributed:**
   - The total straw distributed among all rodents is given as 160 pieces. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     18r + 50h + 20 = 160
     \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides:
     \[
     18r + 50h = 140
     \]

6. **Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):**
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     50h = 140 - 18r
     \]
   - Dividing by 50:
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
     \]

7. **Finding integer solutions:**
   - Since \( h \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be non-negative and divisible by 50.
   - We can test integer values for \( r \) to find suitable values for \( h \).

8. **Testing values for \( r \):**
   - **If \( r = 0 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 1 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(1)}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 2 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 3 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(3)}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 4 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 5 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 6 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(6)}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]
   - **If \( r = 7 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(7)}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The only integer solution found is when \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is:
     \[
     \boxed{5}
     \]
