To solve the problem, we need to break down the information given and set up equations based on the distribution of straw among the rodents.

1. **Understanding the distribution of straw:**
   - **Rats:** There are 3 cages of rats, and each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
   - **Hamsters:** There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw.
   - **Rabbits:** A total of 20 pieces of straw is distributed among the rabbits.

2. **Total straw distributed:**
   - We know that the total amount of straw distributed among all the rodents is 160 pieces.

3. **Setting up the equations:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - The total number of rats is \( 3r \) (since there are 3 cages).
   - The total straw given to the rats is \( 3r \times 6 = 18r \) pieces of straw.
   
   - Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage.
   - The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \) (since there are 10 cages).
   - The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 10h \times 5 = 50h \) pieces of straw.

4. **Total straw equation:**
   - The total straw distributed can be expressed as:
   \[
   18r + 50h + 20 = 160
   \]

5. **Simplifying the equation:**
   - We can simplify this equation by subtracting 20 from both sides:
   \[
   18r + 50h = 140
   \]

6. **Finding integer solutions:**
   - We need to find integer values for \( r \) and \( h \) that satisfy this equation. To do this, we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
   \[
   50h = 140 - 18r
   \]
   \[
   h = \frac{140 - 18r}{50}
   \]

   - For \( h \) to be an integer, \( 140 - 18r \) must be divisible by 50. We can check various integer values for \( r \) to find suitable values for \( h \).

7. **Testing values for \( r \):**
   - Let's test \( r = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \) until we find integer solutions for \( h \):

   - **For \( r = 0 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(0)}{50} = \frac{140}{50} = 2.8 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 1 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(1)}{50} = \frac{122}{50} = 2.44 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 2 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(2)}{50} = \frac{104}{50} = 2.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 3 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(3)}{50} = \frac{86}{50} = 1.72 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 4 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(4)}{50} = \frac{68}{50} = 1.36 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 5 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(5)}{50} = \frac{50}{50} = 1 \quad \text{(integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 6 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(6)}{50} = \frac{32}{50} = 0.64 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 7 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(7)}{50} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

   - **For \( r = 8 \):**
     \[
     h = \frac{140 - 18(8)}{50} = \frac{-4}{50} = -0.08 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The only integer solution we found is \( r = 5 \) and \( h = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is \( \boxed{5} \).
