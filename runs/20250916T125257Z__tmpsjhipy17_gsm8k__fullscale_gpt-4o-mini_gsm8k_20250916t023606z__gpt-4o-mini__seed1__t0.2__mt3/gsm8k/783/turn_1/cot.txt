To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 7 fish in total: 3 orange and 4 white.

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We need to find out how many of these are white and how many are orange.

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

4. **Setting Up Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of orange fish Bob bought from the store.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of white fish Bob bought from the store.

   From the problem, we know:
   \[
   x + y = 17 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

5. **Final Counts of Fish**:
   - After adding the fish from the store, the total number of orange fish Bob has is \( 3 + x \).
   - The total number of white fish Bob has is \( 4 + y \).

   According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + x = 2(4 + y) \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

6. **Expanding Equation (2)**:
   \[
   3 + x = 8 + 2y
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(3)}
   \]

7. **Solving the System of Equations**:
   We now have two equations:
   - Equation (1): \( x + y = 17 \)
   - Equation (3): \( x - 2y = 5 \)

   We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation (1), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
   \[
   x = 17 - y \quad \text{(4)}
   \]

   Now, substitute Equation (4) into Equation (3):
   \[
   (17 - y) - 2y = 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3y = 5
   \]
   \[
   -3y = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3y = -12
   \]
   \[
   y = 4
   \]

8. **Finding \( x \)**:
   Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using Equation (4):
   \[
   x = 17 - y = 17 - 4 = 13
   \]

9. **Conclusion**:
   Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish from the store.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
