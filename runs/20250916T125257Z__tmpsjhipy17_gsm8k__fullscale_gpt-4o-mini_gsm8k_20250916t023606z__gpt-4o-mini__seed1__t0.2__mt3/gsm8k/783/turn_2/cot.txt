To solve the problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the pet store. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob initially has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish Bob initially has is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Pet Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. We will denote the number of orange fish he bought as \( x \) and the number of white fish he bought as \( y \).
   - From the problem, we know:
     \[
     x + y = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the pet store to his pond, Bob has:
     - Orange fish: \( 3 + x \)
     - White fish: \( 4 + y \)

4. **Condition Given**:
   - The problem states that after adding the fish, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 2(4 + y)
     \]

5. **Expanding the Condition**:
   - Let's expand the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 8 + 2y
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives:
     \[
     x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

6. **System of Equations**:
   - Now we have a system of two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 17 \) (Equation 2)
     2. \( x - 2y = 5 \) (Equation 1)

7. **Solving the System**:
   - We can solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using Equation 2:
     \[
     x = 17 - y
     \]
   - Substitute \( x \) into Equation 1:
     \[
     (17 - y) - 2y = 5
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     17 - 3y = 5
     \]
   - Rearranging to solve for \( y \):
     \[
     17 - 5 = 3y \\
     12 = 3y \\
     y = 4
     \]

8. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - Now substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x + 4 = 17 \\
     x = 17 - 4 \\
     x = 13
     \]

9. **Final Counts**:
   - Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish.

10. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]
