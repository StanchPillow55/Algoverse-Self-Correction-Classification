To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Fish Count**:
   - Bob starts with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish he initially has is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys 17 fish from the pet store. We need to determine how many of these are orange and how many are white.

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob has:
     \[
     7 \text{ (initial fish)} + 17 \text{ (new fish)} = 24 \text{ fish}
     \]

4. **Condition Given**:
   - After adding the new fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. Letâ€™s denote:
     - The number of white fish Bob bought as \( w \).
     - The number of orange fish Bob bought as \( o \).

   Since he bought a total of 17 fish, we have:
   \[
   o + w = 17
   \]

5. **Final Counts of Fish**:
   - After adding the new fish, the total number of orange fish is:
     \[
     3 + o
     \]
   - The total number of white fish is:
     \[
     4 + w
     \]

6. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the number of orange fish is twice the number of white fish:
   \[
   3 + o = 2(4 + w)
   \]

7. **Expanding and Rearranging the Equation**:
   - Expanding the right side:
   \[
   3 + o = 8 + 2w
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   o - 2w = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

8. **Substituting for \( o \)**:
   - From the total fish equation \( o + w = 17 \), we can express \( o \) in terms of \( w \):
   \[
   o = 17 - w \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

9. **Substituting Equation 2 into Equation 1**:
   - Substitute \( o \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
   \[
   (17 - w) - 2w = 5
   \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   17 - 3w = 5
   \]
   - Rearranging gives:
   \[
   -3w = 5 - 17
   \]
   \[
   -3w = -12
   \]
   \[
   w = 4
   \]

10. **Finding \( o \)**:
    - Now substituting \( w = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( o \):
    \[
    o = 17 - 4 = 13
    \]

11. **Final Counts**:
    - Bob bought 4 white fish and 13 orange fish.

12. **Conclusion**:
    - The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
    \[
    \boxed{4}
    \]
