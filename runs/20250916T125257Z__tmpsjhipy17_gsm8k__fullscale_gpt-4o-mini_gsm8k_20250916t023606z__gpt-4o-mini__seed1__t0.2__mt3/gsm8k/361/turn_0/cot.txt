To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total distance the train travels in one complete trip from the first city to the second city, then to the third city, and back to the first city. 

1. **Calculate the distances:**
   - Distance from the first city to the second city: \(75\) miles
   - Distance from the second city to the third city: \(100\) miles
   - Combined distance from the first city to the second city and from the second city to the third city:
     \[
     75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The distance from the third city back to the first city is \(50\) miles less than the combined distance:
     \[
     175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance for one complete trip:**
   - The total distance for one complete trip (first city to second city to third city and back to first city) is:
     \[
     75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled in one day:**
   - The train makes this trip \(3\) times a day, so the total distance traveled in one day is:
     \[
     300 \times 3 = 900 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many days the train can operate before needing service:**
   - The train needs service every \(18,000\) miles. To find out how many days it can operate before needing service, we divide the total service distance by the daily distance:
     \[
     \frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the train can go **20 days** between services.

**Final Answer: 20 days**
