To determine Millie's profit per hour from her lemonade stand, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade**:
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
   - Millie makes 3 pitchers.
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling lemonade**:
   - Millie sells each cup for $1.
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies**:
   - Millie spends $18 on supplies.

4. **Calculate the total profit**:
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs.
   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how many hours Millie spends running the lemonade stand**:
   - Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - To find out how many hours it takes to sell all 36 cups:
   \[
   \text{Hours} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour**:
   - To find the profit per hour, divide the total profit by the number of hours.
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Hours}} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

Thus, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is \(\boxed{2}\) dollars.
