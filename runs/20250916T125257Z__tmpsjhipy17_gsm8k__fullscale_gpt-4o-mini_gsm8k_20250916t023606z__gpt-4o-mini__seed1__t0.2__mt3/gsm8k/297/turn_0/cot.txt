To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target sales**: Sam's target is to sell 120 crates of bread in a week.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the week**: We will add up the number of crates sold on each day he was open.

   - **Sales on the weekend**: 20 crates
   - **Sales on Tuesday**: 15 crates
   - **Sales on Wednesday**: 12 crates
   - **Sales on Thursday**: 18 crates

   Now, we will sum these amounts:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Sales on weekend} + \text{Sales on Tuesday} + \text{Sales on Wednesday} + \text{Sales on Thursday}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:

   \[
   20 + 15 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 12 = 47
   \]
   \[
   47 + 18 = 65
   \]

   Therefore, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

3. **Calculate how many crates he was off from his target**: To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total sales from the target sales.

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = \text{Target sales} - \text{Total sales}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = 120 - 65
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   120 - 65 = 55
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
