To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amount of water passing through the river at each stage.

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: 
   The problem states that the amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 4000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After Heavy Rain (Day 1)**: 
   After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, we calculate the new amount:

   \[
   \text{Amount after rain} = 2 \times \text{Initial amount} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Increase on the Third Day**: 
   On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. We need to add this increase to the amount of water from Day 1:

   \[
   \text{Total amount on Day 3} = \text{Amount after rain} + 6000 = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: 
   Now we have calculated the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the rain and the increase on the third day:

   \[
   \text{Final total amount} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is:

\[
\boxed{14000} \text{ gallons}
\]
