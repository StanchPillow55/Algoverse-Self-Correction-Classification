To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at the specified point over the three days.

1. **Initial Amount of Water**:
   - On the first day, the amount of water passing through the river is given as 4000 gallons.

2. **Amount of Water After Heavy Rain**:
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. Therefore, we calculate the new amount:
   \[
   \text{Amount after rain} = 2 \times 4000 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Amount of Water on the Third Day**:
   - On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons. We add this increase to the amount from the second day:
   \[
   \text{Amount on the third day} = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Total Amount of Water**:
   - Now, we need to find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days. We will sum the amounts from each day:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 4000 + 8000 + 14000
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - Now we perform the addition:
   \[
   4000 + 8000 = 12000
   \]
   \[
   12000 + 14000 = 26000
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point over the three days is:

\[
\boxed{26000} \text{ gallons}
\]
