To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we will break the problem down into two parts based on his egg consumption.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days:**
   - Chester eats 3 eggs a day.
   - For 30 days, the total number of eggs is:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days:**
   - Chester increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day.
   - For the next 30 days, the total number of eggs is:
     \[
     5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over the 60 days:**
   - Now, we add the eggs from both periods:
     \[
     90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Thus, Chester will need a total of **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.

**Final Answer: 20 dozens**
