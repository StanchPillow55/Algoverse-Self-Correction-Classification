To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we can break the problem down into two parts: the first 30 days and the next 30 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days.
Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days.

\[
\text{Eggs eaten in first 30 days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days.
Chester then increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.

\[
\text{Eggs eaten in next 30 days} = 5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs eaten over 60 days.
Now, we add the number of eggs eaten in both periods:

\[
\text{Total eggs eaten} = 90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens:

\[
\text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 20 \text{ dozens}
\]

### Final Answer
Chester will need **20 dozens of eggs** for 60 days.
