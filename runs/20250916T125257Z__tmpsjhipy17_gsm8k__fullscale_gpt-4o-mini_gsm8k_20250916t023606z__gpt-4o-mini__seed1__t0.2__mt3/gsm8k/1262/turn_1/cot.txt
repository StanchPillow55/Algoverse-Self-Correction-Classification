To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take John to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed after training.

**Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed.**

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster than his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5 = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.**

Each page has 450 words, and there are 10 pages. Therefore, the total number of words is:

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Words per Page} \times \text{Number of Pages} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Words} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.**

To find the time in minutes, we divide the total number of words by the new speaking speed:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{New Speed}} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

It would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed.
