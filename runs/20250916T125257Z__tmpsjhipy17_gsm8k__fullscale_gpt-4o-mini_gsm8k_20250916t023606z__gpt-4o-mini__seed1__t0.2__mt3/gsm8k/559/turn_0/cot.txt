To solve the problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks and how much he needs to reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's coffee intake:**
   - Let \( R \) be the daily recommended cups of coffee.
   - According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended amount:
     \[
     \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
     \]

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:
     \[
     \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
     \]

3. **Determine the doctor's recommendation for Juan:**
   - Juan's doctor has recommended that he reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups:
     \[
     \text{Doctor's recommendation} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake:**
   - We need to find the difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = \text{Juan's current intake} - \text{Doctor's recommendation}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - 4
     \]

5. **Determine the value of \( R \):**
   - Since we know that the doctor recommends 4 cups, we can set \( R \) equal to 4 cups (the daily recommended amount):
     \[
     R = 4
     \]

6. **Substitute \( R \) back into the reduction formula:**
   - Now we substitute \( R = 4 \) into the reduction needed:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5(4) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by **16 cups**.

**Final Answer: 16 cups**
