To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total drying time for 6 paintings using both the old varnish and the new varnish, and then find the difference between the two times.

1. **Calculate the drying time with the old varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the old varnish is 7 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time with old varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the drying time with the new varnish:**
   - The drying time for one painting with the new varnish is 12 minutes.
   - For 6 paintings, the total drying time is:
     \[
     \text{Total time with new varnish} = 6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Find the difference in drying times:**
   - To find out how much longer it takes with the new varnish compared to the old varnish, we subtract the total time with the old varnish from the total time with the new varnish:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Total time with new varnish} - \text{Total time with old varnish}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 72 \text{ minutes} - 42 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish will take **30 minutes longer** to dry than it would with the old varnish.

**Final Answer: 30 minutes longer**
