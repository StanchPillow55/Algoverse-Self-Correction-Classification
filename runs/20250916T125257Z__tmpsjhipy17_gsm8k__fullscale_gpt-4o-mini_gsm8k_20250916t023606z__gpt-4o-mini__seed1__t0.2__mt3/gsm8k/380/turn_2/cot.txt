To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including interest, and then divide that total by the number of months over which she will make payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to calculate the interest for the loan.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum (which is 0.10 as a decimal)
- Time = 5 months (we need to convert this to years for the calculation, so \( \frac{5}{12} \) years)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} \):
   \[
   0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 0.04167
   \]

2. Now multiply by the principal:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08
   \]

So, the total interest Karan will pay over the five months is approximately $152.08.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid

Now, we need to calculate the total amount Karan has to repay, which is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will make equal payments over 5 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately **$760.42** per month. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{760.42}
\]
