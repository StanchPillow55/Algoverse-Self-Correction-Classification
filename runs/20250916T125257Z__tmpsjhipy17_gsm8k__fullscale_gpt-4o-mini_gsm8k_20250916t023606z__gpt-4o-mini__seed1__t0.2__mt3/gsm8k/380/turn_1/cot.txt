To solve the problem of how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total interest on the loan.**
2. **Determine the total amount to be repaid.**
3. **Calculate the monthly payment.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. The interest can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}\):

\[
0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 0.04167
\]

2. Now calculate the interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.08
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Amount to be Repaid

The total amount Karan has to repay is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will pay this total amount over 5 months. Therefore, the monthly payment can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.08}{5} \approx 760.416
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to the nearest cent, Karan has to pay approximately:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} \approx 760.42
\]

Thus, Karan has to pay **$760.42** per month.
