To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months she will be repaying the loan.

### Step 1: Calculate the interest on the loan

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to find out how much interest she will owe over this period.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10 (as a decimal)
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the interest rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate \(0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}\):

\[
0.10 \times \frac{5}{12} = \frac{0.10 \times 5}{12} = \frac{0.5}{12} \approx 0.04167
\]

2. Now calculate the interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.04
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount to be repaid

Now that we have the interest, we can calculate the total amount Karan will need to repay:

\[
\text{Total Repayment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Repayment} = 3650 + 152.04 \approx 3802.04
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment

Karan will be repaying this total amount over 5 months. Therefore, we divide the total repayment by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Repayment}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.04}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} \approx 760.408
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately **$760.41** per month.
