To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each of the twenty students raised for the charity.

1. **Identify the total amount raised by the charity**: 
   The total amount raised is $175,000.

2. **Determine the amount raised from organizations**: 
   According to the problem, $50,000 of the total amount comes from organizations.

3. **Calculate the amount raised by the students**: 
   To find out how much the students raised, we subtract the amount raised from organizations from the total amount raised:
   \[
   \text{Amount raised by students} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Amount from organizations}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount raised by students} = 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000
   \]

4. **Determine how much each student raised**: 
   Since there are 20 students, we need to divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students to find out how much each student raised:
   \[
   \text{Amount raised by each student} = \frac{\text{Amount raised by students}}{\text{Number of students}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount raised by each student} = \frac{125,000}{20}
   \]

5. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250
   \]

Thus, each student raised **$6,250**.

### Final Answer:
Each student raised **$6,250**.
