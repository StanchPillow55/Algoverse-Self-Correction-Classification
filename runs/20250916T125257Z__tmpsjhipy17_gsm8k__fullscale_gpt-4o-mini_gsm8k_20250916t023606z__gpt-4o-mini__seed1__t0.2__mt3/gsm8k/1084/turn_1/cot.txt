To solve the problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam and Harry each receive, given that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam and that the total amount of fence is 100 feet.

Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam receives as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry receives as:

\[
H = S + 60
\]

We know that the total amount of fence they have together is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we can combine like terms:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, Sam receives 20 feet of fence. Now, we can find out how much Harry receives by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Thus, Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

Finally, we can check our work by confirming that the total amount of fence adds up to 100 feet:

\[
S + H = 20 + 80 = 100
\]

Everything checks out, so the final answer is:

**Sam has 20 feet of fence.**
