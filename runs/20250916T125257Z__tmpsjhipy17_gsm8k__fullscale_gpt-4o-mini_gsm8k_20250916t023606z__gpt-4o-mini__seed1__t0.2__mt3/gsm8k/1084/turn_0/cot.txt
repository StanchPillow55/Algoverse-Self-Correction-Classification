To solve the problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam and Harry each get, given that Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam and that together they have a total of 100 feet of fence.

Let's denote the amount of fence Sam receives as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, which we can express as:

\[
H = S + 60
\]

where \( H \) is the amount of fence Harry receives.

Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, we simplify this equation:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

So, Sam receives 20 feet of fence.

Now, we can find out how much fence Harry receives by substituting \( S \) back into the equation for \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

Thus, Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

Finally, we can summarize the results:
- Sam receives 20 feet of fence.
- Harry receives 80 feet of fence.

The question asks how much is left over for Sam. Since we calculated that Sam receives 20 feet, there is no leftover fence for Sam beyond what he has already received.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence.}
\]
