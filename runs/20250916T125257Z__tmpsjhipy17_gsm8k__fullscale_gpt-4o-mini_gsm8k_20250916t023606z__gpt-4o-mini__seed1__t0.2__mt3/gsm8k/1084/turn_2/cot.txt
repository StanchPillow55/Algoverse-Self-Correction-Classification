Let's denote the amount of fence that Sam gets as \( S \) feet. According to the problem, Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express the amount of fence Harry gets as \( H = S + 60 \) feet.

The total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + H = 100
\]

Substituting the expression for \( H \) into the equation gives us:

\[
S + (S + 60) = 100
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
2S + 60 = 100
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first subtracting 60 from both sides:

\[
2S = 100 - 60
\]
\[
2S = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( H \):

\[
H = S + 60 = 20 + 60 = 80
\]

To check our work, we can verify that the total length of the fence is indeed 100 feet:

\[
S + H = 20 + 80 = 100
\]

Since the calculations are correct, we can conclude that Sam gets 20 feet of fence.

The question asks how much is left over for Sam. Since he is allocated 20 feet, there is no leftover fence for him. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence, and there is no leftover.}
\]
