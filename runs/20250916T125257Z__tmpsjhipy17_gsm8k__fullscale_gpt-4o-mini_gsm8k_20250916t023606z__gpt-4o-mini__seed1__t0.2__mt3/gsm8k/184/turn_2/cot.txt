To solve the problem, we need to determine two probabilities: 

1. The probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
2. The probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- Total outcomes when rolling a die = 6 (the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 3) = 3 (the numbers 4, 5, and 6)

The probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

- Total outcomes when rolling a die = 6
- Favorable outcomes for one roll (even numbers) = 3 (the numbers 2, 4, and 6)

The probability of rolling an even number in one roll \( P(\text{even}) \) is:

\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row \( P(\text{two evens}) \) is:

\[
P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities

Now we need to find out how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We can express this as a ratio of the two probabilities:

\[
\text{Likelihood ratio} = \frac{P(\text{greater than 3})}{P(\text{two evens})} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1/2}{1/4} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{4}{1} = 2
\]

This means that rolling a number greater than 3 is 2 times more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 4: Expressing the likelihood as a percentage

To express how much more likely it is in percentage terms, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \text{Likelihood ratio} - 1 \right) \times 100\%
\]

Since the likelihood ratio is 2, we have:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = (2 - 1) \times 100\% = 1 \times 100\% = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
