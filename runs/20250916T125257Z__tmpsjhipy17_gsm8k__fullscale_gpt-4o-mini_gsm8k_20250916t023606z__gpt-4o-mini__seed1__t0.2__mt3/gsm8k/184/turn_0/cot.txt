To solve the problem, we need to determine two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

**Count of favorable outcomes:**
- Numbers greater than 3: 4, 5, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Total outcomes when rolling a die:**
- Total outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

**Count of favorable outcomes for one roll:**
- Even numbers: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling an even number:**
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an even number on each roll:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the Two Probabilities

Now we need to compare the two probabilities:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of rolling two even numbers: \( \frac{1}{4} \)

To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Expressing the Difference as a Percentage

To express the difference as a percentage, we take the difference and divide it by the probability of rolling two even numbers, then multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{P(\text{two even numbers})} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}} \right) \times 100 = 1 \times 100 = 100\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 100% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
