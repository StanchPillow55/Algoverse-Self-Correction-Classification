To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- **Total outcomes**: 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)
- **Favorable outcomes**: 3 (the numbers 4, 5, and 6)

The probability \( P(A) \) of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as follows:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

To express this as a percentage:

\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

- **Total outcomes**: 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)
- **Favorable outcomes for one roll**: 3 (the numbers 2, 4, and 6)

The probability \( P(B) \) of rolling an even number on one roll is:

\[
P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row \( P(B \text{ and } B) \) is the product of the probabilities of each roll:

\[
P(B \text{ and } B) = P(B) \times P(B) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To express this as a percentage:

\[
P(B \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities

Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. We do this by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

\[
\text{Difference} = P(A) - P(B \text{ and } B) = 50\% - 25\% = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is **25%** more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
