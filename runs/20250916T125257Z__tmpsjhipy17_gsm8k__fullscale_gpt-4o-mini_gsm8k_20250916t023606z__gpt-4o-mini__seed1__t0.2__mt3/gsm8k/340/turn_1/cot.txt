To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Balls**: Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Adding Balls Each Week**: Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. Since the talent show is in 4 weeks, we can calculate the total number of balls he will be juggling at the end of the fourth week.

   - **Week 1**: 3 balls
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh will be juggling **6 balls**.

3. **Incident on Stage**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.

4. **Balls Caught and Lost**: Out of the 3 balls he dropped:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball gets lost completely.

5. **Calculating Remaining Balls**: To find out how many balls Josh is juggling on stage, we subtract the number of balls he dropped from the total number of balls he was juggling.

   - Total balls before the incident: 6
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Remaining balls after dropping: 6 - 3 = 3 balls

6. **Final Count**: Since 2 of the dropped balls were caught and 1 was lost, the number of balls Josh has left to juggle is:

   - Remaining balls after catching and losing: 3 balls (as calculated above)

Thus, Josh starts to juggle on stage with **3 balls**.

**Final Answer**: 3 balls.
