To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Practice**: Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Weekly Progression**: Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling routine. We need to determine how many balls he is juggling at the end of each week:
   - **Week 1**: 3 balls
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   At the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling **6 balls**.

3. **Incident on Stage**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. 

4. **Recovery of Balls**: Out of the 3 balls he dropped:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

5. **Calculating Remaining Balls**: 
   - Initially, he had 6 balls.
   - After dropping 3 balls, he has: 
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - Since 2 of the dropped balls are caught, they are not lost to him. Therefore, he still has:
     \[
     3 \text{ balls (remaining)} + 2 \text{ balls (caught)} = 5 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - However, since he lost 1 ball completely, we need to subtract that from the total:
     \[
     5 - 1 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]

6. **Final Count**: Thus, when Josh starts juggling on stage, he has **4 balls**.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
