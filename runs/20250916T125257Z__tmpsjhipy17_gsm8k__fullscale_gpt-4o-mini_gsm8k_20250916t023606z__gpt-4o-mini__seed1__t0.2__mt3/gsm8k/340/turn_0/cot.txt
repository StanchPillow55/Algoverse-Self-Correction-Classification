To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balls Josh is juggling at the end of the fourth week before the talent show, and then account for the balls he drops during his performance.

1. **Initial Number of Balls**: Josh starts practicing with 3 balls.

2. **Adding Balls Each Week**: Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. We need to calculate how many balls he has at the end of each week for 4 weeks.

   - **Week 1**: 
     \[
     3 + 1 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 2**: 
     \[
     4 + 1 = 5 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 3**: 
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6 \text{ balls}
     \]
   - **Week 4**: 
     \[
     6 + 1 = 7 \text{ balls}
     \]

   After 4 weeks, Josh is juggling **7 balls**.

3. **Dropping Balls During Performance**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.

4. **Balls Caught and Lost**: Out of the 3 balls he drops:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball is lost completely.

5. **Calculating the Number of Balls Remaining**: To find out how many balls Josh is juggling on stage after the incident, we subtract the number of balls he dropped from the total number of balls he had.

   - Total balls before dropping: 7
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Balls remaining after dropping: 
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4 \text{ balls}
     \]

Thus, after accounting for the balls he dropped, Josh is left juggling **4 balls** on stage.

**Final Answer**: Josh starts juggling on stage with **4 balls**.
