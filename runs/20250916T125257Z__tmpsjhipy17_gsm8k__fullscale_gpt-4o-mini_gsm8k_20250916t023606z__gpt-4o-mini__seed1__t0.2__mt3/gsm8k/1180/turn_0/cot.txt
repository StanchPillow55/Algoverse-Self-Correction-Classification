To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of milk that Mr. Marcellus returned to the company and then determine how much he will receive as a refund based on the cost per gallon.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk purchased
Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk.

### Step 2: Determine how much milk was expired
According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date. We can calculate the amount of expired milk as follows:

\[
\text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \text{ gallons}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Expired milk} = \frac{2 \times 4000}{5} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the refund amount
Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the expired milk that Mr. Marcellus will return. The cost per gallon of milk is $3.5. Therefore, the total refund can be calculated by multiplying the number of gallons of expired milk by the cost per gallon:

\[
\text{Refund} = \text{Expired milk} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Refund} = 1600 \text{ gallons} \times 3.5 \text{ dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Refund} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Mr. Marcellus received a refund of **$5600**.
