To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of days in the week**: There are 7 days in a week.

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days**:
   - The tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days.
   - Therefore, the total number of cars towed in the first three days is:
     \[
     \text{Cars towed in first three days} = 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of cars towed on the remaining days**:
   - The remaining days of the week are \(7 - 3 = 4\) days.
   - The problem states that the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars on each of these remaining days compared to the first three days.
   - Since it towed 10 cars each day for the first three days, the number of cars towed on each of the remaining days is:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cars towed in the remaining four days**:
   - The total number of cars towed in the remaining four days is:
     \[
     \text{Cars towed in remaining four days} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cars towed for the entire week**:
   - Now, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
     \[
     \text{Total cars towed} = \text{Cars towed in first three days} + \text{Cars towed in remaining four days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cars towed} = 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
     \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week is \( \boxed{54} \).
