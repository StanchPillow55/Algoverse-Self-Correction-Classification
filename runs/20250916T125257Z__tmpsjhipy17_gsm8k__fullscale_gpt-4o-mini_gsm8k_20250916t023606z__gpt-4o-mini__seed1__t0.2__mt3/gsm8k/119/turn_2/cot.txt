To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's Salary Four Years Ago**:
   We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

   Since Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000, we can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   where \( A \) is Adrien's salary. Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
   \[
   40000 = 1.3L
   \]
   To find \( L \), we divide both sides by 1.3:
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
   \]
   So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

2. **Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later**:
   We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Thus, his salary four years later can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{New Adrien's Salary} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000 = 40000 \times 1.4 = 56000
   \]

3. **Calculate Lylah's Salary Four Years Later**:
   The problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. However, we do not know the exact percentage increase for Lylah. We will denote Lylah's salary increase as \( x \) percent.

   Lylah's salary four years later can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{New Lylah's Salary} = L + \frac{x}{100}L = L(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]
   Since we do not have the value of \( x \), we will keep it in this form for now.

4. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later**:
   The total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later is:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = \text{New Adrien's Salary} + \text{New Lylah's Salary}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + L(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]
   We already calculated \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + 30769.23(1 + \frac{x}{100})
   \]

5. **Assuming Lylah's Salary Increase**:
   Since we do not have the exact percentage increase for Lylah, we can assume that her salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%. Thus, we can set \( x = 40 \):
   \[
   \text{New Lylah's Salary} = 30769.23(1 + 0.4) = 30769.23 \times 1.4 \approx 43076.92
   \]

6. **Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later**:
   Now we can calculate the total salary:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately:
   \[
   \boxed{99076.92}
   \]
