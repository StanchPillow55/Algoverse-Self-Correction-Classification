To solve the problem, we need to determine Lylah's salary and then calculate both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's Salary

We know that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Let Lylah's salary be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem, Adrien's salary \( A \) can be expressed as:
\[
A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
A = 40000
\]

Now we can set up the equation:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can solve for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later \( A' \) can be calculated as:
\[
A' = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
\]
Substituting \( A = 40000 \):
\[
A' = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's Salary Four Years Later

Since the problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's four years ago, and we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage as Adrien's increase (40%).

Thus, Lylah's salary four years later \( L' \) can be calculated as:
\[
L' = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \approx 30769.23 \):
\[
L' = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Salary Four Years Later

Now we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total Salary} = A' + L' = 56000 + 43076.92
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Total Salary} \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.
