To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.**
2. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.**
3. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.**
4. **Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.**

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.

We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

According to the problem:
\[
\text{Adrien's salary} = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
\]

We also know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000:
\[
1.3L = 40000
\]

To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
\]

Calculating \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23
\]

So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.

Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Adrien's salary four years later} = 40000 + 0.4 \times 40000
\]
\[
= 40000 + 16000 = 56000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

Since the problem states that Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago, so we can assume that Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage.

Letâ€™s calculate Lylah's salary increase. Since we do not have a specific percentage increase for Lylah, we will assume it is the same as Adrien's increase of 40% for simplicity.

Calculating Lylah's salary four years later:
\[
\text{Lylah's salary four years later} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
\]
Substituting \( L \):
\[
= 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
\]

### Step 4: Sum the two salaries to find the total salary four years later.

Now we can find the total salary of Adrien and Lylah four years later:
\[
\text{Total salary} = \text{Adrien's salary four years later} + \text{Lylah's salary four years later}
\]
\[
= 56000 + 43076.92 \approx 99076.92
\]

### Final Answer

The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.
