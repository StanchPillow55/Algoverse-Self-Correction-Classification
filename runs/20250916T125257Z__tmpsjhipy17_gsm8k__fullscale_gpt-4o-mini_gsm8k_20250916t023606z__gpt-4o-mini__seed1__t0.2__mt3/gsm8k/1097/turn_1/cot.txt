To find out how many people were inside the church after Mary and John's wedding ceremony, we need to calculate the total number of people that arrived in the cars and buses.

1. **Calculate the number of people in the buses:**
   - There are 12 buses.
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people in the buses can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total people in buses} = \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus} = 12 \times 35
   \]

   Now, let's do the multiplication:

   \[
   12 \times 35 = 420
   \]

   So, there are 420 people in the buses.

2. **Calculate the number of people in the cars:**
   - There are 20 private cars.
   - Each car carries 3 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people in the cars can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total people in cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car} = 20 \times 3
   \]

   Now, let's do the multiplication:

   \[
   20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

   So, there are 60 people in the cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of people inside the church:**
   - To find the total number of people who attended the ceremony, we need to add the number of people in the buses and the number of people in the cars:

   \[
   \text{Total people inside the church} = \text{Total people in buses} + \text{Total people in cars} = 420 + 60
   \]

   Now, let's do the addition:

   \[
   420 + 60 = 480
   \]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is **480**.

Final answer: **480 people** were inside the church.
