To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones that John buys for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. 

1. **Identify the number of phones**: 
   - John is buying phones for himself (1), his wife (1), and his 2 kids (2). 
   - Total number of phones = 1 (John) + 1 (wife) + 2 (kids) = 4 phones.

2. **Determine the price of the phones**:
   - The price of each phone is $600.
   - The first two phones are sold at full price, and any additional phones (after the first two) are sold at half price.

3. **Calculate the cost for the first two phones**:
   - Cost of the first phone = $600
   - Cost of the second phone = $600
   - Total cost for the first two phones = $600 + $600 = $1200.

4. **Calculate the cost for the third and fourth phones**:
   - Since the third and fourth phones are half price, we first calculate half of the price of a phone:
     - Half price = $600 / 2 = $300.
   - Cost of the third phone = $300.
   - Cost of the fourth phone = $300.
   - Total cost for the third and fourth phones = $300 + $300 = $600.

5. **Calculate the total cost for all four phones**:
   - Total cost = Cost of first two phones + Cost of third and fourth phones
   - Total cost = $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Thus, the total amount John paid for all the phones is **$1800**.

Final answer: **$1800**.
