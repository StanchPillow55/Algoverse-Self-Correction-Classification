To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds separately, and then add those two amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
   - The cost of each packet of tomato seeds is $40.
   - To find the total cost for the tomato seeds, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} = 800
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the celery seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
   - The cost of each packet of celery seeds is $30.
   - To find the total cost for the celery seeds, we again multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of celery seeds} = 2400
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for all seeds:**
   - Now we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of tomato seeds} + \text{Total cost of celery seeds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3200
   \]

Therefore, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is **$3200**. 

Final answer: **$3200**.
