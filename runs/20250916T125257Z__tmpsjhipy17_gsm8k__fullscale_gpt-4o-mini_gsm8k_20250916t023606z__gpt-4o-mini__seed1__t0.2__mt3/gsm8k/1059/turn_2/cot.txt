To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of cat food fed per day**:
   Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time. Therefore, the total amount of cat food fed per day is:
   \[
   \text{Total food per day} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many days the cat food will last**:
   We have a total of 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food consumed per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, the 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

Final answer: **6 days**.
