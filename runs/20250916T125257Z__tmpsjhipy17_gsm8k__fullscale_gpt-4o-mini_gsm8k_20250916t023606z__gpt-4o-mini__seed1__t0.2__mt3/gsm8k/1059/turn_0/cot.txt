To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of cat food fed to the cats per day.**
   - Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time.
   - Therefore, the total amount of food fed to the cats in one day is:
     \[
     \text{Total food per day} = \text{Food per feeding} \times \text{Number of feedings per day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total food per day} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Determine how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last.**
   - To find out how many days the food will last, we divide the total amount of cat food by the amount of food consumed per day:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Total food per day}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.
