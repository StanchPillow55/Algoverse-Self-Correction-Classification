To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, given that she feeds them twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Cat Food Consumption
Imma feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding totals 60 grams. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by the cats in one day is:

\[
\text{Daily consumption} = \text{Feeding amount per day} = 60 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Days the Cat Food Will Last
Now, we need to find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We can do this by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Daily consumption}} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{60 \text{ grams/day}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Division
Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{720}{60} = 12
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, 720 grams of cat food will last for 12 days.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
