To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost of repaving both Monica's street and Lewis' street, and then find the difference in cost between the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street.

Monica's street is 150 meters long, and the cost to repave is $194 per meter. 

The formula to calculate the total cost is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Length of the street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
\]

For Monica's street:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Monica} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
150 \times 194 = 29100
\]

Thus, the cost to repave Monica's street is:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Monica} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and the cost to repave is still $194 per meter.

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Lewis} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
490 \times 194 = 95060
\]

Thus, the cost to repave Lewis' street is:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Lewis} = 95060 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we subtract the cost of Monica's street from the cost of Lewis' street:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost for Lewis} - \text{Total Cost for Monica}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 95060 - 29100
\]

Now, we perform the subtraction:
\[
95060 - 29100 = 65960
\]

### Final Answer

The difference in cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is:
\[
\boxed{65960} \, \text{dollars}
\]
