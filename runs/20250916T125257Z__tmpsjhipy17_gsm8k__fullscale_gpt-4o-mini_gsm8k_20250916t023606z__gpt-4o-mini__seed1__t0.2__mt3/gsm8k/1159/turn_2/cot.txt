To solve the problem, we start by determining how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing in purple**:
   - Carla dresses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets in purple.
   - Number of purple-wearers: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]

3. **Dressing in blue**:
   - The remaining \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in blue.
   - Number of blue-wearers: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
     \]

Now we know:
- Purple-wearers: 6
- Blue-wearers: 2

4. **Bows**:
   - All blue-wearers wear bows: 2 blue-wearers.
   - 1/3 of the purple-wearers wear bows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ purple-wearers}
     \]

5. **Total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - Total wearing bows = blue-wearers + purple-wearers wearing bows:
     \[
     2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

6. **Calculating the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The number of babies wearing bows that are purple is 2.
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.
   - The probability (or percentage chance) that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To express this as a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50\%}
\]
