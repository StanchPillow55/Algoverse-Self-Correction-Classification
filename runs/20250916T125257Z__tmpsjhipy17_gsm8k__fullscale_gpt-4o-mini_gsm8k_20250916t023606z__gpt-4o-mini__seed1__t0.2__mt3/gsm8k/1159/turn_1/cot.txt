To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of octuplets**: 
   Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2. **Calculate how many are dressed in purple and blue**:
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in purple. 
   - To find the number of octuplets in purple:
     \[
     \text{Number in purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - The remaining octuplets are dressed in blue. Since there are 8 octuplets in total:
     \[
     \text{Number in blue} = 8 - 6 = 2
     \]

3. **Determine how many wear bows**:
   - The problem states that all the blue-wearers wear bows. Since there are 2 blue-wearers:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-wearers with bows} = 2
     \]
   - It also states that \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows. Since there are 6 purple-wearers:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple-wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of blue-wearers with bows and purple-wearers with bows:
     \[
     \text{Total wearing bows} = 2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

5. **Determine the number of babies wearing purple that are also wearing bows**:
   - From the previous calculation, we found that 2 purple-wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     P(\text{purple} | \text{wearing bow}) = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To express this as a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that there is a **50% chance** that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
