To solve the problem, we start by determining how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: Carla has 8 octuplets.

2. **Dressing in purple**: 
   - Carla dresses \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets in purple.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 octuplets are dressed in purple.

3. **Dressing in blue**: 
   - The remaining octuplets are dressed in blue.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     8 - 6 = 2
     \]
   - So, 2 octuplets are dressed in blue.

4. **Bows worn by blue-wearers**: 
   - All the blue-wearers wear bows.
   - Therefore, the number of blue-wearers wearing bows is:
     \[
     2
     \]

5. **Bows worn by purple-wearers**: 
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers wear bows.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]
   - So, 2 purple-wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Total number of babies wearing bows**: 
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is the sum of the blue-wearers and the purple-wearers wearing bows.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4
     \]

7. **Percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**: 
   - We need to find the proportion of babies wearing bows that are purple-wearers.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers wearing bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - To convert this to a percentage:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \).
