To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day over the week, we first need to calculate the total number of birds he saw during the week and then divide that by the number of days (which is 7).

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Days 1 and 2**: Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
2. **Day 3**: Mack saw 0 birds.
3. **Days 4 and 5**: Mack saw a total of 120 birds.
4. **Day 6**: Mack saw 20 birds.
5. **Day 7**: Mack saw 90 birds.

Now, we will sum the number of birds seen each day:

- **Days 1 and 2**: 50 birds
- **Day 3**: 0 birds
- **Days 4 and 5**: 120 birds
- **Day 6**: 20 birds
- **Day 7**: 90 birds

Now we can calculate the total number of birds seen over the week:

\[
\text{Total birds} = \text{Birds on Days 1 and 2} + \text{Birds on Day 3} + \text{Birds on Days 4 and 5} + \text{Birds on Day 6} + \text{Birds on Day 7}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
\]

Now we perform the addition step by step:

1. \(50 + 0 = 50\)
2. \(50 + 120 = 170\)
3. \(170 + 20 = 190\)
4. \(190 + 90 = 280\)

So, the total number of birds Mack saw over the week is:

\[
\text{Total birds} = 280
\]

Next, we calculate the average number of birds seen per day. The average is calculated by dividing the total number of birds by the number of days:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total birds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{280}{7}
\]

Now we perform the division:

\[
\frac{280}{7} = 40
\]

Thus, the average number of birds Mack saw in a day is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]
