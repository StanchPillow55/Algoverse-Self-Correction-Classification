To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Mark earns in a week from both publishers.

1. **Identify the payment rates**:
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of sentences edited**:
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week.
   - Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, we divide the total sentences by 2:
     \[
     \text{Sentences for Publisher A} = \text{Sentences for Publisher B} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]

3. **Calculate earnings from each publisher**:
   - **Earnings from Publisher A**:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - **Earnings from Publisher B**:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings**:
   - To find Mark's total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]
