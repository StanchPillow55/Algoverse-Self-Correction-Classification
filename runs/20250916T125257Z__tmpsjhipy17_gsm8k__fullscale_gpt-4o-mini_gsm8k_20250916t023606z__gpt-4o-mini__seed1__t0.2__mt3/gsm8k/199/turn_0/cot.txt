To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of sentences edited for each publisher**:
   Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Therefore, the number of sentences he edits for each publisher is:
   \[
   \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{\text{Total sentences}}{2} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
   \]

2. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher A**:
   According to the problem, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.

3. **Calculate the total earnings from Publisher A**:
   To find out how much Mark earns from Publisher A, we multiply the number of sentences he edits for Publisher A by the payment rate:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Sentences edited for A} \times \text{Rate per sentence for A}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = 500 \times 5 = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Determine the payment rate for Publisher B**:
   The problem states that Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Since Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence, Publisher B pays:
   \[
   \text{Rate per sentence for B} = 2 \times \text{Rate per sentence for A} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total earnings from Publisher B**:
   Similarly, we calculate how much Mark earns from Publisher B:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Sentences edited for B} \times \text{Rate per sentence for B}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 500 \times 10 = 5000 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total earnings for the week**:
   Finally, we add the earnings from both publishers to find Mark's total earnings for the week:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
   \]

Thus, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

**Final Answer**: 7500 cents
