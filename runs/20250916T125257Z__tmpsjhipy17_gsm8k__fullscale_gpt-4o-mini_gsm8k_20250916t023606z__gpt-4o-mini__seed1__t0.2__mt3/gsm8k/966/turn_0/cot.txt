To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of brownies Greta had and how many were consumed during the day.

1. **Brownies Greta made for herself:**
   - Greta made 1 dozen brownies.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, she made:
     \[
     12 \text{ brownies}
     \]

2. **Brownies from the office party:**
   - Greta received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office party.
   - Since 1/2 dozen equals 6, she received:
     \[
     6 \text{ brownies}
     \]

3. **Brownies from her friends' surprise party:**
   - Greta's friends brought her 4 dozen brownies.
   - Since 4 dozen equals 48, she received:
     \[
     48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   - We will now add the brownies Greta made, the ones she received from the office, and the ones from her friends:
     \[
     12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
     \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   - During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   - Since 1 1/2 dozen equals 12 + 6 = 18, the number of brownies eaten is:
     \[
     18 \text{ brownies}
     \]

6. **Calculating brownies left over:**
   - To find out how many brownies Greta had left after the party, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had:
     \[
     66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Greta has **48 individual brownies left over from the entire day**.
