To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the prices of each type of bike:**
   - Price of one MTB = $500
   - Price of one BMX = half the price of an MTB = $500 / 2 = $250
   - Price of one Trekking bike = $450

2. **Determine the total number of bikes sold:**
   - Total bikes sold = 300

3. **Calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold:**
   - Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of Trekking bikes} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of BMX bikes sold:**
   - 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes.
   \[
   \text{Number of BMX bikes} = 0.15 \times 300 = 45
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of MTB bikes sold:**
   - The rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes. We can find this by subtracting the number of Trekking and BMX bikes from the total.
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (\text{Number of Trekking bikes} + \text{Number of BMX bikes})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of MTB bikes} = 300 - (150 + 45) = 300 - 195 = 105
   \]

6. **Calculate the earnings from each type of bike:**
   - Earnings from MTB bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB} = \text{Number of MTB bikes} \times \text{Price of MTB}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from MTB} = 105 \times 500 = 52500
   \]

   - Earnings from BMX bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX} = \text{Number of BMX bikes} \times \text{Price of BMX}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from BMX} = 45 \times 250 = 11250
   \]

   - Earnings from Trekking bikes:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking} = \text{Number of Trekking bikes} \times \text{Price of Trekking}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from Trekking} = 150 \times 450 = 67500
   \]

7. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from MTB} + \text{Earnings from BMX} + \text{Earnings from Trekking}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 52500 + 11250 + 67500 = 131250
   \]

Thus, Marcel earned a total of **$131,250** from selling bicycles during that month.

Final answer: **$131,250**
