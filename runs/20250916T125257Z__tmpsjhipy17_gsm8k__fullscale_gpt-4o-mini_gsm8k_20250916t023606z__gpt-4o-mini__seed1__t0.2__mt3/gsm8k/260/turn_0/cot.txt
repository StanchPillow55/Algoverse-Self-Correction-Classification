To determine how many cups of flour Carla will need to bake cookies today and tomorrow, we can break the problem down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the flour needed for one dozen cookies.
According to the problem, 2 cups of flour are needed to make 12 cookies.

### Step 2: Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies (today).
First, we need to find out how many dozens are in 36 cookies:
\[
\text{Number of dozens in 36 cookies} = \frac{36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 3 \text{ dozens}
\]

Now, since each dozen requires 2 cups of flour, we can calculate the total flour needed for 3 dozens:
\[
\text{Flour needed for 36 cookies} = 3 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies (tomorrow).
Next, we find out how many dozens are in 30 cookies:
\[
\text{Number of dozens in 30 cookies} = \frac{30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 2.5 \text{ dozens}
\]

Now, we calculate the total flour needed for 2.5 dozens:
\[
\text{Flour needed for 30 cookies} = 2.5 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 5 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total flour needed for both days.
Now we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow:
\[
\text{Total flour needed} = \text{Flour for 36 cookies} + \text{Flour for 30 cookies} = 6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

### Final Answer:
Carla will need a total of **11 cups of flour** to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.
