To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run**:
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Hannah is required to run 8 laps.
   - To find the total distance, we multiply the number of laps by the distance of each lap:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water needed for the total distance**:
   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
   - Since we calculated that she will run a total of 2 km, we can find the total amount of water needed by multiplying the distance by the amount of water per kilometer:
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per km} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = 120 \text{ ml}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Hannah will need to drink **120 ml** of water for her run.

In conclusion, after calculating the total distance she will run and the corresponding amount of water needed, we find that Hannah needs to drink **120 ml** of water.
