To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run**: 
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Hannah is required to run 8 laps.
   - Therefore, the total distance in kilometers is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 8 \, \text{laps} \times 0.25 \, \text{km/lap} = 2 \, \text{km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water needed**:
   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
   - Now we can calculate the total amount of water she needs for the total distance she will run:

   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per kilometer}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 2 \, \text{km} \times 60 \, \text{ml/km} = 120 \, \text{ml}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is:

   \[
   \boxed{120 \, \text{ml}}
   \] 

This means Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water after running 8 laps of 0.25 km each.
