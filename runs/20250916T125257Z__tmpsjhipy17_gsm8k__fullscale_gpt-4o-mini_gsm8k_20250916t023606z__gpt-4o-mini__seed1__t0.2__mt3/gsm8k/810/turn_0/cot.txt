To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students are on campus at the end of May, given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

### Step 1: Understand the Doubling Process
We start with 10 students at the beginning of January. The number of students doubles at the end of each month. We will calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May.

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Students Each Month
1. **End of January**:
   \[
   \text{Students at end of January} = 10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

2. **End of February**:
   \[
   \text{Students at end of February} = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]

3. **End of March**:
   \[
   \text{Students at end of March} = 40 \times 2 = 80
   \]

4. **End of April**:
   \[
   \text{Students at end of April} = 80 \times 2 = 160
   \]

5. **End of May**:
   \[
   \text{Students at end of May} = 160 \times 2 = 320
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Additional Students
Now we need to find out how many additional students joined by the end of May compared to the initial number of students at the beginning of the year.

- **Initial number of students**: 10
- **Number of students at the end of May**: 320

To find the additional students:
\[
\text{Additional students} = \text{Students at end of May} - \text{Initial students}
\]
\[
\text{Additional students} = 320 - 10 = 310
\]

### Final Answer
The number of additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is **310**.
