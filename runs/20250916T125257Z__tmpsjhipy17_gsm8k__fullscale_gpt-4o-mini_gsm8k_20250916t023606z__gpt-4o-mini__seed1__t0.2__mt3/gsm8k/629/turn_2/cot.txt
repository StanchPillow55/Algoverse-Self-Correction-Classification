To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue from selling the cars.**
   James sold 10 cars at a price of $25,000 each. Therefore, the total sales revenue is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to acquire the cars.**
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. First, we need to find the cost of acquiring one car:

   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \times \text{Price per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]

   Now, we can find the total cost for all 10 cars:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit from selling the cars.**
   Profit is calculated as the total sales revenue minus the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Sales Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit.**
   James receives a 10% commission on the total profit. Therefore, we calculate his commission as follows:

   \[
   \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \text{Total Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 17,500
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   James made a total of **$17,500** from his commission on the sales of the cars.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{17,500}
\]
