To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**
   James sold 10 cars at a price of $25,000 each. Therefore, the total revenue from the sales is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars.**
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. We first calculate the cost for one car and then for all 10 cars:

   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \times \text{Price per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit from the sales.**
   Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit.**
   James earns a 10% commission on the total profit. We calculate his commission as follows:

   \[
   \text{Commission} = 10\% \times \text{Total Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 17,500
   \]

5. **Final answer.**
   Therefore, the total amount James made from his commission on the sales is:

   \[
   \text{James's Earnings} = 17,500
   \]

Thus, James made **$17,500** from selling the cars.
