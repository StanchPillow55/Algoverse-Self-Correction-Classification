To determine how many pages are in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the thickness of the book**: The book is stated to be 1.5 inches thick.

2. **Know the number of pages per inch**: It is given that there are 100 pages per inch.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages**: Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages for every inch, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the thickness by the number of pages per inch.

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness of the book (in inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: Since each sheet of paper has two pages (one on each side), the total number of pages in the book is 150.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
