To determine how many pages are in the book, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the thickness of the book**: The book is stated to be 1.5 inches thick.

2. **Know the pages per inch**: It is given that there are 100 pages to the inch.

3. **Calculate the total number of pages**: Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages for every inch, we can calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch.

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness of the book (in inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch}
   \]

   Now, perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \times 100 = 150
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The total number of pages in the book is 150.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
