To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue the hospital earns from the patients and the total cost the hospital incurs for the doctors' services. 

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue from Patients

1. **Number of Patients per Day**: 500 patients
2. **Charge per Patient**: $200 per hour
3. **Average Time per Patient**: 24 minutes

First, we need to convert the average time per patient from minutes to hours:
\[
\text{Average Time in Hours} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated from each patient:
\[
\text{Revenue per Patient} = \text{Charge per Patient} \times \text{Average Time in Hours} = 200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from all patients:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Revenue per Patient} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 80 \text{ dollars} = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost for Doctors

1. **Charge per Hour for Doctors**: $150
2. **Total Time Spent by All Patients**: Since each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we can calculate the total time for all patients:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Average Time in Hours} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total cost for the doctors:
\[
\text{Total Cost for Doctors} = \text{Total Time} \times \text{Charge per Hour for Doctors} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Profit

Finally, we can calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost for Doctors} = 40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.
