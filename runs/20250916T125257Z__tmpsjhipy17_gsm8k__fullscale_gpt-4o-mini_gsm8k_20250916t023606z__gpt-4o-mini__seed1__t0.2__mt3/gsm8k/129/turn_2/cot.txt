To find the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue generated from the patients and the total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors' services.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patients per day

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Since there are 500 patients per day, we can calculate the total time spent on all patients:

\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = 500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert total time to hours

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:

\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{12000 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from patients

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from the patients can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for doctors

Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. The total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40000 \text{ dollars} - 30000 \text{ dollars} = 10000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.
