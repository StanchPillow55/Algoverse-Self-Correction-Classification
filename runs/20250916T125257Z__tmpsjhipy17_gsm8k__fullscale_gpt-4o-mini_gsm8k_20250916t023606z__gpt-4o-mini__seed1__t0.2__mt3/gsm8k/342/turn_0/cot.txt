To find out how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Outfits from her friend**: Laurel received 24 baby outfits from her friend.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from friend} = 24
   \]

2. **Outfits from her baby shower**: Laurel received twice the amount of outfits from her friend at her baby shower. To find out how many outfits she received at the baby shower, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Outfits from baby shower} = 2 \times \text{Outfits from friend} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Outfits from her mom**: Laurel's mom gifted her an additional 15 baby outfits.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from mom} = 15
   \]

4. **Total outfits**: Now, we will add all the outfits together to find the total number of outfits Laurel has:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = \text{Outfits from friend} + \text{Outfits from baby shower} + \text{Outfits from mom}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = 24 + 48 + 15
   \]

5. **Performing the addition**:
   - First, add the outfits from the friend and the baby shower:
     \[
     24 + 48 = 72
     \]
   - Next, add the outfits from her mom:
     \[
     72 + 15 = 87
     \]

Thus, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:
\[
\text{Total outfits} = 87
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{87}
\]
