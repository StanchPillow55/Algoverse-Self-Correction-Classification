To find the final temperature of Marcus's house after he bakes and then opens a window, we will break the problem down into steps.

1. **Initial Temperature**: 
   The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.

2. **Temperature Increase from Baking**:
   Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and the oven raises the temperature by 5 degrees for each hour it is on. 
   - The total increase in temperature from baking can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Temperature increase} = \text{hours} \times \text{increase per hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 5 \, \text{degrees/hour} = 15 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

3. **New Temperature After Baking**:
   We add the temperature increase from baking to the initial temperature:
   \[
   \text{New temperature} = \text{Initial temperature} + \text{Temperature increase} = 40 \, \text{degrees} + 15 \, \text{degrees} = 55 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

4. **Cooling from Opening the Window**:
   After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.
   - First, we determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes:
     \[
     \text{Number of intervals} = \frac{30 \, \text{minutes}}{10 \, \text{minutes/interval}} = 3 \, \text{intervals}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the total cooling effect:
     \[
     \text{Total cooling} = \text{Number of intervals} \times \text{cooling per interval} = 3 \, \text{intervals} \times 2 \, \text{degrees/interval} = 6 \, \text{degrees}
     \]

5. **Final Temperature After Cooling**:
   We subtract the total cooling from the temperature after baking:
   \[
   \text{Final temperature} = \text{New temperature} - \text{Total cooling} = 55 \, \text{degrees} - 6 \, \text{degrees} = 49 \, \text{degrees}
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of Marcus's house after baking and then opening the window is:

\[
\boxed{49 \, \text{degrees}}
\]
