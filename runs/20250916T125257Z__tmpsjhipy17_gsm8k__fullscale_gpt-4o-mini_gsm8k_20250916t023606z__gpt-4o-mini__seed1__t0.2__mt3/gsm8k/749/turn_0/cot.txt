To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are needed to accommodate all 54 students when the activity requires 12 groups.

### Step 1: Determine the size of each group
First, we need to find out how many students can be in each group if we were to separate all 54 students into 12 groups.

To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

Since we cannot have half a student in a group, this means that 12 groups cannot accommodate all 54 students evenly. 

### Step 2: Determine the number of groups needed for equal distribution
Next, we need to find out how many groups are required to accommodate all 54 students if each group must have an equal number of students.

To find the number of groups needed, we can divide the total number of students by the maximum number of students we want in each group. Since we want equal groups, we can assume a reasonable group size. 

Let's assume we want each group to have 9 students (a common group size). We can calculate the number of groups needed:

\[
\text{Number of groups needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Size of each group}} = \frac{54}{9}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{9} = 6
\]

### Step 3: Compare the required number of groups with the existing number of groups
The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. We have calculated that we need 6 groups to accommodate all 54 students if each group has 9 students.

Now, we need to find out how many more groups are needed:

\[
\text{More groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Existing groups} = 12 - 6
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
12 - 6 = 6
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of additional groups needed to form is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
