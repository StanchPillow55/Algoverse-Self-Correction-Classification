To solve the problem, we need to determine how many groups are needed to accommodate fifty-four students when they are to be separated into groups of equal size. 

1. **Determine the size of each group**: 
   We have 54 students and we want to separate them into 6 groups of equal size. To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

   \[
   \text{Size of each group} = \frac{54 \text{ students}}{6 \text{ groups}} = 9 \text{ students per group}
   \]

2. **Identify the requirement for groups**: 
   The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. 

3. **Calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated in 12 groups**: 
   If we have 12 groups and each group can hold 9 students, we can calculate the total number of students that can be accommodated:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of 12 groups} = 12 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ students per group} = 108 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Determine the difference in the number of groups needed**: 
   Since we already have 6 groups and we need a total of 12 groups, we can find out how many more groups are needed:

   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = 12 \text{ groups} - 6 \text{ groups} = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form is:

   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \] 

This means that to accommodate all students in the activity, 6 more groups need to be formed.
