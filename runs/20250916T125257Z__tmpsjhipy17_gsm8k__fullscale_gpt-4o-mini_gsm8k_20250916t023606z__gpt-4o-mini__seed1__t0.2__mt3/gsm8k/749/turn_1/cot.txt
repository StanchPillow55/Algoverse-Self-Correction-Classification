To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more groups are needed if the activity requires 12 groups, given that there are 54 students to be separated into groups of equal size.

### Step 1: Determine the size of each group with the current setup

First, we need to find out how many students will be in each group if we separate 54 students into 6 groups.

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]

So, if we create 6 groups, each group will have 9 students.

### Step 2: Determine the size of each group if 12 groups are formed

Next, we need to find out how many students would be in each group if we were to form 12 groups instead.

\[
\text{Size of each group} = \frac{54}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
\]

This means that if we were to form 12 groups, each group would have 4.5 students, which is not possible since we cannot have half a student in a group.

### Step 3: Determine how many groups can be formed with whole students

Since we cannot have half students in a group, we need to find out how many complete groups can be formed with whole students. 

To find the maximum number of groups that can be formed with whole students, we can divide the total number of students by the maximum number of students per group (which we can assume to be 9, as calculated earlier).

\[
\text{Maximum number of groups} = \frac{54}{9} = 6
\]

This confirms that we can form 6 groups of 9 students each.

### Step 4: Calculate how many more groups are needed

The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. Since we can only form 6 groups with the available students, we need to find out how many more groups are needed.

\[
\text{Additional groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Current groups} = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of additional groups needed to meet the requirement of 12 groups is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
