To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - She is 40% of the way through the download when the restart occurs.
   - The total size of the file is 200 GB.
   - To find out how much of the file she has downloaded before the restart, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Downloaded before restart} = 200 \, \text{GB} \times 0.40 = 80 \, \text{GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB:**
   - Since Carla downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we can find the time taken to download 80 GB using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Download rate}} = \frac{80 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 40 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the restart time:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent before restarting the download is:
     \[
     \text{Total time before restart} = 40 \, \text{minutes} + 20 \, \text{minutes} = 60 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine how much of the file is left to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning, and she still needs to download the remaining part of the file:
     \[
     \text{Remaining file} = 200 \, \text{GB} - 80 \, \text{GB} = 120 \, \text{GB}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   - Again, using the download rate of 2 GB/minute, we find the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{120 \, \text{GB}}{2 \, \text{GB/min}} = 60 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire download:**
   - The total time taken to download the file includes the time before the restart and the time after the restart:
     \[
     \text{Total download time} = 60 \, \text{minutes} + 60 \, \text{minutes} = 120 \, \text{minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file is **120 minutes**.

Final answer: **120 minutes**.
