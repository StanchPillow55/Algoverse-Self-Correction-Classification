To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the time taken for each part of the download process.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
   - She can download at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - 40% of the way through the download means she has downloaded:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download the first 80 GB:**
   - The time taken to download 80 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the forced restart:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. 

4. **Calculate the total time spent before restarting the download:**
   - Total time before restarting the download is:
     \[
     40 \text{ minutes (download)} + 20 \text{ minutes (restart)} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine the remaining file size to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. Therefore, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file again.

6. **Calculate the time taken to download the entire file again:**
   - The time taken to download the full 200 GB at a rate of 2 GB/minute is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time for the entire download process:**
   - The total time for the entire download process, including the initial download and the restart, is:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (before restart)} + 100 \text{ minutes (restart download)} = 160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Carla to download the file is:

\[
\boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
\]
