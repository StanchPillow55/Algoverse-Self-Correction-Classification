To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how much of the file is downloaded before the restart:**
   - Carla is downloading a 200 GB file at a rate of 2 GB/minute.
   - She gets 40% of the way through the download before the restart.
   - To find out how much of the file that is, we calculate:
     \[
     0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB:**
   - Since she downloads at a rate of 2 GB/minute, we can find the time taken to download 80 GB:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Amount downloaded}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Account for the restart time:**
   - After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. So, we add this time to the total time:
     \[
     \text{Total time so far} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine how much of the file is left to download:**
   - After the restart, Carla has 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB left to download.

5. **Calculate the time taken to download the remaining 120 GB:**
   - Again, using the download rate of 2 GB/minute:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total time for the entire download:**
   - Now we add the time taken before the restart and the time taken after the restart:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes (before restart)} + 60 \text{ minutes (after restart)} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes to download the file is:

\[
\boxed{120 \text{ minutes}}
\]
