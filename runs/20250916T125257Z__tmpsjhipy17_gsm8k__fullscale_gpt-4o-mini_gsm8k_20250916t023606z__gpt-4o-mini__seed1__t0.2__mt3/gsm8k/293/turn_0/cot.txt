To solve the problem, we will first determine the points for each player after the first three rounds, and then we will account for the extra points awarded in the fourth round.

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike. Therefore, Jim's points are:
     \[
     \text{Jim's points} = 21 - 3 = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Therefore, Tony's points are:
     \[
     \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
     \]

2. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he receives an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Mike's new points} = 21 + 1 = 22
     \]
   - Jim has 18 points, which is not over 20, so he does not receive an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Jim's new points} = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 42 points, which is over 20, so he receives an extra point:
     \[
     \text{Tony's new points} = 42 + 1 = 43
     \]

3. **Calculating the total points after the fourth round:**
   - Now we will sum the points of all three players:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Mike's new points} + \text{Jim's new points} + \text{Tony's new points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 22 + 18 + 43
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 83
     \]

Thus, the total points that all three players have after the extra points have been distributed is \( \boxed{83} \).
