To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family is using when the power goes out. We'll break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights

1. **Flashlights for each person**: There are 4 people in the house, and each person has one flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the people is:
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for people} = 4 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ flashlight/person} = 4 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

2. **Flashlights for each room**: There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:
   \[
   \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights/room} = 16 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

3. **Total flashlights**: Now, we add the flashlights for the people and the rooms together:
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights for people} + \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candles

1. **Small candles**: Half of the rooms have 4 small candles each. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms with small candles} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ rooms}
   \]
   Therefore, the total number of small candles is:
   \[
   \text{Small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
   \]

2. **Medium candles**: The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each. The number of rooms with medium candles is also 4 (the other half of the 8 rooms). Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:
   \[
   \text{Medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
   \]

3. **Total candles**: Now, we add the small and medium candles together:
   \[
   \text{Total candles} = \text{Small candles} + \text{Medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ candles}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of items (candles and flashlights)

Now that we have the total number of flashlights and candles, we can find the overall total:
\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 20 + 36 = 56
\]

### Final Answer

Brianna's family is using a total of **56** candles and flashlights when the lights go out.
