To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family is using when the power goes out. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights

Brianna's family consists of 4 people, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Number of people} = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flashlights in the rooms

There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights in the rooms is:

\[
\text{Flashlights in rooms} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Flashlights per room} = 8 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of flashlights

Now we can find the total number of flashlights by adding the flashlights carried by the people and the flashlights in the rooms:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights carried by people} + \text{Flashlights in rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of candles

Next, we need to calculate the total number of candles. The problem states that there are two types of rooms: half of the rooms have small candles and the other half have medium candles.

1. **Small candles**: Half of the 8 rooms means 4 rooms have small candles. Each of these rooms has 4 small candles. Therefore, the total number of small candles is:

\[
\text{Total small candles} = \text{Number of small candle rooms} \times \text{Small candles per room} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

2. **Medium candles**: The other half of the rooms (also 4 rooms) have medium candles. Each of these rooms has 5 medium candles. Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:

\[
\text{Total medium candles} = \text{Number of medium candle rooms} \times \text{Medium candles per room} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of candles

Now we can find the total number of candles by adding the small candles and the medium candles:

\[
\text{Total candles} = \text{Total small candles} + \text{Total medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of items (candles and flashlights)

Finally, we can find the total number of items (candles and flashlights) that Brianna's family is using:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 20 + 36 = 56
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]
