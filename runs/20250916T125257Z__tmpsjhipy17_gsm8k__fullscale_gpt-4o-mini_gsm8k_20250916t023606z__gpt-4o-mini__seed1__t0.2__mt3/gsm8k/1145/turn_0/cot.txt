To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold over the course of 3 days. We will break down the information given and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of sunflowers sold from the sunflower sales.

Faraday sells sunflowers for $2 each and earned $26 from selling sunflowers. To find out how many individual sunflowers he sold, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
\]

So, Faraday sold 13 sunflowers in one day.

### Step 2: Determine the number of bouquets sold.

Next, we know that Faraday sells bouquets for $8 each and earned $56 from selling bouquets. To find out how many bouquets he sold, we use a similar formula:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of bouquets sold} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
\]

So, Faraday sold 7 bouquets in one day.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets.

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets sold} \times \text{Number of sunflowers per bouquet}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in one day.

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by adding the number of individual sunflowers sold and the number of sunflowers sold from bouquets:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold} + \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days.

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by 3:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} \times 3
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:

\[
\boxed{291}
\]
