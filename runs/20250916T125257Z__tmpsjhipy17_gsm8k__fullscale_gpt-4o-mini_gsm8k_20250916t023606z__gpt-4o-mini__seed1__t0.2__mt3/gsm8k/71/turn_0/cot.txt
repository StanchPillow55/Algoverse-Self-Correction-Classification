To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare two dishes, given the number of instructions for each recipe.

1. **Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe:**
   - The first recipe has 20 instructions.

2. **Determine the number of instructions in the second recipe:**
   - The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one.
   - Therefore, the number of instructions in the second recipe is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ instructions}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of instructions for both recipes:**
   - To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read, we add the number of instructions from both recipes:
     \[
     \text{Total instructions} = \text{Instructions from first recipe} + \text{Instructions from second recipe}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total instructions} = 20 + 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes is:
     \[
     \boxed{60}
     \]
