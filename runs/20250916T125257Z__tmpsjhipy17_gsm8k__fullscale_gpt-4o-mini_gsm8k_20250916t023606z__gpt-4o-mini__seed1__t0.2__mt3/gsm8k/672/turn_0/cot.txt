To solve the problem, we need to analyze Christina's mood records over the past thirty days step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of days**: Christina recorded her mood for 30 days.

2. **Count the types of days**:
   - Good days: 12
   - Bad days: 8
   - Neutral days: To find the number of neutral days, we can use the total days minus the sum of good and bad days.

   \[
   \text{Neutral days} = \text{Total days} - (\text{Good days} + \text{Bad days}) = 30 - (12 + 8) = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

   So, Christina had 10 neutral days.

3. **Mood distribution**:
   - First 8 days: All good (8 good days)
   - Next 8 days: All bad (8 bad days)
   - Next 8 days: All neutral (8 neutral days)

   After these 24 days, we can summarize:
   - Good days: 8 (from the first 8 days)
   - Bad days: 8 (from the second 8 days)
   - Neutral days: 8 (from the third 8 days)

4. **Remaining days**: After the first 24 days, there are 6 days left in the month (30 - 24 = 6).

5. **Mood for the next 3 days**: The problem states that the next three days were good, neutral, and good. We can summarize these three days:
   - Day 25: Good
   - Day 26: Neutral
   - Day 27: Good

   This means:
   - Good days: 2 (from the last three days)
   - Neutral days: 1 (from the last three days)

6. **Total good days**: Now we can calculate the total number of good days:
   - Good days from the first 24 days: 8
   - Good days from the last three days: 2

   \[
   \text{Total good days} = 8 + 2 = 10
   \]

7. **Remaining good days**: We know Christina initially had 12 good days. To find out how many good days are left in the month, we subtract the total good days from the initial count of good days:

   \[
   \text{Good days left} = \text{Initial good days} - \text{Total good days} = 12 - 10 = 2
   \]

Thus, the number of good days left in the month is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
