To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we will first calculate the total time he spends on lunches and breaks in one day, and then multiply that by 5 days.

### Step 1: Calculate daily break and lunch time

1. **Lunch time**: Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch each day.
   \[
   \text{Lunch time per day} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Break time**: Bobby takes 2 breaks of 15 minutes each day.
   \[
   \text{Break time per day} = 2 \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Total time per day**: Now, we add the lunch time and break time together to find the total time spent on lunches and breaks in one day.
   \[
   \text{Total time per day} = \text{Lunch time} + \text{Break time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate total time over 5 days

Now that we know Bobby spends 60 minutes on lunches and breaks each day, we will calculate the total time over 5 days.
\[
\text{Total time over 5 days} = 60 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Convert minutes to hours

To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

After 5 days, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to a total of **5 hours**.
