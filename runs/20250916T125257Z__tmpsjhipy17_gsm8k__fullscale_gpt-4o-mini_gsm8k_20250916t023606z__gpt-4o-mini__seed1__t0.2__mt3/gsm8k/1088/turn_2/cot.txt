To find out how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the weekdays:**
   - John has 6 regular periods and 2 extra classes each day.
   - Total classes per day = 6 + 2 = 8 classes.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long.
   - Total class time per day = 8 classes × 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total class time for the week:**
   - John goes to class for 5 days a week.
   - Total class time for the week = 320 minutes/day × 5 days = 1600 minutes.

3. **Calculate the total minutes in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total minutes in a week = 7 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 10080 minutes.

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
   - Extra learning time for the weekend = (1/16) × 10080 minutes = 630 minutes.
   - Since this is for both Saturday and Sunday, we divide it by 2 to find the extra learning time per day:
     - Extra learning time per day = 630 minutes ÷ 2 = 315 minutes.

5. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Total learning time for the week = Total class time for the week + Extra learning time for the weekend.
   - Total learning time for the week = 1600 minutes + 630 minutes = 2230 minutes.

6. **Convert total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
   - Total learning time in hours = 2230 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour ≈ 37.1667 hours.

7. **Final answer:**
   - Rounding to two decimal places, John spends approximately **37.17 hours** a week learning.

Thus, the final answer is:
**37.17 hours**.
