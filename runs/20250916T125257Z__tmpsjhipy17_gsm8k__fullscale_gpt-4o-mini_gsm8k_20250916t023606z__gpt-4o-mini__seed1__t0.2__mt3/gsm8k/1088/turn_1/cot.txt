To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total class time during the week

1. **Normal Class Periods**: John has 6 periods in a day.
2. **Extra Classes**: John takes 2 extra classes.
3. **Total Classes per Day**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Classes} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Duration of Each Class**: Each class is 40 minutes long.
5. **Total Class Time per Day**:
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Day} = 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes}
   \]
6. **Days per Week**: John goes to class for 5 days a week.
7. **Total Class Time per Week**:
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend

1. **Total Minutes in a Week**: There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours, so:
   \[
   \text{Total Minutes in a Week} = 7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes}
   \]
2. **Extra Learning Time on Saturday and Sunday**: John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
3. **Extra Learning Time Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Extra Learning Time per Day} = \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. **Total Extra Learning Time for the Weekend**:
   \[
   \text{Total Extra Learning Time} = 630 \text{ minutes (Saturday)} + 630 \text{ minutes (Sunday)} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total learning time for the week

1. **Total Learning Time**:
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = \text{Total Class Time per Week} + \text{Total Extra Learning Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 1260 \text{ minutes} = 2860 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert total learning time from minutes to hours

1. **Convert Minutes to Hours**:
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time in Hours} = \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \approx 47.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]
   This can be expressed as:
   \[
   47 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Final Answer

John spends approximately **47.67 hours** (or 47 hours and 40 minutes) learning each week.
