To determine the salesman's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost per sneaker**:
   The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. To find the cost per sneaker, we divide the total cost by the number of sneakers:
   \[
   \text{Cost per sneaker} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of sneakers}} = \frac{576}{48} = 12 \text{ dollars per sneaker}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from the flash sale**:
   The salesman sold 17 sneakers for $20 each during the flash sale. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from flash sale} = 17 \times 20 = 340 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how many sneakers were sold to the department store**:
   The total number of sneakers is 48, and the salesman sold 17 of them at the flash sale. Therefore, the number of sneakers sold to the department store is:
   \[
   \text{Sneakers sold to department store} = 48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from the department store**:
   The salesman sold the remaining 31 sneakers to the department store for $25 each. To find the total revenue from this sale, we multiply the number of sneakers sold by the price per sneaker:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from department store} = 31 \times 25 = 775 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue from all sales**:
   Now, we add the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store to find the total revenue:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from flash sale} + \text{Revenue from department store} = 340 + 775 = 1115 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost**:
   The total cost of the sneakers was $576, as given in the problem.

7. **Calculate the profit**:
   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 1115 - 576 = 539 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars.
