To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of pink and white flamingos throughout the weekend.

1. **Initial Setup (Friday Morning)**:
   - The neighbors placed **18 pink flamingos** in Sue's front yard.
   - At this point, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: **18**
     - White flamingos: **0**

2. **Saturday Morning**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
     \[
     \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, they took back **6 pink flamingos**.
   - After taking back the flamingos, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
     - White flamingos: **6** (the 6 flamingos that were painted white)

3. **Sunday Morning**:
   - The neighbors added another **18 pink flamingos** to the collection.
   - Now we update the counts:
     - Pink flamingos: \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)
     - White flamingos: **6** (no change here)

4. **Final Calculation (Noon on Sunday)**:
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
   - The difference is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of pink flamingos} - \text{Number of white flamingos} = 30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are **24 more pink plastic flamingos** than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer**: 24
