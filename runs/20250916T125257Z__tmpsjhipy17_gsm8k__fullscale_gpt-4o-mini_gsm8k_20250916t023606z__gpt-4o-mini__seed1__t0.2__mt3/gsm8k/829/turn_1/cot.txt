To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week after knowing his production for the first three weeks.

1. **Production in the First Week**: 
   Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

2. **Production in the Second Week**: 
   In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. 
   \[
   \text{Production in the second week} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Production in the Third Week**: 
   In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. 
   \[
   \text{Production in the third week} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total production in three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**: 
   Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. To find out how many bars he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
   \[
   \text{Production in the fourth week} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is:

\[
\boxed{14,000}
\]
