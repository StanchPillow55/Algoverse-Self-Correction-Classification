To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week, given the production amounts for the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (First Three Weeks)} = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

**Final Answer**: 14,000 bars
