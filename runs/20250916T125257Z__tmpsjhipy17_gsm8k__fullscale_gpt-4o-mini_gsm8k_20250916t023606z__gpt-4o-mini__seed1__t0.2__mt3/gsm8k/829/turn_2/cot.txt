To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week based on the production in the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = \text{First Week} + \text{Second Week} + \text{Third Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. Since we have the total production for the first three weeks, we can find out how much he has left to produce in the fourth week.
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = \text{Total Monthly Production} - \text{Total Production for First Three Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

**Final Answer**: 14,000 bars.
