To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for in order to reach his goal of making a total of $135.

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling eggplants:**
   Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. We can calculate the total revenue from the eggplants as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue from eggplants} = \text{Number of eggplants} \times \text{Price per eggplant}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

   So, Bennet makes $60 from selling the eggplants.

2. **Determine how much more money Bennet needs to reach his goal:**
   Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We need to find out how much more he needs after selling the eggplants:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed from corn} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Total revenue from eggplants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed from corn} = 135 - 60 = 75
   \]

   Bennet needs to make $75 from selling the ears of corn.

3. **Calculate the price per ear of corn:**
   Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the amount he needs to make from corn by the number of ears of corn:

   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\text{Amount needed from corn}}{\text{Number of ears of corn}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{75}{25} = 3
   \]

   Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

4. **Final answer:**
   Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.
