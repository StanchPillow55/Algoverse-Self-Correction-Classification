To determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial quantities of glasses and plates.**
2. **Determine how many were broken.**
3. **Subtract the broken items from the initial quantities.**
4. **State the final quantities of glasses and plates.**

### Step 1: Calculate the initial quantities

Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates. 

- **Glasses:**
  \[
  8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Plates:**
  \[
  4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine how many were broken

According to the problem, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

### Step 3: Subtract the broken items from the initial quantities

- **Remaining glasses:**
  \[
  96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
  \]

- **Remaining plates:**
  \[
  48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}
  \]

### Step 4: State the final quantities

After accounting for the broken items, Jeff has:

- **86 glasses**
- **42 plates**

### Final Answer

Jeff now has **86 glasses and 42 plates**.
