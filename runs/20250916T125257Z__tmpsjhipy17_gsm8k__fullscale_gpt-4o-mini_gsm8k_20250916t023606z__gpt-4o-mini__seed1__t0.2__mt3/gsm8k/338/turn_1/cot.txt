Let the number of students in each of the two equal groups be \( x \). According to the problem, the smallest group has \( x - 10 \) students.

Since there are three groups, we can set up the following equation based on the total number of students:

\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

Simplifying the left side, we combine like terms:

\[
2x + (x - 10) = 200
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
3x = 210
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of students in the smallest group:

\[
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\]
