To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
   We know that there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People per group}} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

   So, there are 10 groups formed.

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells:**
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to find \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10 groups:

   \[
   \text{Groups that brought back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]

   Thus, 6 groups brought back seashells.

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought back:**
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Since each group has 9 members, the total number of members in the 6 groups is:

   \[
   \text{Total members in 6 groups} = 6 \times 9 = 54
   \]

   Now, we calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these 54 members, where each member brings back 2 seashells:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = \text{Total members} \times \text{Seashells per member} = 54 \times 2 = 108
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]
