To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of groups formed**:
   We know that there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of people}}{\text{Number of people per group}} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells**:
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the 10 groups:

   \[
   \text{Groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the number of seashells brought back**:
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Since there are 6 groups and each group has 9 members, we first calculate the total number of members in these 6 groups:

   \[
   \text{Total members in 6 groups} = 6 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ members/group} = 54 \text{ members}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these members:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = \text{Total members} \times \text{Seashells per member} = 54 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ seashells/member} = 108 \text{ seashells}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by the members of the groups is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]
