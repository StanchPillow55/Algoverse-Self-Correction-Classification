To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song Lines**:
   - The solo song has **54 lines**.

2. **First Scene Lines**:
   - The first scene has **twice the number of lines** as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the number of lines in the first scene is:
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only **one-third** of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene Lines**:
   - The second scene has **six more lines** than the solo song. Therefore, the number of lines in the second scene is:
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - **Four-fifths** of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines to Memorize**:
   - Now, we will add the lines Sean has to memorize from all parts:
     - Lines from the solo song: **54 lines**
     - Lines from the first scene: **36 lines**
     - Lines from the second scene: **48 lines**
   - Therefore, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:
     \[
     54 + 36 + 48
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     \[
     54 + 36 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 48 = 138
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is **138 lines**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{138}
\]
