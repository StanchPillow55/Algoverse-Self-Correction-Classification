To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of red and white chickens, set up equations based on the information given, and then solve those equations step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up the Relationships:**
   - According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     w = r + 2
     \]

3. **Set Up the Egg Production Equation:**
   - Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total egg production from red chickens is \( 3r \).
   - White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total egg production from white chickens is \( 5w \).
   - The total number of eggs collected each day is 42. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5w = 42
     \]

4. **Substitute for \( w \):**
   - We can substitute \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

5. **Expand and Simplify:**
   - Distributing the 5:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]

6. **Solve for \( r \):**
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8r = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     r = 4
     \]

7. **Find \( w \):**
   - Now that we have \( r \), we can find \( w \) using the equation \( w = r + 2 \):
     \[
     w = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total egg production:
     - Red chickens: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs
     - White chickens: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs
     - Total: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \) eggs, which matches the information given in the problem.

Thus, the number of red chickens Jerry has is \( \boxed{4} \).
