To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about Jerry's chickens and the eggs they produce.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of white chickens.

2. **Set Up Relationships**:
   - According to the problem, Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     w = r + 2
     \]

3. **Egg Production**:
   - Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total egg production from red chickens is:
     \[
     3r
     \]
   - White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total egg production from white chickens is:
     \[
     5w
     \]

4. **Total Egg Collection**:
   - Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs each day. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     3r + 5w = 42
     \]

5. **Substitute for \( w \)**:
   - We can substitute \( w \) from the first equation into the second equation. Replacing \( w \) gives:
     \[
     3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
     \]

6. **Simplify the Equation**:
   - Distributing the 5:
     \[
     3r + 5r + 10 = 42
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8r + 10 = 42
     \]

7. **Isolate \( r \)**:
   - Subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     8r = 32
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8:
     \[
     r = 4
     \]

8. **Find \( w \)**:
   - Now that we have \( r \), we can find \( w \):
     \[
     w = r + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

9. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the total egg production:
     - Red chickens produce: \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) eggs.
     - White chickens produce: \( 5 \times 6 = 30 \) eggs.
     - Total eggs: \( 12 + 30 = 42 \), which matches the information given in the problem.

Thus, the calculations are consistent and correct.

**Final Answer**:
Jerry has \( \boxed{4} \) red chickens.
