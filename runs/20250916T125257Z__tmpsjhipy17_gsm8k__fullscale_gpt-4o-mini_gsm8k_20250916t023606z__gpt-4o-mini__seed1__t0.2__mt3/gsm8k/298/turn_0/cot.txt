To determine how much Carmen pays for the antique desk, we need to analyze the bidding process step by step.

1. **Opening Bid**: The auction starts with an opening bid of $200.

2. **Bidding Increments**: Each bid increases by $50.

3. **Number of Other Bidders**: There are 3 other people bidding before Carmen bids.

Let's denote the bids as follows:

- **Carmen's Bid**: \( C \)
- **Other Bidders' Bids**: \( O_1, O_2, O_3 \)

### Step-by-Step Bidding Process

1. **First Bid**:
   - Opening bid: $200
   - The first other bidder (let's call them Bidder 1) bids: 
     \[
     O_1 = 200 + 50 = 250
     \]

2. **Second Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 1:
     \[
     C_1 = 250 + 50 = 300
     \]

3. **Third Bid**:
   - The second other bidder (Bidder 2) bids:
     \[
     O_2 = 300 + 50 = 350
     \]

4. **Fourth Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 2:
     \[
     C_2 = 350 + 50 = 400
     \]

5. **Fifth Bid**:
   - The third other bidder (Bidder 3) bids:
     \[
     O_3 = 400 + 50 = 450
     \]

6. **Final Bid**:
   - Carmen bids after Bidder 3:
     \[
     C_3 = 450 + 50 = 500
     \]

### Conclusion

Carmen wins the auction with her final bid of $500. Therefore, the total amount of money she spends on the desk is:

\[
\text{Final Cost of the Desk} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
