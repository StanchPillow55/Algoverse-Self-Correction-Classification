To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total spaces} = \text{rows} \times \text{columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]
   This means there are 36 spaces available for books in the shelving system.

2. **Setting up the equation for the number of books**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   x = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   We will rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2x = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   -x = 20
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by -1:
   \[
   x = -20
   \]

4. **Interpreting the result**:
   The result \( x = -20 \) does not make sense in the context of the problem since the number of books cannot be negative. This indicates that there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the phrase "20 more than double the number of books." 

5. **Revisiting the interpretation**:
   The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" should actually be interpreted as:
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = 2 \times \text{number of books} + 20
   \]
   This leads to a contradiction, as it implies that the number of books is dependent on itself in a way that is not possible.

6. **Conclusion**:
   Given that the interpretation leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that Wendy's requirement cannot be fulfilled as stated. The problem may need to be rephrased or clarified to provide a feasible solution.

Thus, the final answer is that Wendy cannot carry a valid number of books based on the given condition.
