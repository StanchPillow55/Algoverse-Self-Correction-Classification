To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total capacity of the shelving system, we can calculate the total number of slots available for books:
   \[
   \text{Total slots} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Understanding Wendy's requirement**: 
   Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she currently has as \( x \). According to the problem, the number of books she wants to place can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**: 
   Since Wendy wants to place these books in the shelving system, we need to ensure that the number of books she wants to place does not exceed the total capacity of the shelving system. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]

4. **Solving the inequality**:
   To find the maximum number of books \( x \) that Wendy can currently have, we will solve the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]
   First, we subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x \leq 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x \leq 16
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x \leq \frac{16}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 8
   \]

5. **Calculating the number of books Wendy wants to place**:
   Since \( x \) can be at most 8, we can substitute \( x = 8 \) into the expression for the number of books she wants to place:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Wendy wants to place 36 books in the shelving system, which matches the total capacity of the shelving system. Therefore, she needs to carry 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
