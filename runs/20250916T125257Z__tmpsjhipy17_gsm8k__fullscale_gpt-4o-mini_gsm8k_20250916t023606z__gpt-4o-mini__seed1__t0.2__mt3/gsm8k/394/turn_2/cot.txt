To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of slots available for books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total slots} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Calculating the number of books Wendy wants**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." We need to express this mathematically. Let \( x \) be the number of books. The phrase "double the number of books" can be expressed as \( 2x \). Therefore, "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   Since Wendy wants to fill the shelving system, we set the expression for the number of books she wants equal to the total number of slots available:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we need to isolate it in the equation. We start by subtracting 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 20 - 20 = 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x = 16
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

5. **Finding the total number of books Wendy wants**:
   Now that we have \( x = 8 \), we can substitute this value back into the expression for the number of books Wendy wants:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
