To solve the problem, we will first determine the initial number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond, then we will add the fishes he buys, and finally, we will calculate the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes.

### Step 1: Count the initial number of fishes

1. **Initial male guppies**: 4
2. **Initial female guppies**: 7
3. **Initial male goldfishes**: 3
4. **Initial female goldfishes**: 5

Now, we will calculate the total number of male fishes and female fishes initially:

- **Total male fishes**:
  \[
  \text{Total male fishes} = \text{Male guppies} + \text{Male goldfishes} = 4 + 3 = 7
  \]

- **Total female fishes**:
  \[
  \text{Total female fishes} = \text{Female guppies} + \text{Female goldfishes} = 7 + 5 = 12
  \]

### Step 2: Count the number of fishes Tate buys

1. **Male guppies bought**: 2
2. **Female guppies bought**: 1
3. **Male goldfishes bought**: 2
4. **Female goldfishes bought**: 3

Now, we will calculate the total number of male fishes and female fishes bought:

- **Total male fishes bought**:
  \[
  \text{Total male fishes bought} = \text{Male guppies bought} + \text{Male goldfishes bought} = 2 + 2 = 4
  \]

- **Total female fishes bought**:
  \[
  \text{Total female fishes bought} = \text{Female guppies bought} + \text{Female goldfishes bought} = 1 + 3 = 4
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the new totals after the purchases

Now we will add the number of fishes bought to the initial counts:

- **New total male fishes**:
  \[
  \text{New total male fishes} = \text{Initial male fishes} + \text{Total male fishes bought} = 7 + 4 = 11
  \]

- **New total female fishes**:
  \[
  \text{New total female fishes} = \text{Initial female fishes} + \text{Total female fishes bought} = 12 + 4 = 16
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the difference between female and male fishes

Now we will find out how many more female fishes there are than male fishes:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{New total female fishes} - \text{New total male fishes} = 16 - 11 = 5
\]

### Final Answer

Tate has **5 more female fishes than male fishes**.
