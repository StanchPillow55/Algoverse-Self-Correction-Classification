To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Understanding the probabilities**:
   - The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a decimal:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of the second ticket winning, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculating the probability that both tickets are winners**:
   - The events of winning on each ticket are independent, meaning the outcome of one ticket does not affect the outcome of the other. Therefore, we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

3. **Performing the multiplication**:
   \[
   P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Converting the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]
