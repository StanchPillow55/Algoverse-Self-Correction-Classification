To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Identify the probability of winning for each ticket**:
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. In decimal form, this probability is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second ticket is said to be three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of winning for the second ticket, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners**:
   - Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent (the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other), we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

   - Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The probability that both tickets are winners, expressed as a percentage, is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]
