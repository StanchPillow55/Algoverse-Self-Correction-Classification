To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the brokerage fee and the transfer fee, and then compare it to her budget.

### Step 1: Calculate the Brokerage Fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Transfer Fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the House
Now we can find the total cost of the house by adding the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 59,500 = 409,500
\]

### Step 4: Compare Total Cost to Budget
Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
\]

### Final Answer
The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[
\text{Final Answer: } 9,500
\]
