To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. Then we will compare this total cost to her budget of $400,000.

**Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.**

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.**

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

Now we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 = 367,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 367,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
\]

**Step 4: Compare the total cost to Mrs. Cruz's budget.**

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9,500
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
