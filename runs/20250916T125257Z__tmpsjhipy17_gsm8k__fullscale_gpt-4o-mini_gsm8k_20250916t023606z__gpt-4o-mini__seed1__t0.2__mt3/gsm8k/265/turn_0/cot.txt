To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee.

1. **Identify the selling price of the house:**
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$350,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the brokerage fee:**
   The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. We can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 350,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
   \]

3. **Calculate the transfer fee:**
   The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. We can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 350,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the house:**
   The total cost includes the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 = 367,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 367,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
   \]

5. **Determine how much more the total price is than Mrs. Cruz's budget:**
   Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find the difference between the total cost and her budget:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9,500
   \]

Thus, the total price of the house is **$9,500** more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

**Final Answer: $9,500**
