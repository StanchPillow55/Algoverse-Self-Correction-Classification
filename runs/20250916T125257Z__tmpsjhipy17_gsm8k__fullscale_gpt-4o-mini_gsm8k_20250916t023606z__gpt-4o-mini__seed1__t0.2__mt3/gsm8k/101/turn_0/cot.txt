To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day over the next 4 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.**
   - Science: 4 pages
   - Social Studies: 20 pages
   - History: 7 pages
   - Geography: 8 pages

   We add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   4 + 20 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 + 7 = 31
   \]
   \[
   31 + 8 = 39
   \]

   So, the total number of pages Solo needs to read is **39 pages**.

2. **Determine how many pages Solo has already read.**
   - Solo read 15 pages on Monday.

3. **Calculate the remaining pages Solo needs to read.**
   We subtract the pages he has already read from the total pages:

   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = 39 - 15
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   39 - 15 = 24
   \]

   So, Solo has **24 pages** left to read.

4. **Calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day over the next 4 days.**
   We divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\text{Remaining pages}}{\text{Days left}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{24}{4}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   24 \div 4 = 6
   \]

   Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of **6 pages per day** over the next 4 days.

5. **Final Answer:**
   Solo needs to read **6 pages per day** on average for the next 4 days to complete his reading.
