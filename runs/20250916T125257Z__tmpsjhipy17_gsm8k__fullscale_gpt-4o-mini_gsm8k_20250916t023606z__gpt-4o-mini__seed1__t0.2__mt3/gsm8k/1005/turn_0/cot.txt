To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines**:
   The total population of porcupines in the park is given as 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.

   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

   So, there are 30 female porcupines.

2. **Determine the number of male porcupines**:
   The total population is 50, and we have found that there are 30 female porcupines. Therefore, the number of male porcupines is:

   \[
   \text{Number of male porcupines} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of babies born each month**:
   Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total babies per month} = \text{Number of female porcupines} \times \text{Babies per female}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year**:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

   \[
   \text{Total babies in a year} = \text{Total babies per month} \times 12
   \]

   Substituting the value we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
   \]

5. **Calculate the total population after a year**:
   To find the total population after a year, we need to add the number of babies born in a year to the initial population:

   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = \text{Initial population} + \text{Total babies in a year}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
   \]

Thus, the total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]
