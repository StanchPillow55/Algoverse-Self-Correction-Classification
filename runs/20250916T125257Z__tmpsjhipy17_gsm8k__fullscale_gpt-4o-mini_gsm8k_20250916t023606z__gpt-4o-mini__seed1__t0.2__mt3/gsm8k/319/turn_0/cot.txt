To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Letâ€™s denote:
- The number of electric poles as \( P \)
- The number of electric wires as \( W \)

From the ratio, we can express the relationship between poles and wires mathematically:
\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rearranged to express \( P \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} W
\]

We are given that the total number of electric wires \( W \) is 45. We can substitute this value into our equation:
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45
\]

Now, we perform the calculation:
\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply electricity in the neighborhood is \( P = 15 \).

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{The total number of electric poles required is } 15.
\]
