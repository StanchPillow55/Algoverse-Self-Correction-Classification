To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove after he has already removed 30 comic books, in order to reduce the weight of his book bag by a total of 15 pounds.

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the comic books removed

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound. If Uriah removes 30 comic books, we can calculate the total weight of the comic books removed as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of comic books removed} = \text{Number of comic books} \times \text{Weight per comic book}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weight of comic books removed} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining weight Uriah needs to remove

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. After removing the comic books, we need to find out how much more weight he still needs to remove:

\[
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = \text{Total weight to remove} - \text{Weight of comic books removed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many toys need to be removed

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve the remaining weight of 7.5 pounds, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Number of toys} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight to remove}}{\text{Weight per toy}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of toys} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

### Final Answer

Uriah needs to remove **15 toys** to achieve the total weight reduction of 15 pounds from his book bag.
