To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Watermelons**: The farm produced a total of 120 baby watermelons.

2. **Watermelons Ready for Harvest After Two Months**: 
   - Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - To find out how many watermelons this is, we calculate 30% of 120:
     \[
     0.30 \times 120 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons.

3. **Remaining Watermelons After First Harvest**:
   - After Ashlyn took 36 watermelons, the number of remaining watermelons is:
     \[
     120 - 36 = 84
     \]

4. **Watermelons Ready for Harvest After Two More Weeks**:
   - Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons (which is 84) were ready for harvest.
   - To find out how many watermelons this is, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
     \]
   - So, Ashlyn harvested 63 watermelons during this visit.

5. **Remaining Watermelons After Second Harvest**:
   - After harvesting 63 watermelons from the remaining 84, the number of watermelons left is:
     \[
     84 - 63 = 21
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is the remaining watermelons, which is:
     \[
     \boxed{21}
     \] 

Thus, the final answer is that there were 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.
