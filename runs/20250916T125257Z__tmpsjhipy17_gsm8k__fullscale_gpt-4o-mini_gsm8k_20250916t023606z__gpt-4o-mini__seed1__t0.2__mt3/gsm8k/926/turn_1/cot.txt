To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate his total spending for the month and see how much money he has left.

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby has $150 for the month.

2. **Movies Already Seen**:
   - **Friday/Saturday Movies**: 5 movies at $10 each.
   - **Other Day Movies**: 8 movies at $7 each.

   Let's calculate the total cost for the movies:

   - Cost for Friday/Saturday movies:
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Cost for other day movies:
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total cost for all movies:
     \[
     50 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} = 106 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Popcorn and Candy**:
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn at $8 each:
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy at $2 each:
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total cost for popcorn and candy:
     \[
     16 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Spending for the Month**:
   - Total spent on movies, popcorn, and candy:
     \[
     106 \text{ dollars} + 24 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Remaining Budget**:
   - Colby started with $150 and has spent $130:
     \[
     150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Cost of a Movie on Friday**: Since it is a Friday, the cost of a movie is $10.

7. **How Many More Movies Can He See?**:
   - With $20 remaining, we can calculate how many more movies he can see:
     \[
     \text{Number of movies} = \frac{20 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 2 \text{ movies}
     \]

**Final Answer**: Colby can see **2 more movies** on the last day of the month.
