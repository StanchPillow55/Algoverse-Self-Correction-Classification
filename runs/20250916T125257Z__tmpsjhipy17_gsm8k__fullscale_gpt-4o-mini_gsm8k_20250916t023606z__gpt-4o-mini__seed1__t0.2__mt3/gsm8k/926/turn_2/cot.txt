To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate his total spending for the month and how much money he has left.

1. **Monthly Budget**: Colby has $150 to spend.

2. **Expenses Already Incurred**:
   - **Movies on Fridays/Saturdays**: Colby saw 5 movies.
     - Cost for these movies: \(5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Movies on Other Days**: Colby saw 8 movies.
     - Cost for these movies: \(8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Popcorn**: Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn.
     - Cost for popcorn: \(2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}\)
   - **Candy**: Colby had 4 boxes of candy.
     - Cost for candy: \(4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}\)

3. **Total Expenses**:
   - Total spent on movies: \(50 + 56 = 106 \text{ dollars}\)
   - Total spent on snacks: \(16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars}\)
   - Total expenses for the month: \(106 + 24 = 130 \text{ dollars}\)

4. **Remaining Budget**:
   - Remaining money: \(150 - 130 = 20 \text{ dollars}\)

5. **Cost of Additional Items**:
   - Colby wants to buy 1 popcorn and 1 box of candy for the last day.
     - Cost for 1 popcorn: \(8 \text{ dollars}\)
     - Cost for 1 box of candy: \(2 \text{ dollars}\)
     - Total cost for snacks on the last day: \(8 + 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}\)

6. **Money Left After Snacks**:
   - Money left after buying snacks: \(20 - 10 = 10 \text{ dollars}\)

7. **Movies Colby Can See**:
   - On Fridays, each movie costs \(10 \text{ dollars}\).
   - With \(10 \text{ dollars}\) left, Colby can see:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
     \]

Thus, Colby can see **1 movie** on the last day of the month. 

**Final Answer**: 1 movie.
