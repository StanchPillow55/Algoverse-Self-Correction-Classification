To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Colby has already spent this month and how much he has left to spend on the last day of the month, which is a Friday. We will then calculate how many additional movies he can see, given the costs of tickets, popcorn, and candy.

### Step 1: Calculate Colby's total spending so far

1. **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays:**
   - Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays.
   - Cost per ticket on these days: $10.
   - Total cost for these movies:
     \[
     5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Movies on other days:**
   - Colby saw 8 movies on other days.
   - Cost per ticket on these days: $7.
   - Total cost for these movies:
     \[
     8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Popcorn:**
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn.
   - Cost per tub of popcorn: $8.
   - Total cost for popcorn:
     \[
     2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Candy:**
   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy.
   - Cost per box of candy: $2.
   - Total cost for candy:
     \[
     4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate total spending

Now, we will sum all the expenses:
\[
\text{Total spending} = \text{Cost of movies on Fridays/Saturdays} + \text{Cost of movies on other days} + \text{Cost of popcorn} + \text{Cost of candy}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending} = 50 \text{ dollars} + 56 \text{ dollars} + 16 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} = 130 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate remaining budget

Colbyâ€™s monthly allowance is $150. We will subtract his total spending from this amount to find out how much he has left:
\[
\text{Remaining budget} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine costs for the last day

On the last day, Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy:
- Cost of popcorn: $8
- Cost of candy: $2
- Total cost for popcorn and candy:
\[
\text{Total cost for popcorn and candy} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate remaining budget after popcorn and candy

Now we will subtract the cost of popcorn and candy from his remaining budget:
\[
\text{Remaining budget after popcorn and candy} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate how many movies he can see

With the remaining budget of $10, we will determine how many additional movies he can see. Since it is a Friday, the cost of a ticket is $10:
\[
\text{Number of movies} = \frac{\text{Remaining budget}}{\text{Cost per ticket}} = \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
\]

### Final Answer

Colby can see **1 movie** on the last day of the month.
