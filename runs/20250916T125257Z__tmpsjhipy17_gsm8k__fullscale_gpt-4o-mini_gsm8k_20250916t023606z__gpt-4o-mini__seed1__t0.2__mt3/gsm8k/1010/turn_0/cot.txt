To solve the problem, we will first determine how many laps each person can run based on the information provided.

1. **Bethany's Laps**:
   - Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.
   - Therefore, \( B = 10 \) laps.

2. **Trey's Laps**:
   - Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.
   - So, \( T = B + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \) laps.

3. **Shaelyn's Laps**:
   - Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.
   - Therefore, \( S = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) laps.

4. **Quinn's Laps**:
   - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.
   - Thus, \( Q = S - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \) laps.

Now we have the number of laps run by each person:
- Bethany: 10 laps
- Trey: 14 laps
- Shaelyn: 7 laps
- Quinn: 5 laps

5. **Finding the Difference**:
   - We need to find how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.
   - This is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = B - Q = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

Therefore, Bethany can run **5 more laps** compared to Quinn.

### Final Answer:
Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.
