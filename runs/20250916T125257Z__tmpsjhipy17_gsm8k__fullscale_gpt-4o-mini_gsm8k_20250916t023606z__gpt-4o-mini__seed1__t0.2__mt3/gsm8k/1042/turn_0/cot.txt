To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then finding the average loss.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Letâ€™s denote this loss as \( L_1 = -5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount he lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Therefore, the amount he won in the second race is:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Since he won $11 in the second race, we calculate 1.5 times that amount:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Now we will calculate the total amount lost. The total loss is the sum of the losses from the first and third races:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 = -5 + (-16.5) = -5 - 16.5 = -21.5
     \]

5. **Total Wins Calculation:**
   - The total amount won is simply the amount won in the second race:
     \[
     \text{Total Wins} = W_2 = 11
     \]

6. **Net Amount Calculation:**
   - To find the net amount, we can add the total wins to the total losses:
     \[
     \text{Net Amount} = \text{Total Wins} + \text{Total Loss} = 11 - 21.5 = -10.5
     \]
   - This means Johnny's dad lost a total of $10.5 after all three races.

7. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the average loss per race, we divide the total loss by the number of races (which is 3):
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-21.5}{3} \approx -7.1667
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The average loss that Johnny's dad experienced that day is approximately:
     \[
     \boxed{7.17}
     \] 

Thus, Johnny's dad lost an average of about $7.17 per race.
