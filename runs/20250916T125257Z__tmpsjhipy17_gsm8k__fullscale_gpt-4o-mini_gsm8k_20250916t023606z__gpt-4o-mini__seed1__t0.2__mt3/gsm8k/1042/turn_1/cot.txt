To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then find the average loss for the day.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Letâ€™s denote this loss as \( L_1 = 5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount he lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Adding $1 to this gives us the winnings from the second race:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - The winnings from the second race are $11, so 1.5 times this amount is:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Total Loss Calculation:**
   - Now we can calculate the total amount lost by Johnny's dad throughout the day. The total loss is the sum of the losses from the first and third races:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 = 5 + 16.5 = 21.5
     \]

5. **Total Races:**
   - There are a total of 3 races (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).

6. **Average Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{21.5}{3}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = 7.1667 \quad (\text{approximately})
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - Rounding to two decimal places, the average loss for the day is:
     \[
     \boxed{7.17}
     \]
