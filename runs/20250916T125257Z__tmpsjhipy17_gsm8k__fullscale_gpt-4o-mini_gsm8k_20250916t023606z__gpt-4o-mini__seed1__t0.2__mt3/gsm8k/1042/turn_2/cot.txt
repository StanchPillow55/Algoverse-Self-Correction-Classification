To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then find the average loss.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Letâ€™s denote this loss as \( L_1 = -5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - Johnny's dad won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Adding $1 to this gives us the winnings in the second race:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - The winnings from the second race are $11, so 1.5 times that amount is:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Losses and Wins:**
   - Total losses:
     - From the first race: \( L_1 = -5 \)
     - From the third race: \( L_3 = -16.5 \)
   - Total winnings:
     - From the second race: \( W_2 = 11 \)

5. **Net Gain/Loss Calculation:**
   - To find the total amount lost, we sum the losses and subtract the winnings:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 + W_2 = -5 - 16.5 + 11
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     - First, sum the losses:
       \[
       -5 - 16.5 = -21.5
       \]
     - Then add the winnings:
       \[
       -21.5 + 11 = -10.5
       \]
   - Therefore, the total loss for the day is $10.5.

6. **Calculating the Average Loss:**
   - There are three races in total.
   - To find the average loss, we divide the total loss by the number of races:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-10.5}{3}
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = -3.5
     \]

Thus, the average loss for Johnny's dad that day is **$3.50**. 

Final answer: **$3.50**.
