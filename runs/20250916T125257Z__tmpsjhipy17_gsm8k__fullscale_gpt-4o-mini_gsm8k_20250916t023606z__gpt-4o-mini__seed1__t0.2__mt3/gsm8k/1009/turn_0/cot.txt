To find the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Enrollment**: The school has a total of 3000 students.

2. **Students Over 16 Years Old**: Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Male Students Over 16 Years Old**: One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Female Students Over 16 Years Old**: To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16.
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Students Under 16 Years Old**: The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Male Students Under 16 Years Old**: Half of the students under 16 are male.
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Female Students Under 16 Years Old**: To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16.
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Total Female Students**: Now, we can find the total number of female students by adding the number of female students over 16 and under 16.
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = \text{Female students over 16} + \text{Female students under 16}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \( \boxed{1875} \).
