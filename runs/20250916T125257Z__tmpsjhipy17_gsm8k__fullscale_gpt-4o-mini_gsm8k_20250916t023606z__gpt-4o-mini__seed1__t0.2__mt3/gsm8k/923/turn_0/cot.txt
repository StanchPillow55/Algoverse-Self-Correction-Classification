To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the total cups of tea**: Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea.

2. **Dividing the cups into rows**: She divides these 27 cups into 3 rows. This means that the total number of cups in each row can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cups per row} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

3. **Tea types in each row**: In each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Let \( x \) be the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row. Since the amounts of chamomile and mint tea are equal, the number of cups of mint tea in each row will also be \( x \).

4. **Total cups of tea in each row**: Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, the total number of cups of tea in each row can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total cups in each row} = x + x = 2x
   \]

5. **Setting up the equation for cups in each row**: We know from step 2 that there are 9 cups in each row. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x = 9
   \]

6. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]

7. **Calculating the total cups of chamomile and mint tea**: Since \( x \) represents the number of cups of chamomile tea in each row, and since there are equal amounts of mint tea, each row has:
   - 4.5 cups of chamomile tea
   - 4.5 cups of mint tea

8. **Total cups of chamomile and mint tea**: The total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea in all 3 rows is:
   \[
   \text{Total chamomile tea} = 3 \times 4.5 = 13.5 \text{ cups}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total mint tea} = 3 \times 4.5 = 13.5 \text{ cups}
   \]

9. **Cinnamon tea**: The problem states that Lana uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. We need to check if the total cups of tea (chamomile, mint, and cinnamon) adds up to 27:
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = \text{Total chamomile tea} + \text{Total mint tea} + \text{Total cinnamon tea}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 13.5 + 13.5 + 15 = 42 \text{ cups}
   \]
   This indicates that there is a discrepancy since 42 cups exceed the available 27 cups.

10. **Revisiting the problem**: Since the problem states that she uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea, we need to reconsider the distribution of cups. The total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea must be less than 27 cups.

11. **Revising the calculations**: If we assume that the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea is \( y \), then:
   \[
   y + 15 = 27 \implies y = 12
   \]
   This means the total cups of chamomile and mint tea combined is 12 cups.

12. **Finding the cups of chamomile and mint tea in each row**: Since there are 3 rows, the total cups of chamomile and mint tea per row is:
   \[
   \text{Total cups in each row} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups}
   \]
   Since there are equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row:
   \[
   2x = 4 \implies x = 2
   \]

Thus, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:
\[
\text{Mint tea in each row} = 2 \text{ cups}
\]

**Final Answer**: There are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.
