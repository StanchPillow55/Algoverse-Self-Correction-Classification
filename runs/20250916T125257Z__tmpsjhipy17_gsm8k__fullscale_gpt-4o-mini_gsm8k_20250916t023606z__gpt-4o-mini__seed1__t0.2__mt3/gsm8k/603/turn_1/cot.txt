To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount of chocolate pounds made by Ruiz and Marissa together.

### Step 1: Calculate Ruiz's chocolate production rate

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total pounds by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's chocolate production rate

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we already calculated Ruiz's hourly rate, we can find Marissa's rate as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3 \times 60}{4} = \frac{180}{4} = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total chocolate production for both over 12 hours

Now that we have the rates for both Ruiz and Marissa, we can calculate how much chocolate they each produce in 12 hours.

**For Ruiz:**

\[
\text{Total chocolate by Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times \text{hours worked} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

**For Marissa:**

\[
\text{Total chocolate by Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times \text{hours worked} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total chocolate produced together

Now we can find the total amount of chocolate produced by both Ruiz and Marissa:

\[
\text{Total chocolate} = \text{Total chocolate by Ruiz} + \text{Total chocolate by Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 540 \text{ pounds} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of chocolate pounds made together by Ruiz and Marissa in 12 hours is:

\[
\boxed{1260} \text{ pounds}
\]
