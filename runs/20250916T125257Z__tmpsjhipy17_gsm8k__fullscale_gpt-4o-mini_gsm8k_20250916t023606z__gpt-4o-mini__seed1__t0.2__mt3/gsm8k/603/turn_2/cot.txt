To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Ruiz's chocolate production rate.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total amount by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's production rate.

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we know Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can find Marissa's hourly production as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production for both Ruiz and Marissa over 12 hours.

Now we will calculate how much chocolate each of them makes in 12 hours.

**For Ruiz:**
\[
\text{Total for Ruiz} = \text{Ruiz's rate} \times \text{time} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
\]

**For Marissa:**
\[
\text{Total for Marissa} = \text{Marissa's rate} \times \text{time} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount of chocolate made together.

Now we add the total amounts made by Ruiz and Marissa:

\[
\text{Total chocolate} = \text{Total for Ruiz} + \text{Total for Marissa} = 720 \text{ pounds} + 1080 \text{ pounds} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together is:

\[
\boxed{1800} \text{ pounds}
\]
