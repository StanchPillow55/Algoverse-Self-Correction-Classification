To solve the problem, we will first determine how much chocolate Ruiz and Marissa can make in an hour, and then calculate the total amount they can produce together in 12 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate Ruiz's hourly production
Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total pounds by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's hourly production} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's hourly production
Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we already calculated that Ruiz makes 60 pounds in 1 hour, we can find Marissa's production as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's hourly production} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds} = 45 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total production per hour
Now we can find the total amount of chocolate they make together in one hour by adding their hourly productions:

\[
\text{Total hourly production} = \text{Ruiz's hourly production} + \text{Marissa's hourly production}
\]
\[
\text{Total hourly production} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} + 45 \text{ pounds/hour} = 105 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total production in 12 hours
To find out how much chocolate they make together in 12 hours, we multiply their combined hourly production by the number of hours they work:

\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = \text{Total hourly production} \times 12 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = 105 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1260 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[
\boxed{1260} \text{ pounds}
\]
