To determine which job provides a higher net pay for Nick, we will calculate the net income for both Job A and Job B, taking into account their respective tax rates.

### Step 1: Calculate Net Income for Job A

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000

First, we calculate the annual gross income for Job A:

\[
\text{Gross Income} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours per Year} = 15 \times 2000 = 30000
\]

Next, we apply the tax rate of 20% to this gross income to find the net income:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \text{Gross Income} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000
\]

Now, we subtract the tax amount from the gross income to find the net income:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Gross Income} - \text{Tax Amount} = 30000 - 6000 = 24000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Net Income for Job B

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%

First, we calculate the net income after property tax:

\[
\text{Net Income After Property Tax} = \text{Annual Salary} - \text{Property Tax} = 42000 - 6000 = 36000
\]

Next, we apply the 10% tax rate on this net income after property tax:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \text{Net Income After Property Tax} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600
\]

Now, we subtract the tax amount from the net income after property tax to find the final net income for Job B:

\[
\text{Final Net Income} = \text{Net Income After Property Tax} - \text{Tax Amount} = 36000 - 3600 = 32400
\]

### Step 3: Compare Net Incomes

Now we compare the net incomes from both jobs:

- Net Income from Job A: $24,000
- Net Income from Job B: $32,400

To find out how much more money Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A, we subtract the net income of Job A from the net income of Job B:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Net Income from Job B} - \text{Net Income from Job A} = 32400 - 24000 = 8400
\]

### Final Answer

Nick will make **$8,400** more at Job B compared to Job A.
