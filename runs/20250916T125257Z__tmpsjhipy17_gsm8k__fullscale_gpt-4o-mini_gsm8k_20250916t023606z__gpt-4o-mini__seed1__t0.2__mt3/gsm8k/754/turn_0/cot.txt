To solve the problem, we need to carefully track Lorraine's stickers and buttons through each step of her trades. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Counts
- Lorraine starts with:
  - Small stickers: 30
  - Large stickers: 40

### Step 2: Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons
Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- 90% of 30 small stickers = \( 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \) small stickers.
- The value of 27 small stickers in terms of large buttons:
  - Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons, we can convert small stickers to large buttons:
  - 1 small sticker = 1 small button, and since 1 large button = 3 small stickers, we can say:
    - 27 small stickers = \( \frac{27}{3} = 9 \) large buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: \( 30 - 27 = 3 \)
- Large stickers: 40
- Large buttons: 9

### Step 3: Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons
Next, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- 50% of 40 large stickers = \( 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \) large stickers.
- Since 1 large sticker is worth 1 large button, she trades 20 large stickers for 20 large buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: 3
- Large stickers: \( 40 - 20 = 20 \)
- Large buttons: \( 9 + 20 = 29 \)

### Step 4: Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons
Lorraine trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons.
- She has 20 large stickers left, which she trades for small buttons:
- Since 1 large button is worth 3 small stickers, 20 large stickers will yield:
  - \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \) small buttons.

After this trade, Lorraine's counts are:
- Small stickers: 3
- Large stickers: 0
- Large buttons: 29
- Small buttons: 60

### Step 5: Total Button Count
Now, we need to find the total number of buttons Lorraine has:
- Total buttons = Large buttons + Small buttons
- Total buttons = \( 29 + 60 = 89 \)

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is \( \boxed{89} \).
