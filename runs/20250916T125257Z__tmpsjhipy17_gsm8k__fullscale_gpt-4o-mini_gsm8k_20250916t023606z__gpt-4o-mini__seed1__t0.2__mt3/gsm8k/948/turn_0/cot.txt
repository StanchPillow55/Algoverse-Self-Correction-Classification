To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper.**
2. **Determine the commission for each type of newspaper.**
3. **Add the commissions together to find the total commission.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total sales for each type of newspaper

**New York Times:**
- Price per copy = $5
- Number of copies sold = 6

Total sales from New York Times:
\[
\text{Total Sales NYT} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Wall Street Journal:**
- Price per copy = $15
- Number of copies sold = 10

Total sales from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Total Sales WSJ} = \text{Price per copy} \times \text{Number of copies sold} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the commission for each type of newspaper

**Commission for New York Times:**
- Commission rate = 10%

Commission from New York Times:
\[
\text{Commission NYT} = \text{Total Sales NYT} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Commission for Wall Street Journal:**
- Commission rate = 8%

Commission from Wall Street Journal:
\[
\text{Commission WSJ} = \text{Total Sales WSJ} \times \text{Commission Rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Add the commissions together to find the total commission

Total commission earned:
\[
\text{Total Commission} = \text{Commission NYT} + \text{Commission WSJ} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers.
