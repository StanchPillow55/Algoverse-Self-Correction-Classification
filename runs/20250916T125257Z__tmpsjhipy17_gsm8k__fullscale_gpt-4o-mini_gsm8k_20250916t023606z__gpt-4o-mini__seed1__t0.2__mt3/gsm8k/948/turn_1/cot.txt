To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the commission from the New York Times:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 6
   - **Cost per copy:** $5
   - **Commission rate:** 10%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the New York Times:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from New York Times} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from New York Times} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the commission from the Wall Street Journal:**
   - **Number of copies sold:** 10
   - **Cost per copy:** $15
   - **Commission rate:** 8%

   First, we calculate the total sales from the Wall Street Journal:
   \[
   \text{Total sales from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Number of copies} \times \text{Cost per copy} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the commission earned from these sales:
   \[
   \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = \text{Total sales} \times \text{Commission rate} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total commission earned:**
   Now, we sum the commissions from both newspapers:
   \[
   \text{Total commission} = \text{Commission from New York Times} + \text{Commission from Wall Street Journal} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers. 

Final answer: **$15**
