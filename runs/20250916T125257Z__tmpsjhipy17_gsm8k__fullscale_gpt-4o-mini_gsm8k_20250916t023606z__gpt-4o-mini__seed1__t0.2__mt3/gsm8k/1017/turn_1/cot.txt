To solve the problem, we need to determine how many selfies and portraits Olivia uploaded, given that she uploaded a total of 72 pictures and organized them into 8 albums.

### Step 1: Determine the number of pictures per album
Since Olivia uploaded 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

\[
\text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
\]

### Step 2: Identify the types of albums
According to the problem:
- 3 of the albums are selfies only.
- 2 of the albums are portraits only.
- The remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums) are unspecified in the problem, but we can assume they contain a mix of selfies and portraits.

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of selfies and portraits in the specified albums
Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of pictures in the selfies and portraits albums:

1. **Selfies**:
   - Number of selfies albums = 3
   - Pictures in selfies albums = 3 albums × 9 pictures/album = 27 selfies

2. **Portraits**:
   - Number of portraits albums = 2
   - Pictures in portraits albums = 2 albums × 9 pictures/album = 18 portraits

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of pictures in the unspecified albums
Now we can calculate how many pictures are left for the remaining 3 albums:

\[
\text{Total selfies and portraits} = 27 \text{ (selfies)} + 18 \text{ (portraits)} = 45
\]

\[
\text{Pictures in unspecified albums} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 72 - 45 = 27
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
We have determined the following:
- Olivia has **27 selfies**.
- Olivia has **18 portraits**.
- The remaining **27 pictures** are in the unspecified albums.

Thus, the final answer is:

- **Number of selfies: 27**
- **Number of portraits: 18**
