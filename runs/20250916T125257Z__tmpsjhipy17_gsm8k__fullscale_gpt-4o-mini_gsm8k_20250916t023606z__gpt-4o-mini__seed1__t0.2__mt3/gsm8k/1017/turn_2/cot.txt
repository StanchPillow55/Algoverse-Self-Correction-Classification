To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia uploaded into each type of album: selfies and portraits. 

1. **Determine the number of pictures per album**:
   Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them equally into 8 albums. To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

   So, each album contains 9 pictures.

2. **Identify the types of albums**:
   According to the problem, Olivia has:
   - 3 albums that contain only selfies
   - 2 albums that contain only portraits
   - The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) could potentially contain a mix of selfies and portraits, but we need to clarify that first.

3. **Calculate the total number of pictures in selfies and portraits**:
   Since we know that each album has 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of pictures in the albums that are specifically selfies and portraits.

   - **Selfies**: 
     \[
     \text{Total selfies} = \text{Number of selfie albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 3 \times 9 = 27
     \]

   - **Portraits**:
     \[
     \text{Total portraits} = \text{Number of portrait albums} \times \text{Pictures per album} = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pictures accounted for**:
   Now, we add the total number of selfies and portraits:
   \[
   \text{Total selfies and portraits} = \text{Total selfies} + \text{Total portraits} = 27 + 18 = 45
   \]

5. **Determine the remaining pictures**:
   Since Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures, we can find out how many pictures are left after accounting for the selfies and portraits:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = \text{Total pictures} - \text{Total selfies and portraits} = 72 - 45 = 27
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The remaining 27 pictures could be in the other 3 albums, but since the problem does not specify how these remaining pictures are categorized, we can conclude that Olivia has:
   - **27 selfies** in the selfie albums,
   - **18 portraits** in the portrait albums,
   - **27 pictures** in the remaining albums (which could be a mix of selfies and portraits).

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Selfies**: 27
- **Portraits**: 18

Final answer:
- Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
