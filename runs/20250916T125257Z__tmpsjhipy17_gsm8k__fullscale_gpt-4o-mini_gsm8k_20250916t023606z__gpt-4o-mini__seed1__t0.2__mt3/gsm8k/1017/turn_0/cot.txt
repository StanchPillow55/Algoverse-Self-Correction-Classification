To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia put in each album and then identify how many of those were selfies and how many were portraits.

1. **Total Pictures and Albums**: 
   Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums. 

2. **Pictures per Album**: 
   To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]
   This means each album contains 9 pictures.

3. **Types of Albums**: 
   According to the problem, 3 of the albums are selfies only, and 2 of the albums are portraits. The remaining albums (8 total - 3 selfies - 2 portraits = 3 albums) are unspecified in type.

4. **Calculating Selfies**: 
   Since each of the 3 selfie albums contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
   \]

5. **Calculating Portraits**: 
   Similarly, for the 2 portrait albums:
   \[
   \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
   \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Albums**: 
   The remaining 3 albums (which are unspecified) also contain 9 pictures each:
   \[
   \text{Total pictures in remaining albums} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ pictures}
   \]
   These 27 pictures could be of any type (not specified in the problem).

7. **Final Counts**: 
   Now we summarize:
   - Total selfies = 27
   - Total portraits = 18
   - Pictures in unspecified albums = 27

8. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Olivia has **27 selfies** and **18 portraits**.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
- **Selfies: 27**
- **Portraits: 18**
