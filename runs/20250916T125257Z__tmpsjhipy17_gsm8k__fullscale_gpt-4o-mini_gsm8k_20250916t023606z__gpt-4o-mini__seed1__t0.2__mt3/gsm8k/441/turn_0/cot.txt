To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of beads each sister bought and then find the difference between the two totals.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of beads for Elizabeth

Elizabeth bought:
- 1 pack of red beads
- 2 packs of clear beads

Each pack contains 20 pieces of beads. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth bought as follows:

\[
\text{Total beads for Elizabeth} = (\text{Number of red packs} + \text{Number of clear packs}) \times \text{pieces per pack}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total beads for Elizabeth} = (1 + 2) \times 20 = 3 \times 20 = 60
\]

So, Elizabeth has **60 beads**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of beads for Margareth

Margareth bought:
- 3 packs of blue beads
- 4 packs of red beads

Using the same method, we calculate the total number of beads Margareth bought:

\[
\text{Total beads for Margareth} = (\text{Number of blue packs} + \text{Number of red packs}) \times \text{pieces per pack}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total beads for Margareth} = (3 + 4) \times 20 = 7 \times 20 = 140
\]

So, Margareth has **140 beads**.

### Step 3: Find the difference in the number of beads

Now, we need to find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total beads for Margareth} - \text{Total beads for Elizabeth}
\]

Substituting the totals we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 140 - 60 = 80
\]

### Final Answer

Margareth has **80 more beads** than Elizabeth.
