To find the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of chimichangas made on each day:**
   - On **Tuesdays**, they make **125 chimichangas**.
   - On **Wednesdays**, they also make **125 chimichangas**.
   - On **Fridays**, they make **twice as many as they do on Tuesdays**. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays, on Fridays they will make:
     \[
     2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ chimichangas}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chimichangas made over the three days:**
   - We will add the number of chimichangas made on each day:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Chimichangas on Tuesday} + \text{Chimichangas on Wednesday} + \text{Chimichangas on Friday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 125 + 125 + 250
     \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday:
     \[
     125 + 125 = 250
     \]
   - Now, add the result to the number of chimichangas made on Friday:
     \[
     250 + 250 = 500
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 500
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{500}
\]
