To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money the company will receive from selling chocolate bars over a period of two weeks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

1. **Daily production**: The company produces 5000 bars in one day.
2. **Number of days in two weeks**: There are 14 days in two weeks (since 1 week has 7 days).
3. **Total production in two weeks**:
   \[
   \text{Total bars} = \text{Daily production} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bars} = 5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars.

1. **Selling price per bar**: The company sells each bar for $2.
2. **Total revenue**:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total bars} \times \text{Selling price per bar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

The company will receive a total of **$140,000** for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.
