To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some of them for fishing.

1. **Identify the initial quantities of shoeboxes:**
   - Blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Red shoeboxes: 9

2. **Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes.

3. **Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes.
   - To find out how many red shoeboxes that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
     \]
   - So, Tim uses 3 red shoeboxes.

4. **Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes:**
   - Initial blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Blue shoeboxes used: 3
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes:
     \[
     7 - 3 = 4
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes:**
   - Initial red shoeboxes: 9
   - Red shoeboxes used: 3
   - Remaining red shoeboxes:
     \[
     9 - 3 = 6
     \]

6. **Final counts of shoeboxes:**
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
   - Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

Thus, after Tim goes fishing, he has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.

**Final Answer:**
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.
