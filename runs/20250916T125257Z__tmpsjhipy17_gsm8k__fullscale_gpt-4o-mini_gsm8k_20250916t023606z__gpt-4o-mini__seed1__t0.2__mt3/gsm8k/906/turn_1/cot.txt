To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some of them for fishing.

### Step 1: Identify the initial quantities of shoeboxes
- Blue shoeboxes: 7
- Red shoeboxes: 9

### Step 2: Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses
Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes for fishing. 

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes
To find out how many blue shoeboxes are left, we subtract the number of blue shoeboxes used from the initial quantity:

\[
\text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = \text{Initial blue shoeboxes} - \text{Used blue shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = 7 - 3 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses
Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes. To find out how many red shoeboxes that is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Initial red shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes
Now, we subtract the number of red shoeboxes used from the initial quantity:

\[
\text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = \text{Initial red shoeboxes} - \text{Used red shoeboxes}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = 9 - 3 = 6
\]

### Step 6: Summarize the results
After Tim goes fishing, the remaining quantities of shoeboxes are:
- Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
- Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

### Final Answer
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.
