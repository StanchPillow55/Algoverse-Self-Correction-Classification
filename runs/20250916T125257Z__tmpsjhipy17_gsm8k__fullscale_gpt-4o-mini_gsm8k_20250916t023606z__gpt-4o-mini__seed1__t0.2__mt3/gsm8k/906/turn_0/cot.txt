To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some for fishing.

1. **Identify the initial quantities of shoeboxes:**
   - Blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Red shoeboxes: 9

2. **Determine how many blue shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes.

3. **Calculate the remaining blue shoeboxes:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = \text{Initial blue shoeboxes} - \text{Used blue shoeboxes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = 7 - 3 = 4
   \]

4. **Determine how many red shoeboxes Tim uses:**
   - Tim uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes.
   - To find \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the red shoeboxes, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Used red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining red shoeboxes:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = \text{Initial red shoeboxes} - \text{Used red shoeboxes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = 9 - 3 = 6
   \]

6. **Summarize the results:**
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
   - Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**Final Answer:**
Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.
