Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cats**: 
   We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats Taken by Boats**: 
   There are 4 boats, and each boat carries away 5 cats. To find the total number of cats taken away by the boats, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total cats taken} = \text{Number of boats} \times \text{Cats per boat} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Remaining Cats After Boats**: 
   We subtract the number of cats taken by the boats from the initial number of cats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cats} = \text{Initial cats} - \text{Total cats taken} = 50 - 20 = 30
   \]

4. **Cats Running After the Mouse**: 
   Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cats running after the mouse} = \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Remaining cats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18
   \]

5. **Final Number of Cats Left on the Rock**: 
   To find the final number of cats left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
   \[
   \text{Final number of cats} = \text{Remaining cats} - \text{Cats running after the mouse} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **12 cats left on the rock**.
