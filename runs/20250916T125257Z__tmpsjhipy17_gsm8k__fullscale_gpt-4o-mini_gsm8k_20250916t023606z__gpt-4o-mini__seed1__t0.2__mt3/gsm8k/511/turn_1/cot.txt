To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending some of his earnings.

1. **Calculate Gerald's earnings for the week:**
   - Gerald earns $30 per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Total earnings for the week = Daily earnings Ã— Number of days
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much he spent:**
   - Gerald spent a total of $100.

3. **Calculate how much money he has left:**
   - Money left = Total earnings - Total spent
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after working for a week and spending $100, Gerald has **$110 left**.

**Final Answer:** $110
