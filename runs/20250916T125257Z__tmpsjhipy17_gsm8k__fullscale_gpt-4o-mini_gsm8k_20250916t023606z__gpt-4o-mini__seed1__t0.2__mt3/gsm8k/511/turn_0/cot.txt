To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.**
2. **Determine how much he spent.**
3. **Calculate how much he has left after his spending.**

### Step 1: Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week

Gerald earns $30 every day. Since he worked for an entire week, we need to determine how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much he spent

According to the problem, Gerald spent a total of $100.

### Step 3: Calculate how much he has left after his spending

To find out how much money Gerald has left, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings.

\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Total spending}
\]
\[
\text{Amount left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Gerald has **$110** left after his spending.
