To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked over the given time period. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of days worked**:
   The team of painters worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate the total number of days as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   Each day, the team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day. To convert this into hours, we need to know how many hours are in a full day. Assuming a full day is 8 hours, we can calculate the hours worked each day:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:
   \[
   \text{Total hours worked by the team} = 3 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the hours worked by each painter**:
   There are 4 painters working together. To find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
   \[
   \text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{63 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 15.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, each painter worked for a total of 15.75 hours.

**Final Answer**: Each painter put in 15.75 hours of work.
