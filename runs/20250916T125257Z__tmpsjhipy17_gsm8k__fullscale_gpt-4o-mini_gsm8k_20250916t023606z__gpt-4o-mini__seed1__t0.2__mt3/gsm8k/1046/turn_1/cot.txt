To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked in total over the 3-week period.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days worked

The problem states that the painters worked for 3 weeks. We know that there are 7 days in a week, so we can calculate the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by the team

The painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. To find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days, we first need to convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day into hours. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate:

\[
\text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:

\[
\text{Total hours worked by the team} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the hours worked by each painter

Since there are 4 painters working together, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[
\text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Each painter worked for a total of **47.25 hours**.
