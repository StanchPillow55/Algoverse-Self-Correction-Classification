To determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how much money Jayden currently has.**
   - Jayden has $70 from selling pictures.

2. **Calculate how much money Ava gives to Jayden.**
   - Ava has an allowance of $90.
   - She gives Jayden half of her allowance:
     \[
     \text{Amount Ava gives} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]

3. **Calculate Jayden's total amount of money after receiving money from Ava.**
   - Now, we add the money Jayden already has to the money he received from Ava:
     \[
     \text{Total money Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of the camera.**
   - The camera costs $200.

5. **Calculate how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera.**
   - We subtract the total amount of money Jayden has from the cost of the camera:
     \[
     \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
     \]

Thus, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera.

**Final Answer: Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.**
