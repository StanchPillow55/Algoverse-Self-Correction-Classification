To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day, and then find the difference between the two times.

**Step 1: Calculate Ray's swimming time on a cold day.**

Ray swims 1 mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. Therefore, for 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a cold day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Ray's swimming time on a hot day.**

According to the problem, when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he swims in cold water. 

First, we calculate twice the cold water time:

\[
2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add 2 minutes to this time:

\[
32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, Ray swims 1 mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm. Therefore, for 3 miles:

\[
\text{Time on a hot day} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in time between hot and cold days.**

Now, we find the difference in time taken to swim 3 miles on a hot day compared to a cold day:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Time on a hot day} - \text{Time on a cold day} = 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.
