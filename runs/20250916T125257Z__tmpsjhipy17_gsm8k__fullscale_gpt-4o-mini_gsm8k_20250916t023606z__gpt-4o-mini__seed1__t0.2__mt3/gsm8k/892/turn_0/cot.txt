To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day based on the total amount she spends and the costs of the other items she consumes.

1. **Identify the costs of the items**:
   - The cost of the salad is given as $6.
   - The yogurt costs half the price of the salad. Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt**:
   - The total cost for the salad and yogurt combined is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total amount Ellen spends on carrots**:
   - We know that Ellen spends a total of $11 on her goods. Therefore, the amount she spends on carrots can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of carrots} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost per carrot**:
   - Ellen eats two carrots every day. To find the cost per carrot, we divide the total cost of the carrots by the number of carrots:
     \[
     \text{Cost per carrot} = \frac{\text{Total cost of carrots}}{\text{Number of carrots}} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot every day is:
     \[
     \boxed{1} \text{ dollar}
     \]
