To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the alarm rang in total throughout the day based on the information provided.

1. **First Alarm Ringing**:
   - The first time the alarm went off, it rang **4 times**.

2. **Second Alarm Ringing**:
   - The second time the alarm went off, it rang for **three times as long** as the first time. 
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, we calculate the number of rings for the second time:
     \[
     \text{Second time rings} = 3 \times \text{First time rings} = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, the second time it rang **12 times**.

3. **Third Alarm Ringing**:
   - The third time the alarm went off, it rang for **half as long** as the second time.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, we calculate the number of rings for the third time:
     \[
     \text{Third time rings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Second time rings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the third time it rang **6 times**.

4. **Total Rings**:
   - Now, we add up all the rings from the three times the alarm went off:
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = \text{First time rings} + \text{Second time rings} + \text{Third time rings}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = 4 + 12 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total rings} = 22
     \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang in all is **22**.

Final answer: **22**.
