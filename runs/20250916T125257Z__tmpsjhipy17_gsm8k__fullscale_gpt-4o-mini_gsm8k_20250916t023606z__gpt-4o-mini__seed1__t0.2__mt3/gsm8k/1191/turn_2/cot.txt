To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of Hair Color**:  
   The cost for the hair color is given as $40.

2. **Cost of Haircut**:  
   The haircut cost is $30 per inch.  
   May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.  
   Therefore, the amount of hair cut off is:
   \[
   \text{Hair cut off} = \text{Starting length} - \text{Ending length} = 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   \text{Cost of haircut} = \text{Cost per inch} \times \text{Inches cut} = 30 \text{ dollars/inch} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost**:  
   Now, we add the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair color} + \text{Cost of haircut} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of May's haircut and color is \(\boxed{100}\) dollars.
