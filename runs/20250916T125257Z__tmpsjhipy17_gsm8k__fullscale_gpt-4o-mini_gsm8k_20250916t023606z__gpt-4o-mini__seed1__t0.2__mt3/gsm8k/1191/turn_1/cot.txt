To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of the Color**: 
   - The cost for coloring her hair is given as $40.

2. **Cost of the Haircut**:
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. 
   - The amount of hair cut off is:
     \[
     10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch. Therefore, the cost for cutting off 2 inches is:
     \[
     2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollars (color)} + 60 \text{ dollars (haircut)} = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for May's haircut and color is:

\[
\boxed{100 \text{ dollars}}
\]
