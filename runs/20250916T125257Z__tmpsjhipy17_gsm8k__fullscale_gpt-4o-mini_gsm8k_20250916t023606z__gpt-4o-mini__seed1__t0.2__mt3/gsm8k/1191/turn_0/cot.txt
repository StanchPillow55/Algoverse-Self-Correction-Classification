To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of Hair Color**: 
   - The cost for coloring her hair is given as $40. 
   - Therefore, the cost for hair color is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of hair color} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Haircut**:
   - The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. 
   - To find out how many inches were cut, we subtract the final length from the initial length:
     \[
     \text{Inches cut} = \text{Initial length} - \text{Final length} = 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut based on the inches cut:
     \[
     \text{Cost of haircut} = \text{Inches cut} \times \text{Cost per inch} = 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair color} + \text{Cost of haircut} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost of May's haircut and color is:
\[
\boxed{100 \text{ dollars}}
\]
