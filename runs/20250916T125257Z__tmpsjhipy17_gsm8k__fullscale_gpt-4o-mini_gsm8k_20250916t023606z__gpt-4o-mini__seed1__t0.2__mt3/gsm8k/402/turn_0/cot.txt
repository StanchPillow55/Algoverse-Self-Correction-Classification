To solve the problem, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies, and then calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy.

### Step 1: Calculate the ingredients needed for a quadruple batch.

The normal recipe calls for:
- **Flour**: 3 cups
- **Milk**: 1 cup

Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amounts by 4:

**Flour needed**:
\[
3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups of flour}
\]

**Milk needed**:
\[
1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups of milk}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are needed.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so we need to find out how many bags of flour Mark needs:

**Bags of flour needed**:
\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total cups of flour}}{\text{Cups per bag}} = \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}
\]

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so we need to find out how many bottles of milk Mark needs:

**Bottles of milk needed**:
\[
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total cups of milk}}{\text{Cups per bottle}} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy.

Now we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Bags of flour} - \text{Bottles of milk} = 6 - 2 = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Mark has to buy **4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk**.
