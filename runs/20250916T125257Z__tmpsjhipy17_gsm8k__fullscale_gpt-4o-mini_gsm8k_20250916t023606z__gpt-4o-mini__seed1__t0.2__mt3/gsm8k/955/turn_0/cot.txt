To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of occupied beds**.
2. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks**.
3. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks**.
4. **Determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks**.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of occupied beds

The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and it is stated that \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the beds are occupied. 

To find the number of occupied beds:

\[
\text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks

We know that 50 patients are admitted each day. We need to calculate the total number of patients admitted over 2 weeks (which is 14 days).

\[
\text{Total patients admitted} = 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks

Initially, there are 200 occupied beds. After admitting 700 patients, we need to add this number to the initial occupied beds:

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks

To find the number of unoccupied beds, we subtract the total number of occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital:

\[
\text{Unoccupied beds} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total occupied beds}
\]
\[
\text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{100} \).
