Let's denote the number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have as \( S \), \( A \), and \( F \) respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Together, they have 85 books:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Now substitute these into the first equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Now, isolate \( F \):
\[
3F = 85 - 1
\]
\[
3F = 84
\]
\[
F = \frac{84}{3}
\]
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.

To verify, we can find the number of books Sofie and Anne have:
- From \( A = F - 12 \):
  \[
  A = 28 - 12 = 16
  \]
- From \( S = A + 25 \):
  \[
  S = 16 + 25 = 41
  \]

Now check the total:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

The calculations are consistent, confirming that Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.
