Let's denote the number of books that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have as \( S \), \( A \), and \( F \) respectively.

We are given the following information:

1. Together, they have 85 books:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12 \implies S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
\]

Now we have:
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Substituting these into the first equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Now simplify the equation:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Next, subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Now, divide by 3:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.

To verify, we can find the number of books Sofie and Anne have:
- \( A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16 \)
- \( S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41 \)

Now check the total:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

The calculations are correct, confirming that Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.
