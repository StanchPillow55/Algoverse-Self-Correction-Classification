To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the number of books each person has.

Let:
- \( S \) = number of books Sofie has
- \( A \) = number of books Anne has
- \( F \) = number of books Fawn has

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have 85 books:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Next, substitute these expressions into the first equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Now, isolate \( F \):
\[
3F = 85 - 1
\]
\[
3F = 84
\]
\[
F = \frac{84}{3}
\]
\[
F = 28
\]

Now that we have found \( F \), we can also find \( A \) and \( S \) to verify our solution:
- Using \( F = 28 \) to find \( A \):
\[
A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16
\]

- Now find \( S \):
\[
S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41
\]

Finally, we check if the total number of books adds up to 85:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

Since the calculations are correct, we conclude that Fawn has:

\[
\boxed{28}
\] books.
