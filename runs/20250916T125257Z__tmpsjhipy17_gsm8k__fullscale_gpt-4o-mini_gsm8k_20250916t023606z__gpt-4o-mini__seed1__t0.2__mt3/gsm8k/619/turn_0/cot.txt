To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.**
   Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Street lights per intersection} = \text{Number of poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Street lights per intersection} = 6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections.**
   The road has 4 intersections. We can find the total number of street lights for all intersections by multiplying the number of street lights per intersection by the number of intersections:

   \[
   \text{Total street lights} = \text{Street lights per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total street lights} = 24 \times 4 = 96
   \]

3. **Account for the non-functioning street lights.**
   We know that 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:

   \[
   \text{Functioning street lights} = \text{Total street lights} - \text{Non-functioning street lights}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The total number of functioning street lights is:

   \[
   \boxed{76}
   \]
