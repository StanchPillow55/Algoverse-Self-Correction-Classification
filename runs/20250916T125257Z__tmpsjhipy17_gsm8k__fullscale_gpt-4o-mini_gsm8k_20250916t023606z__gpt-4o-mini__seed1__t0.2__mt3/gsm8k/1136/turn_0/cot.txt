To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Bob currently has.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Bob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more marbles.
   - A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let \(x\) be the number of marbles Bob currently has.
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This can be expressed with the equation:
   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

3. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   - To find \(x\), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 60 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 36
   \]
   So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

4. **Finding the number of marbles after losing 10**:
   - Now, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 from the number of marbles he currently has:
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = x - 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = 36 - 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles after losing 10} = 26
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have **26 marbles**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
