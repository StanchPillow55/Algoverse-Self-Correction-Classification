Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a certain number of marbles, which we will denote as \( x \).
   - If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
   - We need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles.

2. **Convert Dozens to Individual Marbles**:
   - A dozen is 12. Therefore, 2 dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ marbles}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

5. **Calculate the Number of Marbles After Losing 10**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have:
     \[
     \boxed{26} \text{ marbles}
     \]
