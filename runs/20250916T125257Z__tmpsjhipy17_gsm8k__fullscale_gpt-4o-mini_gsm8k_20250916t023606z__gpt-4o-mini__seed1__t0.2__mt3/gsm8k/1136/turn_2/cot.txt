Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a certain number of marbles, which we will denote as \( x \).
   - If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

2. **Calculating 2 Dozen**:
   - A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24
     \]

3. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can express this as:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

5. **Finding the Number of Marbles After Losing 10**:
   - If Bob loses 10 marbles, we calculate the new total:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have:
     \[
     \boxed{26}
     \] marbles.
