To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each book that Anna bought today. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Initial Budget**: Anna had a budget of $16.

2. **Amount Spent**: She has already spent $4.

3. **Remaining Budget**: We can calculate how much money Anna has left after her initial spending:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Budget} = \text{Initial Budget} - \text{Amount Spent} = 16 - 4 = 12
   \]
   So, Anna has $12 left in her budget.

4. **Amount Left After Buying Books**: After buying the books, Anna has $2 left. We can find out how much she spent on the books:
   \[
   \text{Amount Spent on Books} = \text{Remaining Budget} - \text{Amount Left} = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]
   Therefore, Anna spent $10 on the two books.

5. **Cost of Each Book**: Since Anna bought 2 books and both cost the same amount, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total amount spent on the books by the number of books:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Each Book} = \frac{\text{Amount Spent on Books}}{\text{Number of Books}} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

Thus, the cost of each book is $5.

**Final Answer**: Each book cost $5.
