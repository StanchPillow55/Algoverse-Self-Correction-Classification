To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: We know that there are 50 students in total.

2. **Identify the number of students with specific hobbies**:
   - Students who like to bake: 10
   - Students who like to play basketball: 5

3. **Determine the number of students who like to play music**:
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.
   - Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games**:
   - We know the total number of students is 50. We can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to bake, play basketball, and play music from the total number of students.
   - The number of students who like to bake is 10, the number who like to play basketball is 5, and the number who like to play music is 10. Therefore, the total number of students who have specified hobbies is:
     \[
     \text{Total with specified hobbies} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of students who like to play video games**:
   - Now, we subtract the total number of students with specified hobbies from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 25 = 25
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{25} \).
