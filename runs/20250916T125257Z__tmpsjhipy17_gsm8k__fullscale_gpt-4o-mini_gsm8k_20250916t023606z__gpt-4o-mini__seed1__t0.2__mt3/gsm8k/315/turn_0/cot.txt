To determine how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of invited guests:**
   - Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ people}
     \]
   - She also invited 3 families with 4 people each:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ people}
     \]
   - Now, we add the two groups together to find the total number of invited guests:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine how many people couldn't come:**
   - According to the problem, 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

3. **Calculate how many people had previous commitments:**
   - The problem states that 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments. Since 8 people couldn't come, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend:**
   - Now, we add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those who had previous commitments:
     \[
     8 + 2 = 10 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of people who will show up:**
   - To find out how many people will actually show up at the party, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invited guests:
     \[
     24 - 10 = 14 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **14 people show up for Martha's party.**
