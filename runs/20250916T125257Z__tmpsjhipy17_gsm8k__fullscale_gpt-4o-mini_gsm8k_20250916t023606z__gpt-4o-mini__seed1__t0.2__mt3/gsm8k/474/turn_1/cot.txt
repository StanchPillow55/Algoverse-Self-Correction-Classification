Let \( x \) be the total number of students at that grade level.

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer. This means that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer. 

We can express this mathematically as:
\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

This equation states that one-fourth of the total number of students \( x \) equals 20 students who do not have desktop computers.

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]
\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at that grade level is \( \boxed{80} \).
