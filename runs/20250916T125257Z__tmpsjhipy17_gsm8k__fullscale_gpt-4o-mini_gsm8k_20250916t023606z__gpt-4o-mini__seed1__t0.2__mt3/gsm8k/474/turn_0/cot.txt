To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students at a certain grade level, given that three-fourths of them have desktop computers and that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Let's denote the total number of students as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that the fraction of students who do not have desktop computers is:

\[
1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

This fraction represents the students who do not have desktop computers. We know from the problem statement that the number of students who do not have desktop computers is 20. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times x = 20
\]

To find \( x \), we can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at that grade level is \( 80 \).

To verify our solution, we can check the number of students who have desktop computers:

1. Calculate the number of students who have desktop computers:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
   \]

2. Calculate the number of students who do not have desktop computers:
   \[
   80 - 60 = 20
   \]

Since this matches the information given in the problem (that 20 students do not have desktop computers), our solution is confirmed.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
