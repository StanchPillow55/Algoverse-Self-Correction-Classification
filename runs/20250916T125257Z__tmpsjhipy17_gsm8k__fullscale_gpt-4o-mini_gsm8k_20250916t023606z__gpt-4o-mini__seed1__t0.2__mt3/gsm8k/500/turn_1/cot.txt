Let's define the number of insects each person found using variables:

- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can express the number of insects Lily found as \( L = D + 7 \).
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found. According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this relationship as \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \).

Now, we know the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
L + D + B = 43
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

1. Substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
   \[
   L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
   \]

2. Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   \[
   2B + 7 = 43
   \]

4. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2B = 36
   \]

5. Divide by 2:
   \[
   B = 18
   \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \) and \( L \):

6. Calculate \( D \):
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
   \]

7. Calculate \( L \):
   \[
   L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

Finally, we have determined that Lily found \( L = 16 \) insects.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
