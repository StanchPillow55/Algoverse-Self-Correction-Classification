To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of students**: 
   The total number of students in the hall is given as 1000.

2. **Calculate the number of students who exited through entrance A**:
   According to the problem, 30% of the students exited through entrance A. 
   \[
   \text{Number of students exiting through A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = \frac{30}{100} \times 1000 = 300
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of remaining students after some exited through A**:
   After 300 students exited through A, the number of remaining students is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of students who exited through entrance B**:
   The problem states that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students exited through entrance B. 
   \[
   \text{Number of students exiting through B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of remaining students after some exited through B**:
   After 420 students exited through B, the number of remaining students is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

6. **Determine the number of students who exited through entrance C**:
   The remaining students, which is 280, exited through entrance C.
   \[
   \text{Number of students exiting through C} = 280
   \]

Finally, we can state the answer:

The number of students who went out through exit C is \( \boxed{280} \).
