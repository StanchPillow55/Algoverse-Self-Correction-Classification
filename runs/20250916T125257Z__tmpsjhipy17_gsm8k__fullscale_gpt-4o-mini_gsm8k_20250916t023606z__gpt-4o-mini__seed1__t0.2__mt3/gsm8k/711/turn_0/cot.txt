To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the special deal offered by the ice cream parlor: buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

1. **Understanding the Cost of Scoops**:
   - Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.
   - With the deal, if Erin buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 additional scoop for free.

2. **Calculating the Cost for the Deal**:
   - If Erin buys 2 scoops, the cost will be:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/scoop} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With this deal, she will receive a total of:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} + 1 \text{ free scoop} = 3 \text{ scoops}
     \]

3. **Finding How Many Deals Erin Can Afford**:
   - Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of the deal she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of one deal:
     \[
     \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{3.00 \text{ dollars/deal}} = 2 \text{ deals}
     \]
   - This means Erin can buy 2 deals.

4. **Calculating Total Scoops from the Deals**:
   - Since each deal gives her 3 scoops, if she buys 2 deals, the total number of scoops she will get is:
     \[
     2 \text{ deals} \times 3 \text{ scoops/deal} = 6 \text{ scoops}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Erin spends:
     \[
     2 \text{ deals} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/deal} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - She spends all her money and gets 6 scoops of ice cream.

Thus, the final answer is that Erin should buy **6 scoops of ice cream**.
