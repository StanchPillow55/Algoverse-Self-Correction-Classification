To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the ice cream parlor's deal of "buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free."

### Step 1: Understand the cost of scoops
Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. 

### Step 2: Determine how many scoops Erin can buy without the deal
First, we calculate how many scoops Erin can buy with her $6.00 if there were no deals:
\[
\text{Number of scoops} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per scoop}} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the deal
Now, we need to consider the deal: for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin gets 1 additional scoop for free. 

#### Buying 2 scoops:
If Erin buys 2 scoops, she will pay:
\[
2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
\]
With this purchase, she gets 1 additional scoop for free, so she now has:
\[
2 \text{ scoops} + 1 \text{ free scoop} = 3 \text{ scoops}
\]

#### Remaining money:
After buying 2 scoops, Erin has:
\[
6.00 - 3.00 = 3.00 \text{ dollars left}
\]

### Step 4: Buy more scoops with remaining money
Now, with the remaining $3.00, Erin can buy more scoops. We calculate how many additional scoops she can buy:
\[
\text{Number of additional scoops} = \frac{3.00}{1.50} = 2 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Step 5: Total scoops
Now we add the scoops Erin has:
- From the first purchase (2 scoops + 1 free scoop): 3 scoops
- From the second purchase: 2 scoops

Thus, the total number of scoops Erin can have is:
\[
3 + 2 = 5 \text{ scoops}
\]

### Final Answer
Erin should buy a total of **5 scoops of ice cream**.
