To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Pricing and Deal**:
   - Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.
   - The deal is: Buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free.

2. **Calculating the Cost of Scoops**:
   - If Erin buys 2 scoops, she pays:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/scoop} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With this deal, she gets 1 additional scoop for free, so in total, she receives:
     \[
     2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops}
     \]

3. **Determining How Many Sets of Scoops Erin Can Buy**:
   - Erin has $6.00. We need to determine how many sets of 2 scoops she can buy with this amount.
   - Each set of 2 scoops costs $3.00. To find out how many sets she can buy, we divide her total money by the cost of one set:
     \[
     \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{3.00 \text{ dollars/set}} = 2 \text{ sets}
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Scoops**:
   - Since each set gives her 3 scoops, if she buys 2 sets, the total number of scoops she will get is:
     \[
     2 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ scoops/set} = 6 \text{ scoops}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Erin can buy 2 sets of 2 scoops, which gives her 6 scoops in total, and she spends:
     \[
     2 \text{ sets} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/set} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - This is exactly her budget.

Thus, Erin should buy a total of **6 scoops of ice cream**.

**Final Answer**: 6 scoops of ice cream.
