To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the duration of burning**: 
   We need to find out how many hours the candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

   - Start time: 1:00 PM
   - End time: 5:00 PM

   To calculate the duration:
   \[
   5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total melting**:
   The candle melts at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. We need to multiply the number of hours the candle burns by the melting rate.

   - Melting rate: 2 centimeters/hour
   - Duration: 4 hours

   Now, we calculate the total melting:
   \[
   \text{Total melting} = \text{Melting rate} \times \text{Duration} = 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   After burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8 \text{ cm}}
\]
