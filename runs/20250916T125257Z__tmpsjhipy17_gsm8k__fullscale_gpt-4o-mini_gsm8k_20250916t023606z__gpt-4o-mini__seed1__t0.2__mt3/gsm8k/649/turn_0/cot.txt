To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week. We can denote this initial number of likes as:
   \[
   L_0 = 2000
   \]

2. **Likes After Three Weeks**: The problem states that three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   L_3 = 70 \times L_0 = 70 \times 2000
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   L_3 = 140000
   \]

3. **New Likes Received**: The problem also states that she received 20000 more new likes recently. We can denote the new likes as:
   \[
   L_{\text{new}} = 20000
   \]

4. **Total Likes Calculation**: To find the total number of likes after receiving the new likes, we add the likes after three weeks to the new likes:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = L_3 + L_{\text{new}} = 140000 + 20000
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   L_{\text{total}} = 160000
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes on Fishio's selfie is:
   \[
   \boxed{160000}
   \]
