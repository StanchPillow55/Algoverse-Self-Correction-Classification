To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of boxes sold and the total earnings for both days.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boxes sold on Saturday

Let:
- \( G_S \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday
- \( A_S \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday
- \( G_S = 10 \) (given)
- \( A_S = G_S - 4 \) (4 fewer boxes than gingerbread)

Calculating the number of apple pies sold on Saturday:
\[
A_S = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of boxes sold on Sunday

Let:
- \( G_{Su} \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday
- \( A_{Su} \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday
- \( G_{Su} = G_S + 5 \) (5 more boxes than Saturday)
- \( A_{Su} = 15 \) (given)

Calculating the number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday:
\[
G_{Su} = 10 + 5 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for both days

Now we will calculate the total earnings for each type of item sold on both days.

**Saturday Earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread:
\[
\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Saturday} = G_S \times \text{Price per box} = 10 \times 6 = 60
\]
- Earnings from apple pie:
\[
\text{Earnings from apple pie on Saturday} = A_S \times \text{Price per box} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]
- Total earnings on Saturday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Saturday} = 60 + 90 = 150
\]

**Sunday Earnings:**
- Earnings from gingerbread:
\[
\text{Earnings from gingerbread on Sunday} = G_{Su} \times \text{Price per box} = 15 \times 6 = 90
\]
- Earnings from apple pie:
\[
\text{Earnings from apple pie on Sunday} = A_{Su} \times \text{Price per box} = 15 \times 15 = 225
\]
- Total earnings on Sunday:
\[
\text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 90 + 225 = 315
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for both days

Now we will sum the total earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total earnings for two days} = \text{Total earnings on Saturday} + \text{Total earnings on Sunday} = 150 + 315 = 465
\]

### Final Answer
Sunny earned a total of **$465** for the two days.
