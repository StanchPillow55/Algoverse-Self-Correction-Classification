To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the Depreciation Formula
The formula for the value of an asset after depreciation is given by:

\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the asset after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial purchase price of the asset.
- \( r \) is the rate of depreciation (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the Variables
From the problem:
- \( P = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010)

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula
Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)
First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \)
Next, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step by step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.492039 \)

Thus, \( (0.79)^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the Value of the Car
Now we can find the value of the car:

\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer
The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
