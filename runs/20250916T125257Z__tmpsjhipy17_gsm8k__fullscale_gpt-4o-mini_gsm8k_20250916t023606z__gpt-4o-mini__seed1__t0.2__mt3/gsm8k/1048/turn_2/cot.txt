To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula

The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the values

From the problem:
- Initial price \( P = 20000 \)
- Depreciation rate \( r = 21\% = 0.21 \)
- Time period \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years

### Step 3: Plug the values into the formula

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)

First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Raise \( 0.79 \) to the power of 3

Now we calculate \( 0.79^3 \):

\[
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 \approx 0.492039 \)

So, \( 0.79^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Multiply by the initial price

Now we multiply this result by the initial price of the car:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
V \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
