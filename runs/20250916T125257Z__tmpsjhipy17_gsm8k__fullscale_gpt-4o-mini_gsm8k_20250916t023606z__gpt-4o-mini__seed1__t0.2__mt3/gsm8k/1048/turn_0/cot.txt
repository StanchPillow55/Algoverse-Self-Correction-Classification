To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula

The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:

\[
V = P \times (1 - r)^t
\]

Where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years.
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car.
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal).
- \( t \) is the number of years since the purchase.

### Step 2: Identify the variables

From the problem:
- \( P = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car)
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%)
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010)

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

\[
V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)

First, calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):

\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( (0.79)^3 \)

Next, we need to calculate \( (0.79)^3 \):

\[
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]

Calculating step by step:

1. \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
2. \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 = 0.492039 \)

So, \( (0.79)^3 \approx 0.492039 \).

### Step 6: Calculate the value of the car

Now substitute this back into the equation for \( V \):

\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
V \approx 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
