To determine how much the store will receive after all the balls are sold, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling each type of ball. We will do this by multiplying the number of each type of ball by its respective price and then summing these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the revenue from red balls
- **Number of red balls:** 3
- **Cost per red ball:** $9

The total revenue from red balls can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Revenue from red balls} = \text{Number of red balls} \times \text{Cost per red ball} = 3 \times 9 = 27
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the revenue from blue balls
- **Number of blue balls:** 11
- **Cost per blue ball:** $5

The total revenue from blue balls can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Revenue from blue balls} = \text{Number of blue balls} \times \text{Cost per blue ball} = 11 \times 5 = 55
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the revenue from green balls
- **Number of green balls:** 25
- **Cost per green ball:** $3

The total revenue from green balls can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Revenue from green balls} = \text{Number of green balls} \times \text{Cost per green ball} = 25 \times 3 = 75
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from all balls
Now, we will sum the revenues from all three types of balls:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from red balls} + \text{Revenue from blue balls} + \text{Revenue from green balls}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 27 + 55 + 75
\]

Now, we perform the addition:
\[
27 + 55 = 82
\]
\[
82 + 75 = 157
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount the store will have received after all the balls are sold is:
\[
\boxed{157}
\]
