To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the roses

Jenny buys 15 roses. We know that:
- The cost of one rose is $2.
- The cost of a dozen (12 roses) is $15.

First, we can calculate the cost of 15 roses using the price per rose:
\[
\text{Cost of 15 roses} = 15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills. To find out how much money she has:
\[
\text{Total money} = 5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the change Jenny receives

Now we need to find out how much change Jenny will receive after buying the roses. We subtract the cost of the roses from the amount of money she has:
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of roses} = 25 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = -5 \text{ dollars}
\]

This means that Jenny does not have enough money to buy the 15 roses, as she is short by $5.

### Step 4: Determine how many quarters she leaves with

Since Jenny cannot afford the 15 roses, she does not make the purchase. Therefore, she leaves with the same amount of money she arrived with, which is $25. 

To find out how many quarters are in $25, we convert dollars to quarters:
\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 100 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Final Answer

Since Jenny does not buy the roses and leaves with her original amount of money, she leaves with:
\[
\boxed{100} \text{ quarters}
\]
