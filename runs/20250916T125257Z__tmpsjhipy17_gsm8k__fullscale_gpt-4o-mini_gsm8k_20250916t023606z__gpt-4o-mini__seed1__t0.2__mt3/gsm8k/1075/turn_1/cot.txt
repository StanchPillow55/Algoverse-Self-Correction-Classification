To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 15 roses

Jenny has two pricing options for roses:
- **Individual price**: $2 per rose
- **Dozen price**: $15 for 12 roses

Since Jenny is buying 15 roses, we can calculate the cost using both pricing options.

1. **Cost for 12 roses**: 
   \[
   12 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   or 
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost for the remaining 3 roses**:
   \[
   3 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total cost for 15 roses**:
   \[
   15 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills:
\[
5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much more money Jenny needs

Jenny needs to pay $30 for the roses, but she only has $25. Therefore, she is short:
\[
30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much change she receives

Since Jenny cannot pay the full amount of $30 with only $25, she cannot complete the purchase. Therefore, she does not receive any change because she does not buy the roses.

### Step 5: Calculate the number of quarters she leaves with

Since Jenny did not buy any roses, she leaves with all the money she arrived with. She has $25 in cash, which we need to convert into quarters.

1. **Convert dollars to quarters**:
   \[
   1 \text{ dollar} = 4 \text{ quarters}
   \]
   Therefore, for $25:
   \[
   25 \text{ dollars} \times 4 \text{ quarters/dollar} = 100 \text{ quarters}
   \]

### Final Answer

Jenny leaves with **100 quarters**.
