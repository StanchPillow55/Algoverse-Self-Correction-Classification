To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has, and how much change she receives in quarters.

1. **Calculate the cost of the roses:**
   - Jenny buys 15 roses.
   - The cost of one rose is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 roses is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much money Jenny has:**
   - Jenny arrives with five $5 bills.
   - The total amount of money she has is:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much more money Jenny needs:**
   - The cost of the roses is $30, but she only has $25.
   - Therefore, the additional amount she needs is:
     \[
     \text{Additional amount needed} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 25 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine if she can buy the roses:**
   - Since Jenny does not have enough money to buy the 15 roses (she is short by $5), she cannot complete the purchase as planned.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Jenny cannot buy the roses, she does not spend any money and leaves with all her original money.
   - Therefore, she leaves with $25.

6. **Convert the remaining money into quarters:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25.
   - To find out how many quarters are in $25, we can calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters} = \frac{25 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 100 \text{ quarters}
     \]

Thus, Jenny leaves with **100 quarters**.

Final answer: **100 quarters**.
