To determine how many stickers Charlie has left, we will follow the problem step by step, keeping track of the number of stickers he has at each stage.

1. **Initial Stickers**: Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
   \[
   \text{Initial stickers} = 10
   \]

2. **Stickers Bought**: Charlie buys 21 stickers from a store.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after buying} = 10 + 21 = 31
   \]

3. **Birthday Stickers**: Charlie receives 23 stickers for his birthday.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after birthday} = 31 + 23 = 54
   \]

4. **Giving Stickers to Sister**: Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after giving to sister} = 54 - 9 = 45
   \]

5. **Using Stickers for Decoration**: Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after decorating} = 45 - 28 = 17
   \]

Now, we have calculated each step and tracked the number of stickers Charlie has after each transaction. 

Finally, the total number of stickers Charlie has left is:
\[
\text{Final answer} = 17
\]

Thus, Charlie has **17 stickers left**.
