To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points, given that after scoring those points, she has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Sara's Points**: 
   - Sara scored 8 points.

2. **Determine Erin's Points After Scoring**:
   - Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times \text{(Sara's points)}
   \]
   Substituting Sara's points:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

4. **Calculate Sara's Points Multiplied by 3**:
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for Erin's Points Before Scoring**:
   - To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is that Erin had **10 points** before scoring.
