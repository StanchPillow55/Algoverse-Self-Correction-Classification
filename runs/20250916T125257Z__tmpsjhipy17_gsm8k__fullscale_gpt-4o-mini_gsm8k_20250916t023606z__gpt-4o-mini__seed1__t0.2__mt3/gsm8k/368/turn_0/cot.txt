To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. Let's denote Erin's points before scoring 14 as \( E \).

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become \( E + 14 \).
   - We know that after scoring, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. Therefore, Sara's total points are 8.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, after scoring, Erin's points are three times Sara's points:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

3. **Calculating Sara's Points**:
   - We calculate \( 3 \times 8 \):
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   - So, we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

4. **Solving for Erin's Points Before Scoring**:
   - To find \( E \), we subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Erin had 10 points before scoring 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
