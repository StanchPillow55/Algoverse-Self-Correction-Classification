To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. We know that after scoring those points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Sara's total points**: 
   Sara scored 8 points. Therefore, her total points are:
   \[
   \text{Sara's points} = 8
   \]

2. **Determine Erin's points after scoring**: 
   Let \( E \) represent the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin's total points become:
   \[
   \text{Erin's total points} = E + 14
   \]

3. **Set up the equation based on the relationship between Erin's and Sara's points**: 
   According to the problem, after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times \text{Sara's points}
   \]
   Substituting Sara's points into the equation gives us:
   \[
   E + 14 = 3 \times 8
   \]

4. **Calculate the right side of the equation**:
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   So, we now have:
   \[
   E + 14 = 24
   \]

5. **Solve for \( E \)**:
   To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:
   \[
   E = 24 - 14
   \]
   \[
   E = 10
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Erin had 10 points before scoring the additional 14 points.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
