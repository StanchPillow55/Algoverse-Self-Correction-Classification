To determine how much Mandy should pay Benedict after 3 months, we need to calculate the total amount owed, including the interest accrued over that period.

1. **Initial Amount Owed**: Mandy owes Benedict $100.

2. **Monthly Interest Rate**: The interest rate is 2% per month. This means that each month, the amount owed increases by 2% of the current amount owed.

3. **Calculating Interest for Each Month**:
   - **Month 1**:
     - Interest for Month 1 = 2% of $100 = 0.02 × 100 = $2
     - Total Amount after Month 1 = $100 + $2 = $102

   - **Month 2**:
     - Interest for Month 2 = 2% of $102 = 0.02 × 102 = $2.04
     - Total Amount after Month 2 = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04

   - **Month 3**:
     - Interest for Month 3 = 2% of $104.04 = 0.02 × 104.04 = $2.0808
     - Total Amount after Month 3 = $104.04 + $2.0808 = $106.1208

4. **Final Amount Owed**: After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (rounded to two decimal places).

Thus, the final amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is **$106.12**.
