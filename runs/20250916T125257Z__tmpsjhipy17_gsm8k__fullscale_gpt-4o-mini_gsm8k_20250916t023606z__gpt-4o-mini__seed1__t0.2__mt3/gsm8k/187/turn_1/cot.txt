To solve the problem of how much Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months with a monthly interest rate of 2%, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount owed**: Mandy initially owes Benedict $100.

2. **Determine the monthly interest rate**: The monthly interest rate is given as 2%. This can be expressed as a decimal for calculations:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{2}{100} = 0.02
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount owed after each month**: The amount owed increases each month due to the interest. The formula to calculate the amount owed after one month with interest is:
   \[
   \text{New amount} = \text{Previous amount} \times (1 + \text{interest rate})
   \]

   We will apply this formula for each of the 3 months.

   - **After Month 1**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 1 month} = 100 \times (1 + 0.02) = 100 \times 1.02 = 102
     \]

   - **After Month 2**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 2 months} = 102 \times (1 + 0.02) = 102 \times 1.02 = 104.04
     \]

   - **After Month 3**:
     \[
     \text{Amount after 3 months} = 104.04 \times (1 + 0.02) = 104.04 \times 1.02 = 106.1208
     \]

4. **Final amount owed**: After 3 months, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is approximately $106.12 (rounded to two decimal places).

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the amount Mandy should give to Benedict after 3 months is:
   \[
   \boxed{106.12}
   \]
