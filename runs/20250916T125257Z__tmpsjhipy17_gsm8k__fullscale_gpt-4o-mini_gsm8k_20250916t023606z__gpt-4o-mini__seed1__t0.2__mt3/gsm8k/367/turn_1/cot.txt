Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks**:
   - We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting**:
   - The problem states that the number of shoplifters is equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for not wearing masks minus 5.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of shoplifters. Then we can express this as:
     \[
     S = 4 \times 3 - 5
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     S = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]
   - So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. **Calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence**:
   - The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.
   - Let \( V \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence. Then we can express this as:
     \[
     V = 3 \times S = 3 \times 7
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     V = 21
     \]
   - So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

4. **Calculate the total number of customers kicked out**:
   - Now, we can find the total number of customers kicked out for the three reasons we have calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = \text{Customers for masks} + \text{Shoplifters} + \text{Physical violence}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31
     \]

5. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons**:
   - The problem states that a total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart. To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total we calculated from the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = \text{Total kicked out} - \text{Total known reasons}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = 50 - 31 = 19
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **19 customers were kicked out for other reasons**.
