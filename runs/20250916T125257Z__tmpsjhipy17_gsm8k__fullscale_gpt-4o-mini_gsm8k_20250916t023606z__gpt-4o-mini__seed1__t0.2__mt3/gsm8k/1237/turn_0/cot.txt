To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School last Friday, we need to consider the total number of teachers, the number of teachers who were sick, and the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

1. **Total number of teachers**: There are 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School.

2. **Number of sick teachers**: Out of the 82 teachers, 13 were sick.

3. **Calculating the number of teachers who were present**:
   - We first find out how many teachers were not sick. This is done by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
     \[
     \text{Number of teachers not sick} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Sick teachers} = 82 - 13 = 69
     \]

4. **Number of substitute teachers**: There were 9 substitute teachers called in to help.

5. **Calculating the total number of teachers present at school**:
   - To find the total number of teachers present at school, we add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers:
     \[
     \text{Total teachers present} = \text{Teachers not sick} + \text{Substitute teachers} = 69 + 9 = 78
     \]

Thus, the total number of teachers at school that day, including both the teachers who were not sick and the substitute teachers, is 78.

**Final Answer**: 78 teachers were at school that day.
