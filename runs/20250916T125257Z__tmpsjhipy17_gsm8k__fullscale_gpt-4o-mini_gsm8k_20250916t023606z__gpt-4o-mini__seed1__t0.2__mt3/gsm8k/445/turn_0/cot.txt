To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes.**
   - The horse runs at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH).
   - First, we need to convert 30 minutes into hours:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Now, we can calculate the distance the horse runs in that time:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Determine how much hay the horse consumes.**
   - According to the problem, the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay for every mile it runs.
   - Therefore, for 16 miles, the amount of hay consumed is:
     \[
     \text{Hay consumed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the hay.**
   - Each bail of hay costs $3. Thus, the total cost for 8 bails is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Michael has.**
   - Michael has six 5 dollar bills:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate how much change Michael has after buying the hay.**
   - We subtract the total cost of the hay from the total money Michael has:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, Michael has **$6** in change after buying the hay.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
