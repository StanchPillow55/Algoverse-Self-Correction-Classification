To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle between the ground and the sun after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Pyramid**: The pyramid is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. This means that the top of the pyramid is 32 degrees above the horizontal ground level.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour upward from the pyramid. This means that for every hour that passes, the angle between the ground and the sun increases by 5 degrees.

3. **Total Movement of the Sun**: Since the sun moves for 10 hours, we can calculate the total degrees it moves upward:
   \[
   \text{Total movement} = \text{Rate of movement} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The final angle of the sun from the ground will be the initial angle of the pyramid plus the total movement of the sun:
   \[
   \text{Final angle} = \text{Initial angle} + \text{Total movement} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: After 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be 82 degrees.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{82 \text{ degrees}}
\]
