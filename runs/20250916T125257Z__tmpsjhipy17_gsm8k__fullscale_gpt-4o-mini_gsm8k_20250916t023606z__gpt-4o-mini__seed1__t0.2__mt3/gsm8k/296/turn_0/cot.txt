To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members consuming rice at every lunch and dinner, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household.**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = \text{Number of members} \times \text{Consumption per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \times 0.2 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day.**
   Since the household eats rice for both lunch and dinner, the total daily consumption will be:
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Total consumption per meal} \times \text{Number of meals per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = 1 \text{ kg} \times 2 = 2 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last.**
   To find out how many days the bag will last, we divide the total weight of the rice by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total weight of rice}}{\text{Total daily consumption}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert days into weeks.**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the total number of days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks** for the household of 5 members eating rice at every lunch and dinner.

Final answer: **3 weeks**
