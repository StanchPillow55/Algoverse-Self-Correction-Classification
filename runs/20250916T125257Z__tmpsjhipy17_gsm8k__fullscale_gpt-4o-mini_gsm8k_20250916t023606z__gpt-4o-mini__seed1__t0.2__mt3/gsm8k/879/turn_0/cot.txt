To solve the problem, we will break down the expenses that Iris incurred at the spa step by step.

1. **Cost of Hair**: 
   Iris spent $400 on her hair.

2. **Cost of Manicure**: 
   According to the problem, she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much on her manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Cost of Pedicure**: 
   The problem states that she spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much money on her pedicure as she did on her manicure. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: 
   Now, we will calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa by adding the costs of her hair, manicure, and pedicure together.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hair} + \text{Cost of Manicure} + \text{Cost of Pedicure}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 575
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \( \boxed{575} \).
