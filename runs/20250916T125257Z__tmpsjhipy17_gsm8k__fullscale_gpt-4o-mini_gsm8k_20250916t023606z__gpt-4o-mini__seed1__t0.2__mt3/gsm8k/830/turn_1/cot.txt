To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on her videos, songwriting, and makeup preparation.

1. **Time spent on TikTok videos:**
   - Britany records 18 videos each week.
   - Each video is 4 minutes long.
   - Total time spent on videos in one week:
     \[
     18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on videos is:
     \[
     72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent writing songs:**
   - Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.
   - Convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent writing songs is:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time spent on makeup:**
   - Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup each day for 6 days a week.
   - Total time spent on makeup in one week:
     \[
     15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]
   - For four weeks, the total time spent on makeup is:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time spent on TikTok in a month:**
   - Now, we add all the time spent on videos, songwriting, and makeup:
     \[
     288 \text{ minutes (videos)} + 480 \text{ minutes (songs)} + 360 \text{ minutes (makeup)} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1128 \text{ minutes}}
\]
