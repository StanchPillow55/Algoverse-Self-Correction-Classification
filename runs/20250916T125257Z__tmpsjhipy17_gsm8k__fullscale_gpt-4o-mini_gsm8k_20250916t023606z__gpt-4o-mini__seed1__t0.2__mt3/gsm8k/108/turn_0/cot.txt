Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, he wants to make twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake:

\[
2x
\]

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

After baking, he accidentally drops 5 cookies, which means the number of cookies he has left is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem that after dropping the cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies. Thus, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

To verify, if Henry baked 50 cookies last year, then he intended to bake:

\[
2 \times 50 = 100
\]

Adding the 15 extra cookies he baked gives:

\[
100 + 15 = 115
\]

After dropping 5 cookies, the total he has left is:

\[
115 - 5 = 110
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
