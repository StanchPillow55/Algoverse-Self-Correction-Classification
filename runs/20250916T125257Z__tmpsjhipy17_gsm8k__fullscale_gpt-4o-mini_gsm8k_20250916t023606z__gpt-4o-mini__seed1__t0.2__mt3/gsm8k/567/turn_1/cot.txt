To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Tooth**: Sharon received $5.00 for her first tooth.

   \[
   \text{Total after first tooth} = 5.00
   \]

2. **Next Three Teeth**: For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. 

   \[
   \text{Amount for next three teeth} = 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after first four teeth} = 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
   \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount she received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she received $1.00 for each of those three teeth, half of that is:

   \[
   \text{Amount for last two teeth} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1.00}{2}\right) = 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
   \]

   Adding this to the total:

   \[
   \text{Total after all teeth} = 8.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
   \]

Finally, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is:

\[
\boxed{9.00}
\]
