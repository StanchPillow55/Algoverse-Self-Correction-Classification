To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the total cost of the makeup artist's services, applying the discount at the end.

### Step 1: Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist
The makeup artist charges Jean $250 per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked per week
Jean requires the makeup artist for 6 hours each day, and she needs this service 4 times a week. Therefore, we calculate the total hours worked in a week as follows:

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 6 \, \text{hours/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 24 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total hours for the entire movie duration
The movie takes 5 weeks to finish. Thus, the total hours worked over the entire duration of the movie is:

\[
\text{Total hours for the movie} = \text{Total hours per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 24 \, \text{hours/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 120 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost before the discount
Now, we calculate the total cost for the makeup artist's services before applying the discount:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 120 \, \text{hours} \times 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the discount
The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost. We first calculate the amount of the discount:

\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Discount rate} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the final amount Jean pays
Finally, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean actually pays:

\[
\text{Final amount paid} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 30,000 \, \text{dollars} - 3,000 \, \text{dollars} = 27,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Jean pays a total of **$27,000** for the makeup artist's services after the discount.
