To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the hourly charge for the makeup artist:**
   The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of hours worked each day:**
   The makeup artist works for 6 hours each day.

3. **Calculate the daily cost for the makeup artist:**
   \[
   \text{Daily Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily Cost} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how many days the makeup artist works per week:**
   The makeup artist works 4 times a week.

5. **Calculate the weekly cost for the makeup artist:**
   \[
   \text{Weekly Cost} = \text{Daily Cost} \times \text{Days Worked per Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly Cost} = 1500 \, \text{dollars} \times 4 = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine the duration of the movie in weeks:**
   The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.

7. **Calculate the total cost for the entire duration of the movie:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Weekly Cost} \times \text{Number of Weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the discount given by the makeup artist:**
   The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Total Cost} \times 0.10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

9. **Calculate the final amount Jean has to pay after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services is **$27,000**.
