To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests after Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of pie.**

Grandma baked 5 pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. We can find the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie:

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie}
\]
\[
\text{Total pieces} = 5 \times 8 = 40
\]

So, there are a total of 40 pieces of pie.

**Step 2: Determine how many pieces were taken by the guests.**

At the end of the evening, it is stated that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

\[
\text{Pieces taken} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Remaining pieces}
\]
\[
\text{Pieces taken} = 40 - 14 = 26
\]

**Final Answer:**

The number of pieces taken by the guests is \( \boxed{26} \).
