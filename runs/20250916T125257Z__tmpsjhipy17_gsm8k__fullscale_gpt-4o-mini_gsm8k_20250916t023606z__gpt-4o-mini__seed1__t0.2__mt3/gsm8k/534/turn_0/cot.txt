To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Group Composition**:
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculating the Number of Shells Brought by Boys**:
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.
   - Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Girls' Contribution**:
   - The problem states that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - First, we need to calculate four times the number of shells brought by the boys:
     \[
     4 \times \text{Total shells by boys} = 4 \times 600 = 2400 \text{ shells}
     \]
   - Now, we can find the total number of shells brought back by the girls:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by girls} = \text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \times \text{Total shells by boys} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ shells}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Number of Shells Brought by Each Girl**:
   - Since there are 10 girls, we can find out how many shells each girl brought back by dividing the total number of shells brought back by the girls by the number of girls:
     \[
     \text{Shells per girl} = \frac{\text{Total shells by girls}}{\text{Number of girls}} = \frac{3000 \text{ shells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ shells/girl}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Each girl brought back **300 seashells**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]
