To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount.**
2. **Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.**
3. **Find the cost per pair of contacts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes after the discount

The original price of one box of contacts is $100.00. Since there is a 10% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one box:

\[
\text{Sale Price of One Box} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:

\[
\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts. Therefore, the total number of contacts in 2 boxes is:

\[
\text{Total Contacts} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts

A pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts. To find out how many pairs are in 180 contacts, we divide the total number of contacts by 2:

\[
\text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{180}{2} = 90
\]

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost of the 2 boxes by the number of pairs:

\[
\text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes}}{\text{Number of Pairs}} = \frac{180}{90} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

The cost of each pair of contacts is **$2.00**.
