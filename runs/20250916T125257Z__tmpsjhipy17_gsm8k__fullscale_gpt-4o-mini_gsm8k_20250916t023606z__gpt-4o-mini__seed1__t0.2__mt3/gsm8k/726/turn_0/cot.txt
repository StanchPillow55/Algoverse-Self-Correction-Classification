To solve the problem, we need to establish a relationship between the lengths of Topher's shoes and Bobby's shoes. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches**: 
   Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches. We need to convert this to inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
     \[
     8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Adding the additional 4 inches:
     \[
     96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}
     \]
   Thus, Topher's shoe length is 100 inches.

2. **Set up the equation**: 
   We know from the problem that the length of one of Topher’s shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes. Let \( b \) represent the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches. According to the problem, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   \text{Topher's shoe length} = 9b + 10
   \]
   Substituting the known length of Topher's shoe:
   \[
   100 = 9b + 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( b \)**:
   To isolate \( b \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   100 - 10 = 9b
   \]
   \[
   90 = 9b
   \]
   Next, we divide both sides by 9:
   \[
   b = \frac{90}{9} = 10
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   The length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( b = 10 \) inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
