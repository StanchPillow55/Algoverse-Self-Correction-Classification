To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: We know that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Let's denote the number of steps he completed on his walks to and from school as \( S \). Since he completed half of his total steps, we have:
   \[
   S = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also took an additional 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, we can add this to the steps he has already taken:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = S + 1,000 = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he realized he had only 2,000 steps left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. This means that before he started his jog, he had:
   \[
   \text{Steps before jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: We can find out how many steps he took during his jog by subtracting the total steps he had completed before the jog from the steps he had before the jog:
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = \text{Steps before jog} - \text{Total steps so far} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:

\[
\boxed{2,000}
\]
