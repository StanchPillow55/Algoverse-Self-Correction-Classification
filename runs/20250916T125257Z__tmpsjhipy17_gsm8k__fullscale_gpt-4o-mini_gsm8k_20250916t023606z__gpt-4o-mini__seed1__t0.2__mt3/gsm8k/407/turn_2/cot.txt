To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: He finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he aims for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: He also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend.

4. **Total Steps So Far**: Now, we can calculate the total number of steps Elliott has taken so far:
   \[
   \text{Total Steps} = \text{Steps from School} + \text{Steps from Walk with Friend} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Remaining Steps**: After his jog, he realized he had only 2,000 steps left to take. This means that before he started jogging, he had already taken:
   \[
   \text{Steps before Jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

6. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we can subtract the total steps he had taken before the jog from the total steps he had completed after the jog:
   \[
   \text{Steps during Jog} = \text{Steps before Jog} - \text{Steps so far} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2,000}
\]
