To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott aims to walk a total of 10,000 steps in a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School**: It is mentioned that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he is aiming for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \text{Steps from school} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, we add this to the steps he has already completed:
   \[
   \text{Total steps so far} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Steps Remaining After Jog**: After finishing his jog, he realized he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the total number of steps he has taken after his jog can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Steps after jog} = 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Taken During the Jog**: To find out how many steps he took during his jog, we need to determine how many steps he had taken before the jog and then subtract that from the total steps after the jog. We already calculated that he had taken 6,000 steps before the jog. Therefore, the steps taken during the jog can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = \text{Total steps after jog} - \text{Steps before jog}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Steps during jog} = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is **2,000 steps**.

Final answer: **2,000 steps**.
