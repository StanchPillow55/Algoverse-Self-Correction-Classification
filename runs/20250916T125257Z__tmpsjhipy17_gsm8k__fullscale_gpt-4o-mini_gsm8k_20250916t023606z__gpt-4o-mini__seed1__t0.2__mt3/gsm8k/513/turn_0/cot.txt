To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate how much money Julie has left after her purchases.

1. **Calculate the amount spent on clothes:**
   Julie initially has $500. She spends 20% of this amount on clothes.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 20\% \text{ of } 500 = \frac{20}{100} \times 500 = 0.2 \times 500 = 100
   \]

   After spending on clothes, we need to find out how much money Julie has left.

   \[
   \text{Money left after buying clothes} = 500 - 100 = 400
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on CDs:**
   Now, Julie has $400 left. She spends 25% of this remaining amount on CDs.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 25\% \text{ of } 400 = \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
   \]

   After spending on CDs, we again need to find out how much money Julie has left.

   \[
   \text{Money left after buying CDs} = 400 - 100 = 300
   \]

3. **Final Calculation:**
   After both purchases, Julie has $300 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{300}
\]
