To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we need to break down the costs based on the items she has and the services provided by the interior design firm.

1. **Base Installation Cost**: The firm charges a flat fee of $129.00 for the installation of a specific set of items:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Angela's Items**: Angela has the following items that need installation:
   - 6 mirrors
   - 2 chandeliers
   - 20 pictures

3. **Calculating Additional Items**:
   - **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, but the base installation covers only 4 mirrors. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     6 - 4 = 2 \text{ additional mirrors}
     \]
   - **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the base installation covers only 1 chandelier. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     2 - 1 = 1 \text{ additional chandelier}
     \]
   - **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, but the base installation covers only 10 pictures. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     20 - 10 = 10 \text{ additional pictures}
     \]

4. **Total Additional Items**: Now we can calculate the total number of additional items Angela needs installed:
   \[
   \text{Total additional items} = 2 \text{ (mirrors)} + 1 \text{ (chandelier)} + 10 \text{ (pictures)} = 13 \text{ additional items}
   \]

5. **Cost for Additional Items**: The firm charges $15.00 for each additional item. Therefore, the cost for the additional items is:
   \[
   13 \text{ items} \times 15 \text{ dollars/item} = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost**: Now we can calculate the total cost for Angela's installation by adding the base installation cost to the cost of the additional items:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 129 \text{ dollars (base cost)} + 195 \text{ dollars (additional items)} = 324 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final cost for Angela's installation is:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]
