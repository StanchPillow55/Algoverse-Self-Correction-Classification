To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats based on the information given about Amir, and then find the total number of cookies both of them eat together.

1. **Identify how many cookies Amir eats**: 
   According to the problem, Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Cody eats**: 
   The problem states that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. Since Amir eats 5 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both**: 
   Now that we know how many cookies each person eats, we can find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir:

   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 5 + 15 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of cookies that both Cody and Amir eat together is:

   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]
