To determine how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Craig initially has.**
   - Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills.
   - Total money = 2 bills × $20/bill = $40.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the squirt guns.**
   - Craig buys 6 squirt guns at $2 each.
   - Total cost of squirt guns = 6 squirt guns × $2/squirt gun = $12.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water balloons.**
   - Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons at $3 each.
   - Total cost of water balloons = 3 packs × $3/pack = $9.

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items purchased.**
   - Total cost = Total cost of squirt guns + Total cost of water balloons
   - Total cost = $12 + $9 = $21.

5. **Calculate how much money Craig has left after his purchases.**
   - Money left = Initial amount - Total cost
   - Money left = $40 - $21 = $19.

Thus, after completing all calculations and reasoning, Craig has **$19** left. 

Final answer: **$19**.
