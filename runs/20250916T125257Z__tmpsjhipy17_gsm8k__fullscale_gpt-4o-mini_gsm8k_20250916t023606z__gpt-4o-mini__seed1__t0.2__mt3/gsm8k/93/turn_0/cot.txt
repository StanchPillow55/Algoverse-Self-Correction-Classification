To solve the problem, we need to determine how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his diet, given that Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds and is 2 seconds faster than Gerald.

### Step 1: Determine Gerald's original time

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds and that he is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find Gerald's original time:

\[
\text{Lee's time} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Substituting Lee's time into the equation:

\[
38 \text{ seconds} = \text{Gerald's time} - 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we can solve for Gerald's time:

\[
\text{Gerald's time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's improved time

Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find his new time, we first need to determine how much faster he is running. A 10% improvement means he will run the distance in 90% of his original time.

To find 90% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds), we calculate:

\[
\text{Improved time} = \text{Original time} \times (1 - \text{Improvement percentage})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds**.
