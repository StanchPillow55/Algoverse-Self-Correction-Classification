To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding Lee's and Gerald's original times**:
   - We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
   - According to the problem, Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can find Gerald's original time by adding 2 seconds to Lee's time:
     \[
     \text{Gerald's original time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Calculating Gerald's improved time**:
   - Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how this affects his running time, we first need to determine what 10% of his original time is.
   - 10% of Gerald's original time (40 seconds) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - This means that with the improvement, Gerald's time will decrease by 4 seconds.

3. **Finding Gerald's new time**:
   - To find Gerald's new time after the improvement, we subtract the 4 seconds from his original time:
     \[
     \text{Gerald's new time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{improvement} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
