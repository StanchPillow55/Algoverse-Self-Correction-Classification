Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Let \( N \) be the number of candies Nick has.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of candies George has.
   - According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     N = 2G
     \]

2. **George's situation**: 
   - The problem states that George ate 5 candies and now has 3 candies left. We can express this mathematically:
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]
   - To find out how many candies George originally had, we can solve for \( G \):
     \[
     G = 3 + 5
     \]
     \[
     G = 8
     \]

3. **Finding Nick's candies**: 
   - Now that we know George has 8 candies, we can substitute this value back into the equation for Nick's candies:
     \[
     N = 2G = 2 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     N = 16
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
