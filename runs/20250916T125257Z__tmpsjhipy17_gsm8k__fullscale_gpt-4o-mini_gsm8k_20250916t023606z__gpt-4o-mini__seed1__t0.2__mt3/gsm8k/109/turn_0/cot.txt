To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon, and then determine the cashback amount that will be received from the app company.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas before cashback
The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Price per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cashback amount
The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon. To find the total cashback for 10 gallons, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Total cashback} = \text{Cashback per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total cashback} = 0.20 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the final cost after cashback
To find the final cost after applying the cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[
\text{Final cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cashback}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Final cost} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars} - 2.00 \, \text{dollars} = 28.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The final amount that the person will pay for 10 gallons of gas, after receiving the cashback rewards, is:

\[
\boxed{28.00 \, \text{dollars}}
\]
