To determine the total number of trees planted at Ashley's school, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by both the students and the teachers.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students

The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. We can find the total number of students by multiplying the number of classes by the average number of students per class:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Average students per class}
\]
\[
\text{Total students} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of teachers

Each class has an average of 3 teachers. We can find the total number of teachers by multiplying the number of classes by the average number of teachers per class:

\[
\text{Total teachers} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Average teachers per class}
\]
\[
\text{Total teachers} = 40 \times 3 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by students

Each student plants 1 tree. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by students is equal to the total number of students:

\[
\text{Trees planted by students} = \text{Total students} \times 1
\]
\[
\text{Trees planted by students} = 1000 \times 1 = 1000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers

Each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

\[
\text{Trees planted by teachers} = \text{Total teachers} \times 2
\]
\[
\text{Trees planted by teachers} = 120 \times 2 = 240
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted

To find the total number of trees planted by both students and teachers, we add the number of trees planted by students to the number of trees planted by teachers:

\[
\text{Total trees planted} = \text{Trees planted by students} + \text{Trees planted by teachers}
\]
\[
\text{Total trees planted} = 1000 + 240 = 1240
\]

### Final Answer

At the end of the campaign, the total number of trees planted will be:

\[
\boxed{1240}
\]
