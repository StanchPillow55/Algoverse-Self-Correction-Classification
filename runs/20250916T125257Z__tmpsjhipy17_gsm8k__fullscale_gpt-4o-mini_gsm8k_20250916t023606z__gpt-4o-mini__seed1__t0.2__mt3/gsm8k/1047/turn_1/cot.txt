Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{First set} = x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Third set} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is 19:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

Now, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, we can rewrite the equation:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \). The common denominator is 2:
\[
2x = \frac{4x}{2}
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Combining the fractions:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Next, we isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 19 - 4
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Thus, the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
