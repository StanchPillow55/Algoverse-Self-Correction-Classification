Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set. 

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Thus, the number of balls retrieved in the third set can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of tennis balls retrieved across all three sets. The total is given as 19 balls:
\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, we can rewrite \( x + 4 \) and \( x \) as:
\[
x + 4 + x = 2x + 4
\]

Now, we can add \( \frac{x}{2} \) to this:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \) is 2. We can rewrite \( 2x \) as \( \frac{4x}{2} \):
\[
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = \frac{4x + x}{2} + 4 = \frac{5x}{2} + 4
\]

Now, we can substitute this back into our equation:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
\]

Next, we will isolate \( \frac{5x}{2} \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 19 - 4
\]
\[
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by 2:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), which is the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set, we can find the number of balls retrieved in the first set:
\[
\text{First set} = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

Finally, we can verify our solution by calculating the total number of balls retrieved in all three sets:
- First set: \( 10 \)
- Second set: \( 6 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Adding these together:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

Since this matches the total given in the problem, our solution is confirmed.

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
