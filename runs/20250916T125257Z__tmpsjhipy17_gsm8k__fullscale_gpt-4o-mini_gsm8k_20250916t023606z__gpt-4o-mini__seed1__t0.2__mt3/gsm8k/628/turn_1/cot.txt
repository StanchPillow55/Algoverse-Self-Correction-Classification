To determine how many years it will take for Adam to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert Adam's height from inches to feet**: 
   - We know that there are 12 inches in a foot. 
   - Adam's current height is 40 inches. 
   - To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:
     \[
     \text{Height in feet} = \frac{40 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} \approx 3.33 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine the height requirement**: 
   - The height requirement to ride the roller coaster is 4 feet.

3. **Calculate the height difference**: 
   - We need to find out how much taller Adam needs to be to meet the height requirement:
     \[
     \text{Height needed} = 4 \text{ feet} - 3.33 \text{ feet} = 0.67 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Convert the height difference back to inches**: 
   - Since we are more familiar with inches for Adam's growth, we convert 0.67 feet back to inches:
     \[
     \text{Height difference in inches} = 0.67 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} \approx 8 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Determine Adam's growth rate**: 
   - Adam grows 2 inches per year.

6. **Calculate how many years it will take for Adam to grow the necessary height**: 
   - We need to find out how many years it will take for Adam to grow 8 inches at a rate of 2 inches per year:
     \[
     \text{Years needed} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
     \]

7. **Final answer**: 
   - Adam will be tall enough to ride the roller coaster in **4 years**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
