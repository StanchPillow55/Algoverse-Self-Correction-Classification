To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem statement. Let's denote the amounts of each ingredient in ounces as follows:

- Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
- Let \( f \) be the amount of fragrance (in ounces).
- Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
- Let \( o \) be the amount of oil (in ounces).
- Let \( g \) be the amount of sugar (in ounces).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The amount of citrus zest is equal to the amount of fragrance:
   \[
   z = f
   \]

2. The amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar:
   \[
   s = g
   \]

3. The amount of oil is twice the amount of salt:
   \[
   o = 2s
   \]

4. The amount of salt is twice the amount of citrus zest:
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now, we know that the total amount of all ingredients must equal 10 ounces:
\[
z + f + s + o + g = 10
\]

Now, we can substitute the relationships we have into this equation. First, we can substitute \( f \) with \( z \) (from equation 1) and \( g \) with \( s \) (from equation 2). This gives us:
\[
z + z + s + o + s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 2s + o = 10
\]

Next, we can substitute \( o \) with \( 2s \) (from equation 3):
\[
2z + 2s + 2s = 10
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2z + 4s = 10
\]

Now, we can divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
z + 2s = 5
\]

Next, we can substitute \( s \) with \( 2z \) (from equation 4):
\[
z + 2(2z) = 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
z + 4z = 5
\]
\[
5z = 5
\]
Dividing both sides by 5 gives us:
\[
z = 1
\]

Now that we have \( z \), we can find \( s \):
\[
s = 2z = 2(1) = 2
\]

Next, we can find \( o \):
\[
o = 2s = 2(2) = 4
\]

Finally, we can summarize the amounts of each ingredient:
- \( z = 1 \) ounce (citrus zest)
- \( f = 1 \) ounce (fragrance)
- \( s = 2 \) ounces (salt)
- \( o = 4 \) ounces (oil)
- \( g = 2 \) ounces (sugar)

Now, we can check that the total adds up to 10 ounces:
\[
1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10
\]

Thus, the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.
