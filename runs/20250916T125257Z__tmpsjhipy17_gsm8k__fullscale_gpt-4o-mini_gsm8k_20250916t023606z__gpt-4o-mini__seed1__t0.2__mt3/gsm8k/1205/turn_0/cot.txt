To find out how many miles the last dog needs to walk, we can use the information given about the other dogs and the average requirement.

1. **Identify the known values:**
   - Dog 1: 1 mile
   - Dog 2: 4 miles
   - Dog 3: 3 miles
   - Dog 4: \( x \) miles (this is what we need to find)
   - Average requirement for all dogs: 3 miles

2. **Calculate the total miles required for all dogs:**
   Since the average requirement for the dogs is 3 miles, we can find the total miles needed for all 4 dogs by multiplying the average by the number of dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Average} \times \text{Number of dogs} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 4 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Now we can express the total miles in terms of the known values and the unknown \( x \):
   \[
   1 + 4 + 3 + x = 12
   \]

4. **Combine the known values:**
   Adding the miles walked by the first three dogs:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 3 = 8
   \]
   So the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   8 + x = 12
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 12 - 8
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The last dog needs to walk **4 miles**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
