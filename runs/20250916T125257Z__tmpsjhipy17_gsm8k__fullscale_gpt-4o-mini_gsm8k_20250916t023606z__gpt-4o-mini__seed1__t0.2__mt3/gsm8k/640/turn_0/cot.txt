To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up with the base price of the truck. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: 
   \[
   \text{Base Price} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the King Cab Upgrade**: 
   \[
   \text{King Cab Upgrade} = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Leather Seats**: 
   The leather seats cost one-third of the cost of the king cab upgrade. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{King Cab Upgrade} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Running Boards**: 
   The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = \text{Leather Seats} - 500 = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: 
   \[
   \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we can sum all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:

6. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
   \]

7. **Performing the Addition**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
   \]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:
\[
\boxed{43,500} \text{ dollars}
\]
