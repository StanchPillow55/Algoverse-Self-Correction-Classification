To determine how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has taken from the age of 23 to 34, and then multiply that by the number of shirts (or quilt blocks) he has from each vacation.

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**
   - Gene is currently 34 years old.
   - He started vacationing at the age of 23.
   - The number of years he has been vacationing is:
     \[
     34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Therefore, the total number of vacations he has taken over the 11 years is:
     \[
     11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of quilt blocks:**
   - Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block (one shirt), the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the total number of vacations.
   - Thus, the total number of quilt blocks is:
     \[
     44 \text{ quilt blocks}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**.
