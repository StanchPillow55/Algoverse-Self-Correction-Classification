To find out how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to determine how many vacations he has taken since he started vacationing at the age of 23 until he is now 34.

1. **Calculate the number of years he has been vacationing:**
   - Current age: 34 years
   - Starting age: 23 years
   - Number of years vacationing = Current age - Starting age
   \[
   34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vacations taken:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.
   - Total vacations = Number of years vacationing Ã— Vacations per year
   \[
   11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
   \]

3. **Determine the total number of quilt blocks:**
   - Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block.
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations.
   \[
   \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44
   \]

Thus, Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**.
