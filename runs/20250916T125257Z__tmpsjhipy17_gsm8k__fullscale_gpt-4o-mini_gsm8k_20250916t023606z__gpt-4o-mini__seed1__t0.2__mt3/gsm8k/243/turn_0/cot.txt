To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he has used this month and then subtract that from his total allowance of 1000 minutes.

1. **Calculate the total minutes used for daily calls with his boss:**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - The month has 30 days.
   - Total minutes used for calls with his boss = 15 minutes/day Ã— 30 days = 450 minutes.

2. **Add the extra minutes used:**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss + Extra minutes = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

3. **Calculate the remaining minutes:**
   - Jason's total phone plan allowance is 1000 minutes.
   - Remaining minutes = Total allowance - Total minutes used = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Thus, after calculating the total minutes used and subtracting from the total allowance, we find that Jason has 250 minutes left.

**Final Answer: Jason has 250 minutes left.**
