To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn based on the information given.

1. **Identify Quinn's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Quinn is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Jane's Age**: 
   The problem states that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's Age} = \text{Quinn's Age} - 3
   \]
   Substituting Quinn's age:
   \[
   \text{Jane's Age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]

3. **Determine Trent's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. We can calculate Trent's age using Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's Age} = \text{Jane's Age} + 5
   \]
   Substituting Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's Age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

Now that we have calculated Trent's age, we can summarize our findings:

- Quinn is 30 years old.
- Jane is 27 years old.
- Trent is 32 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Trent's Age} = 32
\]
