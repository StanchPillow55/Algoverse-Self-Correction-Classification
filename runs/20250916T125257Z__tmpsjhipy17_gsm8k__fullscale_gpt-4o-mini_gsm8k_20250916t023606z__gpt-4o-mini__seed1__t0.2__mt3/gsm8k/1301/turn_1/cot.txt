To solve the problem, we will track the number of cookies Randy has after each action he takes. We will start with the initial quantities of each type of cookie and then adjust these quantities step by step based on the actions described.

1. **Initial Cookie Counts**:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 9
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 4
   - Sugar cookies: 5

2. **Randy eats 3 cookies (one of each flavor)**:
   - He eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie.
   - After eating:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(9 - 1 = 8\)
     - Chocolate chip cookies: \(4 - 1 = 3\)
     - Sugar cookies: \(5 - 1 = 4\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 8
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 4

3. **Randy eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch**:
   - After eating 2 more oatmeal cookies:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(8 - 2 = 6\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 4

4. **Randy gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends**:
   - After giving away 2 sugar cookies:
     - Sugar cookies: \(4 - 2 = 2\)

   Current counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 6
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 3
   - Sugar cookies: 2

5. **Randy bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner**:
   - He bakes 4 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies.
   - After baking:
     - Oatmeal cookies: \(6 + 4 = 10\)
     - Chocolate chip cookies: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
     - Sugar cookies: \(2 + 4 = 6\)

   Final counts:
   - Oatmeal cookies: 10
   - Chocolate chip cookies: 7
   - Sugar cookies: 6

6. **Total Cookies**:
   To find the total number of cookies Randy has now, we sum the counts of each type:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Randy has **23 cookies** now.
