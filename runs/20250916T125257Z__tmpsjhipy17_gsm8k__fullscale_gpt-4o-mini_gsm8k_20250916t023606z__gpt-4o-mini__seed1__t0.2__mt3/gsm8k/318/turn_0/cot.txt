To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of children in the classroom based on the information provided about the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children.

1. **Identify the number of boys**: 
   The problem states that there are 30 boys in the classroom.

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of girls**: 
   According to the problem, there are 3 times as many girls as there are boys. Therefore, we can calculate the number of girls as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{Number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of nongendered children**: 
   The problem also states that there are \( \frac{1}{10} \) as many nongendered children as there are boys. We can calculate the number of nongendered children as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times \text{Number of boys} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of children**: 
   Now that we have the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children, we can find the total number of children in the classroom by adding these three quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of nongendered children}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total number of children} = 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of children in the classroom is 

   \[
   \boxed{123}
   \]
