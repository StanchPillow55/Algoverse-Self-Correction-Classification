To determine the total distance Mason has traveled on his bike journey, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance traveled during the first part of the journey and the distance traveled during the second part.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first part of the journey.

Mason's speed is 8 miles per hour, and he travels for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the first part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same speed of 8 miles per hour. We will use the same formula for distance:

For the second part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours

Now we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

To find the total distance Mason has traveled, we simply add the distances from both parts of the journey:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer:

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.
