To find out how many miles Mason has traveled in total, we can break the problem down into two parts: the distance he travels during the first segment of his journey and the distance he travels during the second segment. 

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for the first part of the journey.

Mason travels at a speed of 8 miles per hour for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance, which is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For the first part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 4 hours

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_1 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance for the second part of the journey.

After taking a rest, Mason continues his journey for another 6 hours at the same speed of 8 miles per hour. We will again use the same distance formula.

For the second part of the journey:

- Speed = 8 miles per hour
- Time = 6 hours

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled.

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by adding the distances from both parts of the journey:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2
\]

Substituting the distances we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = 80 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Mason has traveled a total of **80 miles**.
