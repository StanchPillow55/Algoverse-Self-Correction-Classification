To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we first need to calculate the total cost for one trip to the movies, which includes the ticket and popcorn.

1. **Calculate the cost of one trip:**
   - Cost of the movie ticket = $7
   - Cost of popcorn = $7
   - Total cost for one trip = Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one trip} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trips he can afford:**
   - Peter has a total of $42 for the week.
   - To find out how many trips he can afford, we divide his total money by the cost of one trip.
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per trip}} = \frac{42}{14}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3
   \]

Thus, Peter can go to the movies **3 times** this week.

**Final Answer:**
Peter can go to the movies 3 times.
