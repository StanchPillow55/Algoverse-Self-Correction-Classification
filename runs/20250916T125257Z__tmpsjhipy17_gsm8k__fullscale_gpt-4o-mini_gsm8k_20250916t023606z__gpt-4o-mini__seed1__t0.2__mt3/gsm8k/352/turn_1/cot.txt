To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Andrea saved before she spent some of it on a sweater and gave some to her brother.

1. **Identify the total amount Andrea had initially**: 
   - Andrea started with $36.

2. **Identify the amounts spent**:
   - She spent $11 on a sweater.
   - She gave her brother $4.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   - Total spent = Cost of sweater + Amount given to brother
   - Total spent = $11 + $4 = $15

4. **Calculate the amount of money left after spending**:
   - Amount left = Initial amount - Total spent
   - Amount left = $36 - $15 = $21

5. **Determine how much Andrea saved**:
   - Since we know that after spending $15, Andrea has $21 left, we can conclude that the amount she saved is the difference between her initial amount and the amount she has left after spending.
   - Amount saved = Initial amount - Amount left
   - Amount saved = $36 - $21 = $15

Thus, Andrea saved **$15** before she made her purchases.

**Final Answer**: Andrea saved $15.
