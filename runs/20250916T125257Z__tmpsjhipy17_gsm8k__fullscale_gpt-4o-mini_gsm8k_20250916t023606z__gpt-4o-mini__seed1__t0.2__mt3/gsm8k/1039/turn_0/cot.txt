To determine how much fabric Jim needs to buy for his comforter, we first need to calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces he requires based on the size of his king-sized bed.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the bed:**
   - Length of the bed = 6 feet
   - Width of the bed = 8 feet

2. **Calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces:**
   - Jim needs each piece of fabric to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.
   - Length of each fabric piece = Length of the bed + 2 feet
     \[
     \text{Length of each fabric piece} = 6 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Width of each fabric piece = Width of the bed + 2 feet
     \[
     \text{Width of each fabric piece} = 8 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of one piece of fabric:**
   - Area of one piece of fabric = Length Ã— Width
     \[
     \text{Area of one piece} = 8 \text{ feet} \times 10 \text{ feet} = 80 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Determine the total area of fabric needed:**
   - Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, we multiply the area of one piece by 2.
     \[
     \text{Total area of fabric} = 2 \times 80 \text{ square feet} = 160 \text{ square feet}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Jim needs to buy a total of **160 square feet** of fabric for his comforter.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
