To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after receiving a promotion, we need to calculate his new monthly salary after the raise, the bonus he will receive, and then find his total annual income.

### Step 1: Calculate the raise
Tim's current monthly salary is $20,000. He receives a 5% raise.

To calculate the amount of the raise:
\[
\text{Raise} = \text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}
\]
\[
\text{Raise} = 20000 \times 0.05 = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the new monthly salary
Now, we add the raise to his current salary to find his new monthly salary:
\[
\text{New Monthly Salary} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Raise}
\]
\[
\text{New Monthly Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the bonus
The bonus is worth half a month's salary based on his new monthly salary. Therefore, we calculate half of his new monthly salary:
\[
\text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{New Monthly Salary}
\]
\[
\text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 21000 = 10500
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total annual income
To find Tim's total income for the year, we need to consider both his new monthly salary and the bonus. First, we calculate his total salary for the year without the bonus:
\[
\text{Annual Salary} = \text{New Monthly Salary} \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Annual Salary} = 21000 \times 12 = 252000
\]

Now, we add the bonus to the annual salary:
\[
\text{Total Annual Income} = \text{Annual Salary} + \text{Bonus}
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Income} = 252000 + 10500 = 262500
\]

### Final Answer
Tim will make a total of **$262,500** in a year after his promotion.
