To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of eggs Claire eats in one day**:
   Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning. Therefore, the number of eggs she eats in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Eggs per day} = 3
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of days in 4 weeks**:
   There are 7 days in a week. Therefore, in 4 weeks, the total number of days is:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks**:
   Since she eats 3 eggs each day, the total number of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Total days} = 3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens**:
   A dozen is equal to 12 eggs. To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
   \[
   \text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 7 \text{ dozens}
   \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations and reasoning through the problem, we find that Claire will eat a total of:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]

dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.
