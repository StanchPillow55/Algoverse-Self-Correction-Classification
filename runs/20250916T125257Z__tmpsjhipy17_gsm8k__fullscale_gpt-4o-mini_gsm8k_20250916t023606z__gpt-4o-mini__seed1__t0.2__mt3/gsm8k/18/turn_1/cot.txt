To determine how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in one week:**
   - Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs she uses in one week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of eggs Claire uses in 4 weeks:**
   - Now we multiply the number of eggs she uses in one week by 4 to find out how many eggs she uses in 4 weeks:
     \[
     21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the total number of eggs into dozens:**
   - There are 12 eggs in a dozen. To find out how many dozens are in 84 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Claire will eat **7 dozens of eggs** in 4 weeks.
