To find the total amount Catherine pays at the grocery store, we will calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum those costs.

1. **Cost of Apples**:
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Cost of apples = 1 kilo × $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Cost of Bananas**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Cost of bananas = 2 kilos × $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Cost of Oranges**:
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Cost of oranges = 2 kilos × $3/kilo = $6.

4. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we add the costs of all the fruits:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Apples} + \text{Cost of Bananas} + \text{Cost of Oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 4 + 4 + 6 = 14.
   \]

Thus, Catherine pays a total of **$14**. 

Final answer: **$14**.
