To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Ryan's total allowance after 3 weeks.**
   - Ryan earns $6 each week for completing his chores.
   - He did his chores for 3 weeks, so we calculate his total allowance as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Allowance} = \text{Weekly Allowance} \times \text{Number of Weeks} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.**
   - Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought a total of 4 cones (1 for himself and 3 for his friends).
   - The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25, so we calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of Ice Cream} = \text{Number of Cones} \times \text{Cost per Cone} = 4 \times 1.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream.**
   - We subtract the total cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance:
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = \text{Total Allowance} - \text{Total Cost of Ice Cream} = 18 - 5 = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.**
   - The cost of each movie ticket is $6.50. To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one ticket:
     \[
     \text{Number of Tickets} = \frac{\text{Money Left}}{\text{Cost per Ticket}} = \frac{13}{6.50}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{13}{6.50} = 2
     \]
   - Since Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a ticket, we take the whole number part of the result, which is 2.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Ryan can buy **2 movie tickets**.
