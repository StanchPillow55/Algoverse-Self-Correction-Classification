To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to break down each component of the charges and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the cast**: 
   - The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
   - Cost of the cast = $200

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**:
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour for the visit.
   - Since Hannah's visit lasts for 30 minutes, we need to convert this time into hours. 
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, which can be expressed as \(0.5\) hours.
   - Therefore, the cost for the visit is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of visit} = 300 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of painkillers**:
   - The doctor charges $4 per pill for 30 painkillers.
   - The total cost for the painkillers is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of painkillers} = 4 \, \text{dollars/pill} \times 30 \, \text{pills} = 120 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of parking**:
   - The doctor charges $6 per hour for parking, with a mandatory minimum of 2 hours.
   - Therefore, the cost for parking is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of parking} = 6 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Now, we will sum all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cast} + \text{Cost of visit} + \text{Cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 150 \, \text{dollars} + 120 \, \text{dollars} + 12 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

1. \(200 + 150 = 350\)
2. \(350 + 120 = 470\)
3. \(470 + 12 = 482\)

Thus, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is:

\[
\boxed{482} \, \text{dollars}
\]
