Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught, \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught, and \( D \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught. We are given the following information:

1. The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is 339:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \):
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into equation (1):
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides yields:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing both sides by 9 gives:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now we can check our work by verifying the total:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
