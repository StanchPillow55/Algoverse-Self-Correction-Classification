To solve the problem, we will define the number of students needing each shirt size based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Extra-small shirts**: 
   - We know that 11 students need size extra-small.
   \[
   \text{Extra-small} = 11
   \]

2. **Small shirts**: 
   - The problem states that twice as many students need size small as extra-small. Therefore, we calculate the number of small shirts as follows:
   \[
   \text{Small} = 2 \times \text{Extra-small} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium shirts**: 
   - It is stated that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Thus, we calculate the number of medium shirts:
   \[
   \text{Medium} = \text{Small} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large shirts**: 
   - The problem indicates that half as many students need size large as size medium. Therefore, we calculate the number of large shirts:
   \[
   \text{Large} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Medium} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-large shirts**: 
   - Finally, it is mentioned that six more students need size extra-large than large. Thus, we calculate the number of extra-large shirts:
   \[
   \text{Extra-large} = \text{Large} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now that we have calculated the number of shirts needed for each size, we can sum them up to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.

6. **Total shirts**:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Extra-small} + \text{Small} + \text{Medium} + \text{Large} + \text{Extra-large}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
   \]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
- First, add the extra-small and small:
  \[
  11 + 22 = 33
  \]
- Next, add medium:
  \[
  33 + 18 = 51
  \]
- Then, add large:
  \[
  51 + 9 = 60
  \]
- Finally, add extra-large:
  \[
  60 + 15 = 75
  \]

Thus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
