To calculate Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to determine the total cost of making the jars and then subtract that from the total revenue from selling them.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.

1. **Passion Fruit**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $6
   - Total cost for passion fruit: 
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Jackfruit**:
   - Amount needed: 1.5 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $8
   - Total cost for jackfruit: 
     \[
     1.5 \text{ pounds} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Special Honey**:
   - Amount needed: 2 pounds
   - Cost per pound: $10
   - Total cost for honey: 
     \[
     2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for one jar.

Now, we sum the costs of all ingredients for one jar:
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = \text{Cost of passion fruit} + \text{Cost of jackfruit} + \text{Cost of honey}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = 12 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.

To find the total cost for 10 jars, we multiply the cost of one jar by 10:
\[
\text{Total cost for 10 jars} = 44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.

Tim sells each jar for $50, so the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit.

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 500 \text{ dollars} - 440 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Tim makes a profit of **$60** from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix.
