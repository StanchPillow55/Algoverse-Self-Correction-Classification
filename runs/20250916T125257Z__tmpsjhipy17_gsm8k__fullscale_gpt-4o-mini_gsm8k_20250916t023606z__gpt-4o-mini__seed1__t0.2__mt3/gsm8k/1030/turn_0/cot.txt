To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the probabilities given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a 50% probability), we need to consider two sub-scenarios:
     - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give an extension. If this happens, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given**: If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a 60% probability), we then consider whether Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.
       - **Convincing the Teacher**: There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he will not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Not Convincing the Teacher**: If he does not convince her (which happens with an 80% probability), he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of having to turn in homework with the normal teacher.

- Probability of having the normal teacher = 50% = 0.5
- Probability of getting an extension from the normal teacher = 40% = 0.4
- Probability of not getting an extension = 60% = 0.6
- Probability of convincing the teacher for a personal extension = 20% = 0.2
- Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% = 0.8

Now, if the normal teacher is present:
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the teacher is present:
  - This occurs only if he does not get an extension and does not convince the teacher.
  
  \[
  P(\text{Turn in homework | Normal teacher}) = P(\text{No extension}) \times P(\text{Not convincing}) = 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.48
  \]

### Step 2: Combine the probabilities.

Now we combine the probabilities of the two main scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

- Probability of having to turn in homework if the substitute teacher is present = 0% = 0
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present = 0.5 (probability of normal teacher) * 0.48 (probability of having to turn in homework with normal teacher)

\[
P(\text{Turn in homework}) = P(\text{Substitute}) \times 0 + P(\text{Normal}) \times P(\text{Turn in homework | Normal}) 
\]
\[
= 0.5 \times 0 + 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.
