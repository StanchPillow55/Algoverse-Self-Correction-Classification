To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the probabilities given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher. If there is a substitute, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If there is no substitute teacher (which happens with a probability of 50%), we need to consider the next possibilities:
     - There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. If she gives an extension, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - Conversely, there is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. In this case, we need to consider whether Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.

3. **Convincing the Teacher**:
   - If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a probability of 60%), there is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension.
   - Therefore, there is an 80% chance that he will not be able to convince her and will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the total probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework:

- **Case 1**: Substitute Teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of having to turn in homework = 0%

- **Case 2**: Normal Teacher (50% chance)
  - Probability of getting an extension from the teacher = 40% (thus, no homework)
  - Probability of not getting an extension = 60%
    - Within this, the probability of convincing the teacher = 20% (thus, no homework)
    - Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% (thus, must turn in homework)

Now we can calculate the probabilities for the normal teacher scenario:

- Probability of having to turn in homework with a normal teacher:
  \[
  P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher}) = P(\text{no extension}) \times P(\text{not convincing})
  \]
  \[
  = 0.60 \times 0.80 = 0.48
  \]

Now, we combine the probabilities from both cases:

- Total probability of having to turn in homework:
\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = P(\text{substitute}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | substitute}) + P(\text{normal teacher}) \times P(\text{turn in homework | normal teacher})
\]
\[
= 0.50 \times 0 + 0.50 \times 0.48
\]
\[
= 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

Finally, to express this as a percentage:
\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**. 

**Final Answer: 24%**
