To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that she starts with 3 puffs on Monday and sees double the number of clouds each subsequent day.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Monday**: 
   - Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   - Total for Monday = 3

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   - Number of clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6
   - Total for Tuesday = 6

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   - Number of clouds on Wednesday = 2 * 6 = 12
   - Total for Wednesday = 12

4. **Thursday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   - Number of clouds on Thursday = 2 * 12 = 24
   - Total for Thursday = 24

5. **Friday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   - Number of clouds on Friday = 2 * 24 = 48
   - Total for Friday = 48

Now, we will sum the total number of clouds counted over the five days:

\[
\text{Total clouds} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total clouds} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  3 + 6 = 9
  \]

- Next, add Wednesday:
  \[
  9 + 12 = 21
  \]

- Then, add Thursday:
  \[
  21 + 24 = 45
  \]

- Finally, add Friday:
  \[
  45 + 48 = 93
  \]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice counts from Monday to Friday is:

\[
\boxed{93}
\]
