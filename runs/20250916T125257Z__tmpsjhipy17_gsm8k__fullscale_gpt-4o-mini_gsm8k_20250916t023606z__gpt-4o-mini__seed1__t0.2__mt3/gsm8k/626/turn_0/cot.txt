To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the conversion factors**:
   - We know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb).
   - We also need to convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in one hour.

2. **Calculate the speed in megabits per second**:
   - Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s. To convert this to megabits per second, we use the conversion factor:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000}
     \]
   - Plugging in Ashley's speed:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

3. **Convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour**:
   - Since there are 3600 seconds in one hour, we multiply the speed in megabits per second by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times 3600
     \]
   - Substituting the value we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour (Mb/h)**.

In conclusion, Ashley's internet connection speed in megabits per hour is **72 Mb/h**.
