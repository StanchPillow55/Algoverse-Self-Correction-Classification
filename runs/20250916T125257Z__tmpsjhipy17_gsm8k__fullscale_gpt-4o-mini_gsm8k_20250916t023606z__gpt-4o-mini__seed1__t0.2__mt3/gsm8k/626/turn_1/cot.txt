To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Units**:
   - Ashley's speed is given as 20 kb/s.
   - We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb.
   - We need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

2. **Convert kb/s to Mb/s**:
   - To convert kilobits to megabits, we divide the number of kilobits by 1000.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

3. **Convert seconds to hours**:
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute Ã— 60 minutes per hour).
   - To find out how many megabits Ashley can download in one hour, we multiply her speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times \text{Number of seconds in an hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total megabits per hour**:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Ashley's internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour (Mb/h)**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{72 \text{ Mb/h}}
\]
