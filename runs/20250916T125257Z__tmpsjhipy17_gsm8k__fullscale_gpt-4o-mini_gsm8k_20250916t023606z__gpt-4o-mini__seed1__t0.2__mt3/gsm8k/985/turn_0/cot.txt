To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many.

**Step 1: Calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.**

Edgar's daily pretzel consumption is 18 pretzels. Since his brother eats half as many, we can calculate his brother's daily consumption as follows:

\[
\text{Brother's daily pretzel consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Edgar's daily pretzel consumption}
\]

Substituting in the value:

\[
\text{Brother's daily pretzel consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.**

Now that we know his brother eats 9 pretzels a day, we need to find out how many pretzels he eats in a week (7 days). We can do this by multiplying his daily consumption by the number of days in a week:

\[
\text{Brother's weekly pretzel consumption} = \text{Brother's daily pretzel consumption} \times 7
\]

Substituting in the value we found:

\[
\text{Brother's weekly pretzel consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ pretzels}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Edgar's brother eats **63 pretzels** in a week.
