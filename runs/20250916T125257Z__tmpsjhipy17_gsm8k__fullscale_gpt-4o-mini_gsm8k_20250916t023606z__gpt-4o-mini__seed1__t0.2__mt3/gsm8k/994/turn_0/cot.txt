To solve the problem, we need to calculate the duration of howls for each of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for a total of 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias. 
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we need to find the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     \text{Combined duration} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is:
     \[
     60 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Total Duration of Howls:**
   - Now we can find the total duration of all three howls:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} + \text{Igneous's howl}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Total duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

\[
\boxed{2} \text{ minutes}
\]
