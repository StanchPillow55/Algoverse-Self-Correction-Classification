To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Aliya's age**: We are given that Aliya is currently 3 years old.

2. **Determine Shawna's age**: The problem states that Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. 
   - Since Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Shawna's father's age**: The problem states that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
   - Now that we know Shawna is 9 years old, we can calculate her father's age:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

In conclusion, after going through the calculations step by step, we find that Shawna's father is **45 years old**.
