To calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday, we will break down her earnings for each day based on the information provided.

### Monday:
- **Classes Taught**: 4 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 5 hours

**Step 1: Calculate hourly earnings**
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, her earnings for the hours worked on Monday are:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Check for additional earnings**
Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes on Monday, she qualifies for the additional $5 per day:
\[
\text{Additional Earnings} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for Monday**
Now, we add her hourly earnings and additional earnings:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Monday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Additional Earnings} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Wednesday:
- **Classes Taught**: 2 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 2 hours

**Step 1: Calculate hourly earnings**
For Wednesday, her earnings for the hours worked are:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Check for additional earnings**
Since Tanya taught 2 classes on Wednesday, which is not more than 3 classes, she does not qualify for the additional $5:
\[
\text{Additional Earnings} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for Wednesday**
Now, we calculate her total earnings for Wednesday:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Additional Earnings} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Calculation:
Now we can find Tanya's total earnings for both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Earnings for Monday} + \text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for the two days of teaching.
