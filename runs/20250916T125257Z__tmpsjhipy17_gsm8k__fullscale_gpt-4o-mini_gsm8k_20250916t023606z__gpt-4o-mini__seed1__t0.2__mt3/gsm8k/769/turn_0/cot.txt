To find out how much Tanya earned for her teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we will calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings for Monday
On Monday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 4
- **Number of hours**: 5

**Earnings from hours taught**:
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, for 5 hours, her earnings from teaching hours are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes**:
Since Tanya taught 4 classes on Monday, which is more than 3, she earns an additional $5 for the day.

\[
\text{Additional earnings} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total earnings for Monday**:
Now, we add her earnings from hours and the additional earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings for Monday} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional earnings} = 75 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings for Wednesday
On Wednesday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 2
- **Number of hours**: 2

**Earnings from hours taught**:
For 2 hours, her earnings from teaching hours are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Rate per hour} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes**:
Since Tanya taught only 2 classes on Wednesday, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

\[
\text{Additional earnings} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total earnings for Wednesday**:
Now, we add her earnings from hours and the additional earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars} + 0 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days
Now, we sum the total earnings from both days:

\[
\text{Total earnings for both days} = \text{Total earnings for Monday} + \text{Total earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 30 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.
