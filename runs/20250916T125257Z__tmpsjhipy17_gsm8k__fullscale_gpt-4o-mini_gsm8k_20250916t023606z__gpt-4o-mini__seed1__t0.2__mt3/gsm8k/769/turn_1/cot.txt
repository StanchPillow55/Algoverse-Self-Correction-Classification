To calculate Tanya's earnings for Monday and Wednesday, we will break down her earnings for each day separately.

### Step 1: Calculate Monday's Earnings

**Classes Taught**: 4  
**Hours Worked**: 5  
**Hourly Rate**: $15  
**Additional Pay for Classes**: Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes, she earns an additional $5 for the day.

**Earnings from Hours Worked**:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Monday**:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional Pay} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Wednesday's Earnings

**Classes Taught**: 2  
**Hours Worked**: 2  
**Hourly Rate**: $15  
**Additional Pay for Classes**: Since Tanya taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not earn the additional $5.

**Earnings from Hours Worked**:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = \text{Hours Worked} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Wednesday**:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Additional Pay} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days

Now, we add the earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for Both Days} = \text{Total Earnings for Monday} + \text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.
