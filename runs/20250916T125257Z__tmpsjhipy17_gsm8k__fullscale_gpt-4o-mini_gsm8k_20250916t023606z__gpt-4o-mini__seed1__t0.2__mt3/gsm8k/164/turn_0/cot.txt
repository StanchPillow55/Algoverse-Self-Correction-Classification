To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and missed income for both options.

### Step 1: Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself.

Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work. The income she loses per hour is $35. Therefore, the total lost income can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Lost Income} = \text{Hours Missed} \times \text{Income per Hour}
\]
\[
\text{Lost Income} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of doing taxes herself.

If Jackie does her taxes herself, her total cost is simply the lost income, which we calculated in Step 1:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Doing Taxes Herself)} = \text{Lost Income} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant.

The accountant charges a flat fee of $90. Therefore, the total cost of hiring the accountant is:

\[
\text{Total Cost (Hiring Accountant)} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Compare the costs of both options.

Now we will compare the total costs of both options to see how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

1. **Cost of doing taxes herself**: $105
2. **Cost of hiring the accountant**: $90

### Step 5: Calculate the difference in costs.

To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing the taxes herself:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Doing Taxes Herself} - \text{Cost of Hiring Accountant}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.
