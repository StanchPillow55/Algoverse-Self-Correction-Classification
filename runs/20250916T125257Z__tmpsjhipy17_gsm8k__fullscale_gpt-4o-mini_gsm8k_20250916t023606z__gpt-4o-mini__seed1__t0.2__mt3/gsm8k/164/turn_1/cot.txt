To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and missed income for both scenarios.

1. **Calculating the missed income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - Her income from freelance work is $35 per hour.
   - Therefore, the total missed income is:
     \[
     \text{Missed Income} = \text{Hours Lost} \times \text{Income per Hour} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculating the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing her taxes herself is just the missed income, which we calculated as $105.

3. **Calculating the total cost if Jackie hires an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - Therefore, the total cost of hiring the accountant is $90.

4. **Comparing the two scenarios:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively "loses" $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.
   - To find out how much more money she has by hiring the accountant, we can compare the missed income with the accountant's fee:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Missed Income} - \text{Accountant's Fee} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Jackie will have } \$15 \text{ more if she hires the accountant.}
