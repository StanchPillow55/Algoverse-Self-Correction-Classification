To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to compare the costs and lost income associated with both options.

1. **Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will miss 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - Lost income = Hours missed Ã— Hourly rate
   \[
   \text{Lost income} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost of doing taxes herself is simply the lost income, which we calculated as $105.

3. **Calculate the cost of hiring an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.

4. **Compare the costs:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively "loses" $105.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

5. **Calculate the difference in money:**
   - To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the accountant's fee from the lost income:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Lost income} - \text{Accountant's fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 105 \text{ dollars} - 90 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself.

**Final Answer: Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**
