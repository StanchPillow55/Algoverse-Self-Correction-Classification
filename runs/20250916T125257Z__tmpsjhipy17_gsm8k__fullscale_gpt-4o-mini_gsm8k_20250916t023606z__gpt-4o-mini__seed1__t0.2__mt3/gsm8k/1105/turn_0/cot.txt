To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Lauren's annual retirement needs**: Since she plans to live on 40% of her current salary during retirement, we first need to find out what that amount is.

   \[
   \text{Annual retirement needs} = 0.40 \times \text{Current salary}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual retirement needs} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
   \]

   So, Lauren will need $40,000 per year during her retirement.

2. **Calculate total retirement savings needed for 20 years**: Next, we need to determine how much total savings she will need to cover her retirement period of 20 years.

   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = \text{Annual retirement needs} \times \text{Number of years in retirement}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total retirement savings needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
   \]

   Therefore, Lauren will need $800,000 in total savings for her retirement.

3. **Calculate how much Lauren saves each year**: Since Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck, we can calculate her annual savings.

   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \text{Current salary}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
   \]

   Lauren saves $20,000 each year.

4. **Determine how many years it will take to save $800,000**: To find out how many years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount, we divide the total savings needed by her annual savings.

   \[
   \text{Years needed to save} = \frac{\text{Total retirement savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Years needed to save} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
   \]

   Thus, Lauren needs to work for 40 years to save $800,000.

5. **Conclusion**: If Lauren is currently working and we assume she has already been working for a certain number of years, we need to know how many years she has already worked to determine how many more years she needs to work. However, since the problem does not specify how many years she has already worked, we will conclude that she needs to work a total of 40 years.

If we assume she has not worked any years yet, then she needs to work 40 more years. If she has worked some years, we would subtract those from 40 to find the remaining years.

**Final Answer**: Lauren needs to work a total of 40 years to save enough for retirement. If she has not worked any years yet, she needs to work 40 more years.
