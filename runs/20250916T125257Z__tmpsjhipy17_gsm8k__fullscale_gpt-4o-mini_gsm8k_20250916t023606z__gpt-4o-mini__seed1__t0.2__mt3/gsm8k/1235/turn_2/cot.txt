To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled in 3 days.

1. **Calculate the number of hours in 3 days:**
   \[
   \text{Number of hours in 3 days} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Average speed} \times \text{Total time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered.

1. **Identify the total distance between Alaska and Texas:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage of the distance covered:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage covered} = \left( 0.6 \right) \times 100 = 60\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
