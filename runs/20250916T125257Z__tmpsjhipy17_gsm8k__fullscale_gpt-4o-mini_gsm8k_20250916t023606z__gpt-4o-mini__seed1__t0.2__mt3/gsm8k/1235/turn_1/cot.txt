To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Michael travels in 3 days.**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - We need to find out how many hours he travels in 3 days. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total hours in 3 days} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance traveled.**
   - Using the formula for distance, which is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - We can substitute in Michael's speed and the total time:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
     \]

3. **Determine the percentage of the total distance covered.**
   - The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km. To find the percentage of the distance Michael has covered, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage.**
   - First, we simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \frac{3600}{6000} = 0.6
     \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
