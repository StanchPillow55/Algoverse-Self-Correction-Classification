To determine the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we first need to calculate the total distance he travels in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.

### Step 1: Calculate the total travel time in hours
Michael travels for 3 days. To convert days into hours:
\[
\text{Total hours} = 3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled
Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
\text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the total distance covered
The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km. We need to find out what percentage of this distance 3600 km represents. The formula for percentage is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
In this case, the "Part" is the distance Michael has traveled (3600 km), and the "Whole" is the total distance (6000 km):
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600 \text{ km}}{6000 \text{ km}} \right) \times 100
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
Calculating the fraction:
\[
\frac{3600}{6000} = 0.6
\]
Now, converting this to a percentage:
\[
0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
\]

### Final Answer
Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
