To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of all the toys in the room. We have the following information:

1. There are:
   - 5 red cars
   - 3 action figures
   - 1 doll

2. The cost of one red car is $4.

3. The cost of one action figure is $5.

4. The cost of the doll is equal to the cost of 3 action figures.

Now, let's break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the red cars
The cost of one red car is $4. Therefore, the total cost for 5 red cars is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of red cars} = \text{Number of red cars} \times \text{Cost per red car}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the action figures
The cost of one action figure is $5. Therefore, the total cost for 3 action figures is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of action figures} = \text{Number of action figures} \times \text{Cost per action figure}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the doll
The cost of the doll is equal to the cost of 3 action figures. Since we already calculated the cost of 3 action figures to be $15, the cost of the doll is:

\[
\text{Cost of the doll} = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all toys
Now, we can find the total cost of all the toys by adding the costs of the red cars, action figures, and the doll together:

\[
\text{Total cost of all toys} = \text{Total cost of red cars} + \text{Total cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of the doll}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of all toys} = 20 + 15 + 15
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of all toys} = 50
\]

### Final Answer
The total worth of all the toys is **$50**.
