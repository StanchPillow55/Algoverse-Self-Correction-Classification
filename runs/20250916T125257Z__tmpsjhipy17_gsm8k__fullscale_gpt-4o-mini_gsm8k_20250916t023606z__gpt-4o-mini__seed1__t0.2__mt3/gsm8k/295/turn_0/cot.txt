To find the total count of activities Darren has done over the two days, we will break down the exercises he performed each day and then sum them up.

### Day 1:
- **Pushups**: 100
- **Squats**: 50
- **Dumbbell presses**: 20

Now, let's calculate the total number of exercises he did on the first day:

\[
\text{Total Day 1} = \text{Pushups} + \text{Squats} + \text{Dumbbell presses}
\]
\[
\text{Total Day 1} = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
\]

### Day 2:
On the second day, Darren's counts change as follows:
- **Pushups**: He does 20 more pushups than on the first day.
- **Squats**: He does 10 fewer squats than on the first day.
- **Dumbbell presses**: He doubles the number of dumbbell presses from the first day.

Now, let's calculate the counts for the second day:

1. **Pushups**:
   \[
   \text{Pushups Day 2} = \text{Pushups Day 1} + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120
   \]

2. **Squats**:
   \[
   \text{Squats Day 2} = \text{Squats Day 1} - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Dumbbell presses**:
   \[
   \text{Dumbbell presses Day 2} = 2 \times \text{Dumbbell presses Day 1} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of exercises he did on the second day:

\[
\text{Total Day 2} = \text{Pushups Day 2} + \text{Squats Day 2} + \text{Dumbbell presses Day 2}
\]
\[
\text{Total Day 2} = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200
\]

### Total for Both Days:
Now, we will add the totals from both days to find the overall total:

\[
\text{Total for Both Days} = \text{Total Day 1} + \text{Total Day 2}
\]
\[
\text{Total for Both Days} = 170 + 200 = 370
\]

### Final Answer:
The total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is \( \boxed{370} \).
