To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the ride bracelet for David
David buys a ride bracelet that allows him to ride all 9 rides for a flat fee of $30.

\[
\text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of tickets for Dasha
Dasha buys individual ride tickets. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets, and each ticket costs $2.

First, we need to calculate the total number of tickets Dasha needs for 9 rides:

\[
\text{Total tickets needed} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets per ride} = 18 \text{ tickets}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for Dasha to buy 18 tickets:

\[
\text{Cost per ticket} = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Dasha} = 18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars per ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how much David saves
Now, we can find out how much money David saves by comparing the costs:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets like Dasha.
