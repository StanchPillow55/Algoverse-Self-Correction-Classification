To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet compared to Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet for David:**
   - The cost of the ride bracelet is $30.
   - Since the bracelet allows David to ride all 9 rides, he pays a flat fee of $30.

2. **Cost of individual ride tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - The cost of each ticket is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride in terms of tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for one ride} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 9 rides} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings for David:**
   - Now we compare the total costs:
     - David's cost (with the bracelet) = $30
     - Dasha's cost (with tickets) = $36
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Dasha's cost} - \text{David's cost} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the amount of money that David saves by buying the ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual tickets is **$6**.

Final answer: **$6**
