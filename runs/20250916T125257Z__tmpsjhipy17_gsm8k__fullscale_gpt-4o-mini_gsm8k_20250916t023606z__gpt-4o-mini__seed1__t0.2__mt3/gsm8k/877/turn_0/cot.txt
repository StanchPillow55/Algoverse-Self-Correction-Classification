To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Isaias spent on the chickens he plans to sell at the market.

### Step 1: Determine the number of chickens Isaias plans to sell.

Isaias has a total of 300 chickens and plans to sell \( \frac{3}{5} \) of them.

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Number of chickens to sell} = \frac{3 \times 300}{5} = \frac{900}{5} = 180
\]

So, Isaias plans to sell 180 chickens.

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the chickens.

Isaias sells each chicken for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 180 chickens is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of chickens sold} \times \text{Price per chicken}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
\]

### Step 3: Determine the profit and cost.

Isaias wants to make a profit of $2000. The profit is calculated as:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]

Rearranging this gives us:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Profit}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per chicken.

Now that we know the total cost for the 180 chickens, we can find out how much Isaias spent on each chicken he took to the market.

\[
\text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of chickens sold}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Cost per chicken} = \frac{7000}{180}
\]

Calculating the division:

\[
\text{Cost per chicken} \approx 38.89
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for approximately **$38.89** each. 

To summarize, Isaias bought the chickens for a total cost of $7000, which means he spent about $38.89 per chicken.
