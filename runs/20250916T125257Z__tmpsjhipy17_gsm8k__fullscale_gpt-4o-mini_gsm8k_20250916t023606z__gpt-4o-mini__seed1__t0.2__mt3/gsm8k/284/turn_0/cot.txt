To find the total number of stories that Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote altogether over the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of stories each child wrote in the first week.**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

2. **Calculate the number of stories each child wrote in the second week.**
   - Since each child doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week, we will multiply the number of stories they wrote in the first week by 2.
   - Alani's second week stories: \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \)
   - Braylen's second week stories: \( 40 \times 2 = 80 \)
   - Margot's second week stories: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \)

3. **Calculate the total number of stories written by each child over the two weeks.**
   - Total stories for Alani: \( 20 + 40 = 60 \)
   - Total stories for Braylen: \( 40 + 80 = 120 \)
   - Total stories for Margot: \( 60 + 120 = 180 \)

4. **Calculate the overall total number of stories written by all three children.**
   - Total stories: \( 60 + 120 + 180 \)

Now, let's perform the final addition:
\[
60 + 120 = 180
\]
\[
180 + 180 = 360
\]

Thus, the total number of stories written altogether by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks is **360**.

**Final Answer: 360**
