To determine how much money Susan earns for her online task, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total working time**: 
   - Susan works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. This is a total of 3 hours.
   - However, she takes a half-hour break during this time.
   - Therefore, the actual working time is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} - 0.5 \text{ hours} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Convert working time into minutes**:
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 2.5 hours into minutes:
     \[
     2.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes**:
   - Since Susan earns $5 every 10 minutes, we need to find out how many 10-minute intervals fit into 150 minutes:
     \[
     \frac{150 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 15 \text{ intervals}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings**:
   - Now, we multiply the number of intervals by the amount she earns per interval:
     \[
     15 \text{ intervals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/interval} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Susan earns for her online task is:

\[
\boxed{75 \text{ dollars}}
\]
