To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.**
2. **Determine how many potted plants she will give away.**
3. **Calculate how many potted plants she will have left after giving some away.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.

Mary has 40 window ledges, and on each ledge, she has 2 potted plants. Therefore, the total number of potted plants on the window ledges is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total plants on ledges} = \text{Number of ledges} \times \text{Plants per ledge} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

Now, we add the 18 new potted plants she received:

\[
\text{Total plants} = \text{Total plants on ledges} + \text{New plants} = 80 + 18 = 98
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many potted plants she will give away.

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[
\text{Plants given away} = \text{Number of ledges} = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many potted plants she will have left after giving some away.

Now, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number of plants she has:

\[
\text{Plants remaining} = \text{Total plants} - \text{Plants given away} = 98 - 40 = 58
\]

### Final Answer

After giving away the plants, Mary will have **58 potted plants** remaining.
