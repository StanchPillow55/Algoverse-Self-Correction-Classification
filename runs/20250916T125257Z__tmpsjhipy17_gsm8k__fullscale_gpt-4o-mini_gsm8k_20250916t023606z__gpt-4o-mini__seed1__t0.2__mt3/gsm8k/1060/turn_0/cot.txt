To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many slices each person ate based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the total number of slices:**
   Each pizza has 8 slices, and there are 4 pizzas. Therefore, the total number of slices is:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 4 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices/pizza} = 32 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Information about the slices eaten:**
   - Becky ate 10 slices.
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.
   - Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.

3. **Setting up the equations:**
   Let \( J \) represent the number of slices Jake ate. According to the problem:
   - Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, so:
     \[
     B = J + 3
     \]
   - We know from the problem that Becky ate 10 slices, so:
     \[
     10 = J + 3
     \]
   - To find \( J \), we can rearrange this equation:
     \[
     J = 10 - 3 = 7
     \]
   - Therefore, Jake ate 7 slices.

4. **Calculating Silvia's slices:**
   Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake:
   \[
   S = 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14
   \]
   So, Silvia ate 14 slices.

5. **Calculating the total slices eaten:**
   Now we can find the total number of slices eaten by Becky, Jake, and Silvia:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = B + J + S = 10 + 7 + 14
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   10 + 7 = 17
   \]
   \[
   17 + 14 = 31
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   The total number of slices they ate is:
   \[
   \boxed{31}
   \]
