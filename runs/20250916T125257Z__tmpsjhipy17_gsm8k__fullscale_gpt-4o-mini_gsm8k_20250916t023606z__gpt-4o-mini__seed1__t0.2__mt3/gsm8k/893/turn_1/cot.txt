To find out how much Mark makes in a week after his pay raise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Mark's new hourly wage**:
   - Mark's original hourly wage was $10.
   - His pay was raised by $2.
   - New hourly wage = Original wage + Raise = $10 + $2 = $12.

2. **Calculate the total hours Mark works in a week**:
   - Mark works 8 hours a day for 5 days a week.
   - Total hours worked in a week = Hours per day × Days per week = 8 hours/day × 5 days/week = 40 hours/week.

3. **Calculate Mark's weekly earnings**:
   - Weekly earnings = Hourly wage × Total hours worked in a week.
   - Weekly earnings = $12/hour × 40 hours/week = $480.

Thus, Mark makes **$480 a week** after his pay raise. 

Final answer: **$480**.
