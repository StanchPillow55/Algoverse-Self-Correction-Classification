To determine how many toys James needs for his doggie shelter, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog currently has one toy.
   - Total dogs initially = 4.

2. **Additional Dogs**:
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total dogs after adding the new ones = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 dogs.

3. **Toys Needed for 12 Dogs**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

4. **Toys James Needs to Buy**:
   - James currently has 4 toys and needs 12 toys.
   - Toys to buy = 12 (needed) - 4 (on hand) = 8 toys.

5. **Situation After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, so now he has 12 toys (4 on hand + 8 bought).

6. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - After buying the toys, he finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Initially, there were 4 dogs, and he added 8 more, making it 12.
   - "Twice as many more dogs" means he needs to consider the number of dogs that were added (8) and double that.
   - Additional dogs = 8 (current additional) * 2 = 16 more dogs.
   - Total dogs now = 12 (current) + 16 (new) = 28 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed for 28 Dogs**:
   - James now needs 28 toys for 28 dogs.

8. **Toys James Needs to Buy Again**:
   - He has 12 toys now.
   - Toys to buy = 28 (needed) - 12 (on hand) = 16 toys.

9. **Situation After Some Dogs Leave**:
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total dogs now = 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

10. **Toys Needed for 25 Dogs**:
    - Now, James needs 25 toys for 25 dogs.

11. **Final Calculation of Toys Needed**:
    - He has 12 toys (after the first purchase) and then bought 16 more, so he has:
      - Total toys = 12 + 16 = 28 toys.
    - Since he now only needs 25 toys, he does not need to buy any more toys.

12. **Final Answer**:
    - James needs a total of 25 toys for the current number of dogs in the shelter.

Thus, the final answer is:
**James needs 25 toys in total.**
