To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes **20 minutes** to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes **40% longer** than the time taken to heat to 300 degrees.
   - First, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - The total time taken to heat the oil from the start to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Cooking time:**
   - After warming the oil, it takes **5 minutes less time to cook** than it took to warm up the oil.
   - The time taken to warm up the oil is 48 minutes, so the cooking time is:
     \[
     48 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 43 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - We add the total heating time and the cooking time:
     \[
     48 \text{ minutes} + 43 \text{ minutes} = 91 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:

\[
\boxed{91} \text{ minutes}
\]
