To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after applying the 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original total cost of the shirts**:
   - Each shirt costs $30.
   - Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we can calculate the total cost before the discount:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per shirt} \times \text{Number of shirts} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of the discount**:
   - The discount is 40% of the total cost. To find the discount amount, we first convert the percentage into a decimal:
     \[
     40\% = 0.40
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the discount amount:
     \[
     \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Discount rate} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the final price after applying the discount**:
   - To find out how much Davos actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the original total cost:
     \[
     \text{Final price} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts after the discount is:
     \[
     \boxed{36} \text{ dollars}
     \]
