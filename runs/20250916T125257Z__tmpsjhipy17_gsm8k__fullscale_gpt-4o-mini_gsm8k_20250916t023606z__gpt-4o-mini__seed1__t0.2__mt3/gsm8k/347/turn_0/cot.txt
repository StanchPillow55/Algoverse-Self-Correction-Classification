To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after applying the 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original total cost of the shirts**:
   - Each shirt costs $30.
   - Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we multiply the cost of one shirt by the number of shirts:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before discount} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount**:
   - The discount is 40% of the total cost before the discount. To find the discount amount, we first convert the percentage to a decimal:
     \[
     40\% = 0.40
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the discount amount by multiplying the total cost by the discount rate:
     \[
     \text{Discount amount} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the final price after applying the discount**:
   - To find out how much Davos actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:
     \[
     \text{Final price} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Discount amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Final price} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts after the 40% discount is **$36**.

Final answer: **$36**
