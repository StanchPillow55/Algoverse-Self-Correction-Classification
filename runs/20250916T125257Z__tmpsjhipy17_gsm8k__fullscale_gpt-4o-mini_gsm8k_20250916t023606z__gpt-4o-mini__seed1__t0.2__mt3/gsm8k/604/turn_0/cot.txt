To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating how much Howard spends each day and then determining how much money he has left after these expenditures.

1. **Calculate Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Monday = $8.

2. **Calculate Tuesday's Spending:**
   - On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Tuesday = 2 × Amount spent on Monday = 2 × $8 = $16.

3. **Calculate Wednesday's Spending:**
   - On Wednesday, Howard spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.
   - Amount spent on Wednesday = 4 × Amount spent on Tuesday = 4 × $16 = $64.

4. **Calculate Total Spending:**
   - Now, we will find the total amount Howard spent over the three days.
   - Total spending = Amount spent on Monday + Amount spent on Tuesday + Amount spent on Wednesday
   - Total spending = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

5. **Calculate Remaining Money:**
   - Howard originally had $100.
   - To find out how much money he has left after his spending, we subtract his total spending from his original amount.
   - Remaining money = Original amount - Total spending
   - Remaining money = $100 - $88 = $12.

Thus, after spending money at the arcade over the three days, Howard has $12 left.

**Final Answer: Howard has $12 left.**
