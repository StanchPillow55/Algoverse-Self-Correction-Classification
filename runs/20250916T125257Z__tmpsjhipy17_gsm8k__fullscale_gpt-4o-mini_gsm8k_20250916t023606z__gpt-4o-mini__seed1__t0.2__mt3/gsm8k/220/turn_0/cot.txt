To determine how much time Carmen spent solving crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we need to calculate the total time spent on each type of puzzle separately and then sum those times.

1. **Calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:**
   - Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
   - She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for crossword puzzles} = \text{Number of crossword puzzles} \times \text{Time per crossword puzzle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for crossword puzzles} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:**
   - Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
   - She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for sudoku puzzles} = \text{Number of sudoku puzzles} \times \text{Time per sudoku puzzle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for sudoku puzzles} = 8 \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on both types of puzzles:**
   - Now, we will add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time for crossword puzzles} + \text{Time for sudoku puzzles}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games over the weekend is **70 minutes**.

Final answer: **70 minutes**.
