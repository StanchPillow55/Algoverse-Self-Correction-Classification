To solve the problem, we will first calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon and then determine James's total time based on the information given.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time

1. **Swim Time**: 40 minutes
2. **Bike Time**: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. **Run Time**: 50 minutes

Now, we add these times together to find Jon's total time:

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = \text{Swim Time} + \text{Bike Time} + \text{Run Time}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Total Time

1. **Swim Time**: James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first calculate 10% of Jon's swim time:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ minutes} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since James is faster, we subtract this from Jon's swim time:

\[
\text{James's Swim Time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

2. **Bike Time**: James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:

\[
\text{James's Bike Time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

3. **Run Time**: Let \( r \) be the time it takes James to run. We will find \( r \) later.

### Step 3: Calculate James's Total Time

Now we can express James's total time as:

\[
\text{Total Time for James} = \text{James's Swim Time} + \text{James's Bike Time} + \text{James's Run Time}
\]
\[
\text{Total Time for James} = 36 + 85 + r = 121 + r \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Compare Times

According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes. This means:

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = \text{Total Time for James} + 10
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
170 = (121 + r) + 10
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( r \)

Now we simplify the equation:

\[
170 = 131 + r
\]

Subtract 131 from both sides:

\[
r = 170 - 131 = 39 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:

\[
\boxed{39 \text{ minutes}}
\]
