To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon, and then determine how long James took to run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time
Jon's times for each segment of the triathlon are as follows:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes (which is 80 minutes)
- Run: 50 minutes

Now, we can calculate Jon's total time:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = \text{Swim} + \text{Bike} + \text{Run}
\]
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time
James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find out how long it takes James to swim, we first need to determine what 10% faster means in terms of time.

If Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, then 10% of that time is:
\[
10\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.1 \times 40 = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]
Since James is faster, he takes 4 minutes less than Jon:
\[
\text{James's swim time} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Since Jon's bike time is 80 minutes, we calculate James's bike time as follows:
\[
\text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time Without the Run
Now we can calculate James's total time for the swim and bike:
\[
\text{Total time for James (swim + bike)} = \text{James's swim time} + \text{James's bike time}
\]
\[
\text{Total time for James (swim + bike)} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Determine Jon's Winning Time
According to the problem, Jon won by 10 minutes. This means that James's total time for the triathlon is:
\[
\text{James's total time} = \text{Jon's total time} + 10
\]
\[
\text{James's total time} = 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate James's Run Time
Now we can find out how long James took to run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:
\[
\text{James's run time} = \text{James's total time} - \text{Total time for James (swim + bike)}
\]
\[
\text{James's run time} = 180 - 121 = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the time it took James to do the run is:
\[
\boxed{59 \text{ minutes}}
\]
