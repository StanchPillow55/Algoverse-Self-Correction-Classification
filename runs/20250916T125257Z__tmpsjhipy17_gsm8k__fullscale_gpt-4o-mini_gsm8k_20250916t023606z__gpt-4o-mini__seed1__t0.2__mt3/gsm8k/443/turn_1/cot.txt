To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon and then determine how long James took for the run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time
- **Swim:** 40 minutes
- **Bike:** 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- **Run:** 50 minutes

Now, we add these times together to find Jon's total time:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time
James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first need to determine how long it would take Jon to swim 100% of the distance. If Jon takes 40 minutes, then James's time can be calculated as follows:

- **10% faster means:** James's time = Jon's time × (1 - 0.10) = Jon's time × 0.90
\[
\text{James's swim time} = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time
James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike:
\[
\text{James's bike time} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time
Let \( R \) be the time it takes James to run. Then, James's total time is:
\[
\text{Total time for James} = \text{James's swim time} + \text{James's bike time} + R
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Total time for James} = 36 + 85 + R = 121 + R \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation
We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, which means:
\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = \text{Total time for James} + 10
\]
Substituting the total times:
\[
170 = (121 + R) + 10
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
170 = 131 + R
\]
Now, we solve for \( R \):
\[
R = 170 - 131 = 39 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
James took **39 minutes** to do the run.
