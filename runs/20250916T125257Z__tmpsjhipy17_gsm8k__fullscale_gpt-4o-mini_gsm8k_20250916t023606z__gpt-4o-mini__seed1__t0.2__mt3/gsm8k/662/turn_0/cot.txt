To find out how much the apple pie cost, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, and then subtract that from the total amount he spent at the grocery store.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   Gus bought 2 bags of chips for $2.00 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of chips} = 2 \text{ bags} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/bag} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the fried chicken:**
   Gus bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of fried chicken} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the soda:**
   Gus bought a bottle of soda for $1.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soda} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the items Gus bought:**
   Now we add the costs of all the items:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = \text{Cost of chips} + \text{Cost of fried chicken} + \text{Cost of soda}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much was spent on the apple pie:**
   Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Total cost of items}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is \(\boxed{7.00}\) dollars.
