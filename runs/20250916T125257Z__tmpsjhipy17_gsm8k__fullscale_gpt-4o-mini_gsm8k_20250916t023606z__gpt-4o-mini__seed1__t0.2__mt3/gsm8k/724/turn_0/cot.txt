To solve the problem, we will first determine how many pizzas were ordered in total, how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and finally how many slices are left.

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered**:
   Bryce and four of his friends means there are 5 people in total. Each person ordered one pizza.
   \[
   \text{Total pizzas} = 5
   \]

2. **Total number of slices**:
   Each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from all pizzas is:
   \[
   \text{Total slices} = \text{Total pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   Bryce and two of his friends (3 people) ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. The number of pizzas they ordered is:
   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3
   \]
   The total slices they ate is:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total slices from 3 pizzas} = \frac{2}{3} \times (3 \times 12) = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**:
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. The number of pizzas they ordered is:
   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by remaining friends} = 2
   \]
   The total slices they ate is:
   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total slices from 2 pizzas} = \frac{3}{4} \times (2 \times 12) = \frac{3}{4} \times 24 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total slices eaten**:
   Now we can find the total slices eaten by both groups:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Slices eaten by Bryce and friends} + \text{Slices eaten by remaining friends} = 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices left**:
   Finally, we can find the number of slices left by subtracting the total slices eaten from the total slices:
   \[
   \text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Total slices eaten} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
