To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pizzas ordered:**
   Bryce and his four friends ordered their own pizzas, which means there are a total of:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Bryce)} + 4 \text{ (friends)} = 5 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of slices:**
   Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices from all pizzas is:
   \[
   5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Determine how many slices were eaten by Bryce and two friends:**
   Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in total (Bryce and two friends), we need to calculate how many slices they ate:
   - Each person has 1 pizza, so they collectively have:
   \[
   3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 36 \text{ slices}
   \]
   - They ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of these 36 slices:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ slices} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Determine how many slices were eaten by the two remaining friends:**
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Each of these friends also has 1 pizza, so together they have:
   \[
   2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]
   - They ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of these 24 slices:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 24 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten:**
   Now, we add the slices eaten by both groups:
   \[
   24 \text{ slices (Bryce and two friends)} + 18 \text{ slices (two remaining friends)} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Determine how many slices are left:**
   Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[
   60 \text{ slices (total)} - 42 \text{ slices (eaten)} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices of pizza left is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
