To solve the problem, we will first determine how many slices of pizza were ordered in total, then calculate how many slices were eaten, and finally find out how many slices are left.

1. **Total number of pizzas ordered**:
   Bryce and his four friends ordered a total of 5 pizzas (1 for each person).

   \[
   \text{Total pizzas} = 5
   \]

2. **Total number of slices**:
   Each pizza has 12 slices, so the total number of slices is:

   \[
   \text{Total slices} = 5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices eaten by Bryce and two friends**:
   Bryce and two friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pizzas they consumed is:

   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

   The total slices they ate is:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = 3 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{2}{3} = 3 \times 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 24 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Slices eaten by the two remaining friends**:
   The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. They each had 1 pizza, so together they had:

   \[
   \text{Pizzas eaten by remaining friends} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

   The total slices they ate is:

   \[
   \text{Slices eaten} = 2 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices/pizza} \times \frac{3}{4} = 2 \times 12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Total slices eaten**:
   Now we add the slices eaten by both groups:

   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten} = 24 \text{ slices} + 18 \text{ slices} = 42 \text{ slices}
   \]

6. **Slices left**:
   Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten from the total slices ordered:

   \[
   \text{Slices left} = 60 \text{ slices} - 42 \text{ slices} = 18 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\] 

There are 18 slices of pizza left.
