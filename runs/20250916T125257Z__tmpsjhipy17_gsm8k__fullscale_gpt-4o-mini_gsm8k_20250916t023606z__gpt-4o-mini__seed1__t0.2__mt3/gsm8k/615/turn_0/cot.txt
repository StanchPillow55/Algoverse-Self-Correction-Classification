To find out how much Scarlett spent in total, we will break down her purchases step by step and calculate the total cost for each item.

1. **Cost of the aquarium**:
   - Scarlett bought the aquarium for **$10.00**.

2. **Cost of the rocks**:
   - She bought **2 bags of rocks** for **$2.50 each**.
   - Total cost for the rocks = Number of bags × Cost per bag
   \[
   \text{Total cost for rocks} = 2 \times 2.50 = 5.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the coral**:
   - She bought **3 pieces of coral** at **$2.00 each**.
   - Total cost for the coral = Number of pieces × Cost per piece
   \[
   \text{Total cost for coral} = 3 \times 2.00 = 6.00
   \]

4. **Cost of the fish**:
   - She bought **20 fish** at **$0.50 each**.
   - Total cost for the fish = Number of fish × Cost per fish
   \[
   \text{Total cost for fish} = 20 \times 0.50 = 10.00
   \]

5. **Cost of the fish food**:
   - The fish food cost **$2.00**.

Now, we will add all these costs together to find the total amount spent by Scarlett.

- Total cost = Cost of aquarium + Cost of rocks + Cost of coral + Cost of fish + Cost of fish food
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 10.00 + 2.00
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
- First, add the cost of the aquarium and the rocks:
\[
10.00 + 5.00 = 15.00
\]
- Next, add the cost of the coral:
\[
15.00 + 6.00 = 21.00
\]
- Then, add the cost of the fish:
\[
21.00 + 10.00 = 31.00
\]
- Finally, add the cost of the fish food:
\[
31.00 + 2.00 = 33.00
\]

Thus, the total amount Scarlett spent is **$33.00**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{33.00}
\]
