To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the Loan Amount
John's house is worth $250,000. He decides to take a loan that is worth 40% of the value of his house.

To find 40% of $250,000, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = \text{House Value} \times \text{Percentage}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Amount Used to Pay Off Debts
John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We need to calculate 60% of the loan amount ($100,000).

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Percentage}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Amount Leftover After Paying Debts
To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used for debts from the total loan amount.

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Amount Used for Debts}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Amount Leftover} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

### Final Answer
John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40,000}
\]
