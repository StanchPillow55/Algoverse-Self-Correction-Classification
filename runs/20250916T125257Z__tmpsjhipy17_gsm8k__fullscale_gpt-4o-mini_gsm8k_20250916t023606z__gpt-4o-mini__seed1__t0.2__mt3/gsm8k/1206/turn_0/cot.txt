To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the loan John receives.**
2. **Determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts.**
3. **Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of the loan

John's house is worth $250,000, and he gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 40\% \text{ of } 250,000
\]

To calculate 40% of $250,000, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
40\% = 0.40
\]

Now we multiply:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

So, John receives a loan of **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Determine how much of the loan he uses to pay off his debts

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 60\% \text{ of } 100,000
\]

Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
60\% = 0.60
\]

Now we multiply:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts

To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the debt payment from the total loan amount:

\[
\text{Money Left} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Money Left} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, after paying off his debts, John has **$40,000** left.

### Final Answer

John has **$40,000** leftover after paying off his debts.
