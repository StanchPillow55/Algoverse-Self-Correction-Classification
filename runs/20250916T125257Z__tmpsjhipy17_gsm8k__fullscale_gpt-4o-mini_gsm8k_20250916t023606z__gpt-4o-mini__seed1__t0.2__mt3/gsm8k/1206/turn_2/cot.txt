To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of the loan
John's house is worth $250,000. He decides to get a loan worth 40% of that value.

To find 40% of $250,000, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = \text{House Value} \times \text{Percentage}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40 = 100,000
\]

So, John gets a loan of **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Calculate the amount used to pay off debts
John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts. We need to find 60% of the loan amount ($100,000).

Using the same formula:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Percentage}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 100,000 \times 0.60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 100,000 \times 0.60 = 60,000
\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate the leftover amount after paying debts
To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

### Final Answer
John has **$40,000** leftover after paying off his debts.
