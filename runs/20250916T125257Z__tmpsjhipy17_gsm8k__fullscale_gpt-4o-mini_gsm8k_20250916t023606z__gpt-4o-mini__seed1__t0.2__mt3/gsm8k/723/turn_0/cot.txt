To determine how many chairs the restaurant has left after sending some for repair, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of chairs**:
   - Normal chairs: 170
   - Baby chairs: 23

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs before any repairs**:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs} = \text{Normal chairs} + \text{Baby chairs} = 170 + 23 = 193
   \]

3. **Identify the number of chairs sent for repair**:
   - Normal chairs sent for repair: 20
   - Baby chairs sent for repair: 13

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs sent for repair**:
   \[
   \text{Total chairs sent for repair} = \text{Normal chairs sent} + \text{Baby chairs sent} = 20 + 13 = 33
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of chairs left after repairs**:
   \[
   \text{Chairs left} = \text{Total chairs} - \text{Total chairs sent for repair} = 193 - 33 = 160
   \]

Thus, the restaurant has **160 chairs left** after sending some for repair.

Final answer: **160 chairs**.
