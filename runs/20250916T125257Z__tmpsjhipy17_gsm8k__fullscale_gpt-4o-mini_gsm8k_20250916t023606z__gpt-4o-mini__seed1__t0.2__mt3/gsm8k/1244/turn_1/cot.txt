To determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on her second test to pass to 7th grade, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests:**
   - First test: 70 questions
   - Second test: 40 questions
   - Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. **Determine the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass:**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - 70% of 110 questions = 0.70 × 110 = 77 questions

3. **Calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test:**
   - She answered 60% of the first test correctly.
   - Correct answers on the first test = 60% of 70 = 0.60 × 70 = 42 questions

4. **Determine how many more questions she needs to answer correctly on the second test:**
   - Total correct answers needed = 77 questions
   - Correct answers from the first test = 42 questions
   - Questions needed from the second test = 77 - 42 = 35 questions

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Audrey needs to answer **35 questions correctly** on the second test to pass to 7th grade.

Final answer: **35 questions**.
