To determine how much fabric Luke needs to buy for the curtains, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width of the windows**: 
   - Each window is 35 inches wide.
   - There are 5 windows.
   - Total width of the windows = Number of windows × Width of each window
   \[
   \text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches} = 175 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of fabric needed**:
   - Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.
   - Therefore, the amount of fabric needed = 2 × Total width
   \[
   \text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 \text{ inches} = 350 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, Luke should buy **350 inches** of fabric for the curtains. 

Final answer: **350 inches**.
