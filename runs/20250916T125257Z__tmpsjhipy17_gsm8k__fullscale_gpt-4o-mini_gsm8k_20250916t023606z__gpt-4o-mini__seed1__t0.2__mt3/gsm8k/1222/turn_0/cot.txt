To determine how much fabric Luke should buy for the curtains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width of the windows**: 
   Luke has five windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. To find the total width of all the windows, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window.

   \[
   \text{Total width of windows} = \text{Number of windows} \times \text{Width of each window}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total width of windows} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total width of windows} = 175 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of fabric needed**: 
   Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. Therefore, we multiply the total width by 2.

   \[
   \text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times \text{Total width of windows}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   Luke should buy a total of 350 inches of fabric for the curtains.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.**
