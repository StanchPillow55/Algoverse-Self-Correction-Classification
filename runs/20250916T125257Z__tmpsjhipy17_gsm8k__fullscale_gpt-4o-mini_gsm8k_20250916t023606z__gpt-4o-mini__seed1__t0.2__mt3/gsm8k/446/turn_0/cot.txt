To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has.**
2. **Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made with the total number of eggs.**
3. **Calculate how many trays can be filled based on the number of glasses.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs

Rozanne uses:
- 4 dozen eggs
- 2 loose eggs

First, we need to convert the dozen into individual eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:

\[
4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

Now, we add the 2 loose eggs:

\[
\text{Total eggs} = 48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses can be made with 50 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed for each glass:

\[
\text{Number of glasses} = \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many trays can be filled

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

### Final Answer

Rozanne can put out **2 trays** of eggnog.
