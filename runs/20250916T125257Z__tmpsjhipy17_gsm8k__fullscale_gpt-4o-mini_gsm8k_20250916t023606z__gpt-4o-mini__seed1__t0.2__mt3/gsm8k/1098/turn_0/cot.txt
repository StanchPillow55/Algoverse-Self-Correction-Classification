To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, using the information provided about the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike.

1. **Identify Mike's Age**: 
   - We know from the problem that Mike is 24 years old.

2. **Determine Martha's Age**:
   - The problem states that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
     \]
   - So, Martha is 20 years old.

3. **Determine Jeff's Age**:
   - The problem also states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.
   - We can calculate Jeff's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - Thus, Jeff is 30 years old.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - After calculating the ages step by step, we find that Jeff is 30 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
