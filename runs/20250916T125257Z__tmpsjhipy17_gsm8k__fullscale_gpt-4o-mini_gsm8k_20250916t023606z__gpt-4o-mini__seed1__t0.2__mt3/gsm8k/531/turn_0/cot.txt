To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step, calculating the number of passengers on the bus after each stop.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: 
   - There are 48 people riding the bus initially.

2. **First stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers**: 
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the first stop**:
     \[
     40 + 40 = 80
     \]

3. **Second stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers**:
     \[
     80 - 21 = 59
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: 3 times fewer passengers get on than the number who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
     \[
     \frac{21}{3} = 7
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the second stop**:
     \[
     59 + 7 = 66
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is:
     \[
     \boxed{66}
     \]
