To find the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the daily article output for each website**:
   - The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles every day.
   - The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles every day.

2. **Calculate the total daily articles published by both websites**:
   - Total daily articles = Articles from the news website + Articles from the sister company
   - Total daily articles = 20 (political and weather) + 10 (business) = 30 articles per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of articles published in February**:
   - February has 28 days.
   - Total articles in February = Total daily articles × Number of days in February
   - Total articles in February = 30 articles/day × 28 days = 840 articles.

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of articles published by the two websites together in February is **840 articles**.
