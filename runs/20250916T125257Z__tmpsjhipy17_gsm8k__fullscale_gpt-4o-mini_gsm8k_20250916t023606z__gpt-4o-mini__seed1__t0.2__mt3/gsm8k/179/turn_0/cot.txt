To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate earnings for the first week:**
   - Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
   - He tutored for 5 hours in the first week.
   - To find his earnings for the first week, we multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he worked:
     \[
     \text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings for the first week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate earnings for the second week:**
   - Again, Lloyd earns $10 per hour.
   - He tutored for 8 hours in the second week.
   - To find his earnings for the second week, we use the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings for the second week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate total earnings for the two weeks:**
   - Now, we add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, Lloyd earned a total of **$130** for the first two weeks of tutoring.

Final answer: **$130**
