To determine how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of adults**: 
   Jack is riding with 8 other adults, so the total number of adults is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Jack)} + 8 \text{ (other adults)} = 9 \text{ adults}
   \]

2. **Determine the average weight of the adults**: 
   Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all 9 adults can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Average weight per adult}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Identify the maximum load of the elevator**: 
   The maximum load that the elevator can support is given as 700 kg.

4. **Calculate the excess weight**: 
   To find out how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Maximum load}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   The total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by } 20 \text{ kg.}
\]
