To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty program, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent. 

   \[
   \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
   \]

   Therefore, the customer earned **$4 in rewards**.

2. **Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $43 on their current shopping trip.

3. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   The customer has $4 in rewards. They can use this to reduce the price of their current purchase. 

   \[
   \text{Price after applying rewards} = \text{Amount spent} - \text{Rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39
   \]

   So, after applying the rewards, the price is **$39**.

4. **Apply the coupon:**
   The problem states that the customer applied a coupon that took **twice the amount of rewards off the price**. Since the customer has $4 in rewards, the coupon will take:

   \[
   \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the final amount the customer pays:**
   Now we subtract the coupon discount from the price after applying the rewards:

   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Price after applying rewards} - \text{Coupon discount} = 39 - 8 = 31
   \]

Thus, the customer pays **$31** on this shopping trip.

**Final Answer: $31**
