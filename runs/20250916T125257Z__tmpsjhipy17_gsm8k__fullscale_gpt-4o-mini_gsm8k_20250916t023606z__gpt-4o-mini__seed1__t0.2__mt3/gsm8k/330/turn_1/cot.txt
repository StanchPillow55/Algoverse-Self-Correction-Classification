To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty card rules, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent.

   \[
   \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   So, the customer has $4 in rewards.

2. **Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip:**
   The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.

3. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip:**
   The customer has $4 in rewards, which they can use to reduce the cost of their current purchase. However, the problem states that they applied a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price.

   \[
   \text{Total discount from rewards and coupon} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the final amount paid after applying the discount:**
   Now, we subtract the total discount from the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = \text{Amount spent} - \text{Total discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = 43 - 8 = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the customer paid **$35** on this shopping trip.

Final answer: **$35**
