To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total amount the customer paid on their shopping trip.

### Step 1: Calculate Rewards Earned
The customer earns $1 off for every $20 spent. On their last shopping trip, they spent $80.

1. Calculate the number of $20 increments in $80:
   \[
   \text{Number of increments} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
   \]
2. Therefore, the total rewards earned from this shopping trip is:
   \[
   \text{Rewards} = 4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount Spent on the Current Shopping Trip
On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.

### Step 3: Apply Rewards to the Current Purchase
The customer has $4 in rewards from their previous shopping trip. They will use these rewards on their current purchase.

1. Subtract the rewards from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Amount after rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 4: Apply the Coupon
The customer has a coupon that takes off twice the amount of rewards. Since they have $4 in rewards, the coupon will take off:
\[
\text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Final Amount Paid
Now, we subtract the coupon discount from the amount after applying the rewards:
\[
\text{Final amount paid} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion
The customer paid a total of **$31** on this shopping trip.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
