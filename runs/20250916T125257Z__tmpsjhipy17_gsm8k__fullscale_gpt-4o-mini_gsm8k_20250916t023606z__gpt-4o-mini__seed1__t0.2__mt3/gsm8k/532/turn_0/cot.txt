To solve the problem, we will first determine Jame's current age and then find out his cousin's current age based on the information given.

1. **Determine Jame's current age:**
   - We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. 
   - Therefore, his current age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Current age of Jame} = 27 - 5 = 22
     \]

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years:**
   - In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
     \[
     \text{Age of Jame in 8 years} = 22 + 8 = 30
     \]

3. **Determine the cousin's age in 8 years:**
   - According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.
   - Therefore, the cousin's age in 8 years can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times \text{Age of Jame in 8 years} - 5
     \]
   - Substituting Jame's age in 8 years:
     \[
     \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 2 \times 30 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
     \]

4. **Determine the cousin's current age:**
   - Since we know the cousin's age in 8 years, we can find the cousin's current age by subtracting 8 years:
     \[
     \text{Current age of cousin} = 55 - 8 = 47
     \]

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin:**
   - Now that we have both Jame's current age (22) and his cousin's current age (47), we can find the difference in their ages:
     \[
     \text{Age difference} = \text{Current age of cousin} - \text{Current age of Jame} = 47 - 22 = 25
     \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of Jame and his cousin now is \( \boxed{25} \).
