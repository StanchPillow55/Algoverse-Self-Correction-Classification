To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many toys the first four workers produce during their 10-hour shift and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order of 400 toys.

### Step 1: Calculate the production of the first two workers
The first two workers produce 6 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
\[
\text{Production of first 2 workers} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the production of the next two workers
The next two workers produce 4 toys per hour each. Therefore, their combined production per hour is:
\[
\text{Production of next 2 workers} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production of all four workers
Now, we can find the total production per hour of all four workers:
\[
\text{Total production per hour} = 12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys per hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift
Since all four workers work for 10 hours, the total number of toys produced by them during the shift is:
\[
\text{Total production in 10 hours} = 20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of toys needed
The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys. After the first four workers have produced 200 toys, the number of toys still needed is:
\[
\text{Toys still needed} = 400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys}
\]

### Step 6: Determine the production of the fifth worker
Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production of the fifth worker over the shift is:
\[
\text{Total production of fifth worker} = 10x
\]

### Step 7: Set up the equation
To meet the order, the total production of the fifth worker must equal the number of toys still needed:
\[
10x = 200
\]

### Step 8: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{200}{10} = 20
\]

### Final Answer
The fifth worker produces **20 toys per hour**.
