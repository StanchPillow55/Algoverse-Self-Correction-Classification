To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many toys the first four workers produce during their shift and then determine how many toys the fifth worker must produce to meet the order of 400 toys.

### Step 1: Calculate the production of the first two workers
- There are 2 workers who produce 6 toys per hour.
- In a 10-hour shift, the total production for these 2 workers is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 2 workers} = 2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the production of the next two workers
- There are another 2 workers who produce 4 toys per hour.
- In a 10-hour shift, the total production for these 2 workers is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 2 workers} = 2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production of the first four workers
- Now, we add the production from both groups of workers:
  \[
  \text{Total toys produced by 4 workers} = 120 \text{ toys} + 80 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 4: Determine how many toys are still needed
- The total order is for 400 toys, and the workers produced 200 toys. Therefore, the number of toys still needed is:
  \[
  \text{Toys still needed} = 400 \text{ toys} - 200 \text{ toys} = 200 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the production of the fifth worker
- Let \( x \) be the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. The fifth worker also works for 10 hours, so the total production by the fifth worker is:
  \[
  \text{Toys produced by 5th worker} = x \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 10x \text{ toys}
  \]

- We know that the total production from all workers must equal the order of 400 toys:
  \[
  200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys} = 400 \text{ toys}
  \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearranging the equation gives:
  \[
  10x = 400 - 200
  \]
  \[
  10x = 200
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{200}{10} = 20
  \]

### Final Answer
The fifth worker produces **20 toys per hour**.
