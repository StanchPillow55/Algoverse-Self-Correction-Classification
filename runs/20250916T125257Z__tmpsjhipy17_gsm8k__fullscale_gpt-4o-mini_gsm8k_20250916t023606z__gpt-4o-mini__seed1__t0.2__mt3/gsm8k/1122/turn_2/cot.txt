To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys the fifth worker produces per hour. Let's break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Identify the production rates of the workers:**
   - There are 5 workers in total.
   - 2 workers produce 6 toys per hour each.
   - 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour each.
   - We need to find the production rate of the 5th worker, which we will denote as \( x \) (toys per hour).

2. **Calculate the total production of the first four workers:**
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 6 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 6 \text{ toys/hour} = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - The total production from the 2 workers who produce 4 toys/hour:
     \[
     2 \text{ workers} \times 4 \text{ toys/hour} = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total production rate of the first four workers combined is:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys/hour} + 8 \text{ toys/hour} = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total production over the 10-hour shift:**
   - The total number of toys produced by the first four workers in 10 hours is:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Determine the total toys produced including the fifth worker:**
   - Let \( x \) be the production rate of the fifth worker. In 10 hours, the fifth worker produces:
     \[
     10x \text{ toys}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of toys produced by all workers is:
     \[
     200 \text{ toys} + 10x \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Set up the equation based on the order requirement:**
   - The manufacturer needs to produce a total of 400 toys, but they still need 20 toys after the shift. Thus, they have produced:
     \[
     400 \text{ toys} - 20 \text{ toys} = 380 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     200 + 10x = 380
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     10x = 380 - 200
     \]
     \[
     10x = 180
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{180}{10} = 18
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The fifth worker produces **18 toys per hour**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
