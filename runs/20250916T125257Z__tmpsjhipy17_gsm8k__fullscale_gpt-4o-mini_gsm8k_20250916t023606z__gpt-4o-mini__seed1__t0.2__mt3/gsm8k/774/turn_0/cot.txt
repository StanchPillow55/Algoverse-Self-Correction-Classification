To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving to the museum and back, as well as the time he spends at the museum.

### Step 1: Calculate the driving time to the museum

The distance to the museum is 150 miles, and Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the trip to the museum:

\[
\text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the driving time back home

The return trip is the same distance (150 miles) and the same speed (75 mph), so the time for the return trip is also:

\[
\text{Time back home} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total driving time

Now we add the time spent driving to the museum and back:

\[
\text{Total driving time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time Jack is gone

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time he is gone from home is the sum of the total driving time and the time spent at the museum:

\[
\text{Total time gone} = \text{Total driving time} + \text{Time at museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Jack is gone from home for a total of **10 hours**.
