To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Deanna's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Deanna is 26 years old.

2. **Determine Marcus's Age**: 
   The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's Age} = \text{Deanna's Age} - 5
   \]
   Substituting Deanna's age:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's Age} = 26 - 5 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine Leo's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's Age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's Age}
   \]
   We already calculated Marcus's age to be 21, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's Age}
   \]
   To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \text{Leo's Age} = 21 \times 2 = 42
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   After calculating, we find that Leo is 42 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Leo's Age} = 42
\]
