Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the three players is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \).

From the second equation, we can express \( A \):
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation, we can express \( D \):
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now we can substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this equation:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Now, we add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Next, we divide by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5
\]
\[
D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Now we can check our work by verifying the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
