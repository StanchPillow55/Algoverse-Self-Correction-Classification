To solve the problem, we will go through the steps one by one, calculating how many lollipops Erin has at each stage.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**:
   Erin starts with 7 lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Initial lollipops} = 7
   \]

2. **Lollipops Given by Mother**:
   Erin's mother gives her 10 more lollipops. We need to add these to the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops after receiving from mother} = 7 + 10 = 17
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Ella**:
   Erin then gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella. We need to subtract these from the total she has after receiving from her mother.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops after giving to Ella} = 17 - 3 = 14
   \]

4. **Final Count of Lollipops**:
   After giving away 3 lollipops, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Erin has } 14 \text{ lollipops left.}
\]
