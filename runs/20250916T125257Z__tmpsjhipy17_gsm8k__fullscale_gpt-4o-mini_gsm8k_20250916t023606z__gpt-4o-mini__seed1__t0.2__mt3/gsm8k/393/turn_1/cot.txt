To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity**:
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of the writing time, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all times to the same unit**:
   - We will convert everything to hours for consistency.
   - 90 minutes can be converted to hours by dividing by 60:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total work time**:
   - Now we can add the time spent on each activity:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   - The time spent editing is 1.5 hours. To find the percentage of the total time that this represents, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
     \]

5. **Perform the calculation**:
   - First, calculate \( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \):
     \[
     \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
     \]
   - Now multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing the song.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20\%}
\]
