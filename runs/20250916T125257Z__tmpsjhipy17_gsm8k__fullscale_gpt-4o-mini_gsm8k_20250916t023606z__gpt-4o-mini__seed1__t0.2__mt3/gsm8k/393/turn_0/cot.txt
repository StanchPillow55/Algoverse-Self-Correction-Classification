To find out what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we first need to calculate the total time she spent on each activity and then determine the percentage of that total time that was spent editing.

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Writing the song: 4 hours
   - Recording the song: Half of the writing time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Recording time} = \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Editing the song: 90 minutes. We need to convert this into hours for consistency:
     \[
     \text{Editing time} = \frac{90 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total work time:**
   Now, we add up all the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Writing time} + \text{Recording time} + \text{Editing time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing:**
   To find the percentage of the total time that was spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Editing time}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Carol spent **20%** of her total work time editing the song.
