To solve the problem, we need to determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost of those plants.

### Step 1: Convert Measurements
First, we need to ensure all measurements are in the same unit. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and the width of each flower is given in inches. We will convert the width of the flowers from inches to feet.

- **Width of each flower**: 12 inches = 12 / 12 = 1 foot

### Step 2: Calculate the Space Required for Each Plant
Each plant occupies its width plus the space needed between plants. Since each plant is 1 foot wide and there is a 1.5-foot gap between each plant, the total space required for each plant is:

- **Space per plant** = Width of plant + Space between plants
- **Space per plant** = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet

### Step 3: Determine How Many Plants Fit in the Flower Bed
Next, we will calculate how many plants can fit in the 111-foot flower bed.

- **Number of plants that can fit** = Total length of flower bed / Space per plant
- **Number of plants that can fit** = 111 feet / 2.5 feet = 44.4

Since Pat cannot have a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:

- **Number of plants that can fit** = 44 plants

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Additional Plants Needed
Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more plants she needs to buy.

- **Additional plants needed** = Total plants that can fit - Plants already owned
- **Additional plants needed** = 44 - 17 = 27 plants

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Cost
Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional plants is:

- **Total cost** = Additional plants needed × Cost per plant
- **Total cost** = 27 plants × $6/plant = $162

### Final Answer
Pat will spend **$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed.
