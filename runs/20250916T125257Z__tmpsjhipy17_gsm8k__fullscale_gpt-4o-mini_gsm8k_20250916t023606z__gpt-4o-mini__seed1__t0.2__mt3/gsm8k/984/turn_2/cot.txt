To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Convert the length of the flower bed to inches**: Since the width of the flowers is given in inches, we should convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. 

   \[
   1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} = 111 \times 12 = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total space each flower occupies**: Each flower has a width of 12 inches, and Pat needs to leave a space of 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each flower. Therefore, the total space occupied by each flower, including the space between them, is:

   \[
   \text{Space per flower} = \text{Width of flower} + \text{Space between flowers} = 12 \text{ inches} + 18 \text{ inches} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**: To find out how many flowers can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed (in inches) by the total space occupied by each flower:

   \[
   \text{Number of flowers} = \frac{\text{Total length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per flower}} = \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches}} \approx 44.4
   \]

   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number:

   \[
   \text{Number of flowers that can be planted} = 44
   \]

4. **Calculate how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more flowers she needs to buy:

   \[
   \text{Additional flowers needed} = \text{Total flowers needed} - \text{Flowers owned} = 44 - 17 = 27
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional flowers**: Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional flowers is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Additional flowers needed} \times \text{Cost per flower} = 27 \times 6 = 162
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{162}
\]

Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.
