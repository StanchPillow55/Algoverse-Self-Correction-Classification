To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the dimensions to the same unit**: 
   The flower bed is 111 feet long. Since the flowers grow 12 inches wide and we need to leave space between them, we will convert everything to feet. 
   - 12 inches = 12/12 = 1 foot.

2. **Calculate the total space each plant occupies**: 
   Each plant occupies 1 foot (width of the plant) plus 1.5 feet (space between plants). 
   - Total space per plant = 1 foot + 1.5 feet = 2.5 feet.

3. **Determine how many plants can fit in the flower bed**: 
   We will divide the total length of the flower bed by the total space each plant occupies.
   \[
   \text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet/plant}}.
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4.
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   - Maximum number of plants = 44.

4. **Calculate how many additional plants Pat needs**: 
   Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more she needs to buy:
   \[
   \text{Additional plants needed} = \text{Maximum number of plants} - \text{Plants owned} = 44 - 17 = 27.
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the additional plants**: 
   Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the additional plants is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Additional plants needed} \times \text{Cost per plant} = 27 \times 6.
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   27 \times 6 = 162.
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   Pat will spend a total of $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]
