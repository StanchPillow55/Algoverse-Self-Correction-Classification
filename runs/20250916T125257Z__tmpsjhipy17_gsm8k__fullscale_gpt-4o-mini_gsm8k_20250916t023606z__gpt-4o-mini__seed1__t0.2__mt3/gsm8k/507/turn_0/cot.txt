To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass instead of paying for individual bus trips, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of individual bus trips for one week.**
   - Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week.
   - The cost of each bus trip is $2.20.

   First, we calculate the total number of bus trips she takes in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total bus trips per week} = \text{Number of trips per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ trips}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total cost for these trips:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bus trips} = \text{Total bus trips} \times \text{Cost per trip} = 10 \times 2.20 = 22.00
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the weekly bus pass.**
   - The cost of the weekly bus pass is given as $20.

3. **Calculate the savings by comparing the total cost of individual trips to the cost of the weekly pass.**
   - We find the difference between the total cost of individual trips and the cost of the weekly pass:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost of bus trips} - \text{Cost of weekly pass} = 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Janet would save $2.00 by buying the weekly bus pass instead of paying for individual bus trips.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Janet saves } \$2.00 \text{ by buying the weekly bus pass.}
\]
