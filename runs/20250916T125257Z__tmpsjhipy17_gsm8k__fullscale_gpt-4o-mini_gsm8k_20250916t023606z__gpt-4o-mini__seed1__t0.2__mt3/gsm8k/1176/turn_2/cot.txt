To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday, given that he typically uses 20% each day.

1. **Determine the initial amount of chalk**: 
   The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday**:
   The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday**:
   To find out how much chalk is left after Monday, we subtract the amount used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine the daily usage going forward**:
   The teacher plans to use 20% of the chalk each day. We calculate this daily usage based on the remaining chalk:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk**:
   To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it becomes too small (less than 2 inches), we need to see how many days it takes for the chalk to go from 2.75 inches to 2 inches.

   First, we need to find out how much chalk can be used before it reaches 2 inches:
   \[
   \text{Chalk to be used} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

   Now, we can determine how many days it will take to use up 0.75 inches at a rate of 0.55 inches per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
   \]

   Since the teacher cannot use a fraction of a day, we round down to the nearest whole number. This means he can use the chalk for 1 full day before it becomes less than 2 inches.

6. **Final answer**:
   After using the chalk for 1 day, the teacher will have to recycle it because it will be less than 2 inches. Therefore, the teacher has **1 day** before he has to recycle this piece of chalk.

**Final Answer**: 1 day.
