To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of it on Monday.

1. **Initial Chalk Length**: The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday**: The teacher used 45% of the chalk on Monday. We calculate how much chalk this is:
   \[
   \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Remaining Chalk After Monday**: We subtract the chalk used from the initial length:
   \[
   \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Daily Chalk Usage**: The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day going forward. We calculate how much chalk he will use each day:
   \[
   \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 2.75 \text{ inches} = 0.55 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Days Before Recycling**: To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches, we need to determine how many days it takes for the remaining chalk to reach 2 inches:
   - The teacher can use the chalk until it reaches 2 inches, so we calculate the usable chalk:
   \[
   \text{Usable chalk} = 2.75 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 0.75 \text{ inches}
   \]
   - Now, we find out how many days it takes to use up this 0.75 inches at a rate of 0.55 inches per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{0.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} \approx 1.36 \text{ days}
   \]

Since the teacher can only use whole days, he can use the chalk for 1 full day before it becomes smaller than 2 inches.

6. **Final Answer**: The teacher has **1 day** before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.
