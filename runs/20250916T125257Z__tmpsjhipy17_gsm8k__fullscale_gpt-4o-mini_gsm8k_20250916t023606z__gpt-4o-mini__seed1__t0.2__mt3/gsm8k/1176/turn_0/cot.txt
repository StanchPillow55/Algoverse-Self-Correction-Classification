To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can use the remaining chalk after using 45% of the original 5-inch piece on Monday.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday
The teacher started with a 5-inch piece of chalk and used 45% of it on Monday.

\[
\text{Amount used on Monday} = 5 \text{ inches} \times 0.45 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining chalk after Monday
Now, we subtract the amount of chalk used from the original piece to find out how much is left.

\[
\text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the daily usage after Monday
The teacher plans to use only 20% of the chalk each day going forward. We need to calculate how much chalk he will use each day.

\[
\text{Daily usage} = 2.75 \text{ inches} \times 0.20 = 0.55 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many days he can use the remaining chalk
To find out how many days the teacher can continue using the remaining 2.75 inches of chalk at a rate of 0.55 inches per day, we divide the remaining chalk by the daily usage.

\[
\text{Number of days} = \frac{2.75 \text{ inches}}{0.55 \text{ inches/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
The teacher can use the remaining piece of chalk for 5 days before it becomes too small to use (less than 2 inches).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
