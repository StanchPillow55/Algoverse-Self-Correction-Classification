To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we need to account for his regular workout hours and the exceptions he noted.

1. **Regular Workout Hours**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks.
   - The total hours from these regular weeks can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Regular hours} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Adjusting for Exceptions**:
   - Josh had two exceptions where he worked out more than the regular hours:
     - For two consecutive weeks, he worked out 5 hours each week.
     - In one week, he worked out 6 hours.

   - Let's calculate the additional hours from these exceptions:
     - For the two consecutive weeks at 5 hours:
       \[
       \text{Additional hours from 5 hours/week} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
       \]
     - For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
       \[
       \text{Additional hours from 6 hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
       \]

3. **Total Additional Hours**:
   - Now, we sum the additional hours:
     \[
     \text{Total additional hours} = 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Hours**:
   - Finally, we add the regular hours and the total additional hours to find the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \text{Regular hours} + \text{Total additional hours} = 32 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 48 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{48} \text{ hours}
\]
