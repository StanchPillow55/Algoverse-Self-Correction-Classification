To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks.
   - Total hours without exceptions = 4 hours/week × 8 weeks = 32 hours.

2. **Identify the exceptions**:
   - Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. This means for those two weeks, he worked out an additional hour each week compared to the usual 4 hours.
   - He also spent 6 hours in one week, which is an additional 2 hours compared to the usual 4 hours.

3. **Calculate the additional hours due to exceptions**:
   - For the two weeks where he worked out 5 hours:
     - Additional hours for these two weeks = (5 hours - 4 hours) × 2 weeks = 1 hour × 2 = 2 hours.
   - For the week where he worked out 6 hours:
     - Additional hours for this week = (6 hours - 4 hours) = 2 hours.

4. **Total additional hours**:
   - Total additional hours = Additional hours from two weeks at 5 hours + Additional hours from one week at 6 hours.
   - Total additional hours = 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.

5. **Calculate the final total hours worked out**:
   - Total hours worked out = Total hours without exceptions + Total additional hours.
   - Total hours worked out = 32 hours + 4 hours = 36 hours.

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is **36 hours**.
