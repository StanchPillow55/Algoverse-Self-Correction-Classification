To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks. Therefore, the total hours for these weeks is:
   \[
   \text{Total hours without exceptions} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Identify the exceptions**:
   - For two consecutive weeks, Josh spent 5 hours each week.
   - In another week, he spent 6 hours.

3. **Calculate the hours for the weeks with exceptions**:
   - For the two consecutive weeks where he spent 5 hours each:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 2 weeks} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]
   - For the week where he spent 6 hours:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 1 week} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours spent on exceptions**:
   Now, we add the hours from the weeks with exceptions:
   \[
   \text{Total hours for exceptions} = 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total hours spent working out**:
   To find the total hours Josh spent working out, we need to adjust the initial total (32 hours) by subtracting the hours he would have spent during the weeks he worked out 4 hours (for the weeks he worked out more) and adding the hours he actually worked out during those weeks.
   
   Since he worked out 4 hours for 6 weeks (the remaining weeks after accounting for the 3 weeks with exceptions), we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Hours for 6 weeks at 4 hours/week} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we add the hours from the exceptions:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 24 \text{ hours} + 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
   \[
   \boxed{40} \text{ hours}
   \]
