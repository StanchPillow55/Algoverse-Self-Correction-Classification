To determine how many oranges in the basket are good, we need to analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Total number of oranges**: We know that there are a total of 25 oranges in the basket.

2. **Identifying the bad orange**: It is stated that there is 1 bad orange. This means that out of the total, 1 orange is not good.

3. **Calculating the number of unripe oranges**: We are told that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

4. **Identifying the sour oranges**: We know that there are 2 sour oranges. 

5. **Calculating the total number of non-good oranges**: Now we need to sum up all the non-good oranges:
   - 1 bad orange
   - 5 unripe oranges
   - 2 sour oranges

   Therefore, the total number of non-good oranges is:
   \[
   \text{Total non-good oranges} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
   \]

6. **Calculating the number of good oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges:
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total non-good oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **17 good oranges** in the basket.
