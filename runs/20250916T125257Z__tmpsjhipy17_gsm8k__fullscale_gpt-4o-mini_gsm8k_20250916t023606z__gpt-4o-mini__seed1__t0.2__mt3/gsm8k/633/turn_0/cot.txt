To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up the problem using the concept of relative speed and distance.

1. **Identify the initial conditions**:
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the relative speed**:
   - Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can find the relative speed by subtracting Bob's speed from Tom's speed:
   \[
   \text{Relative speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up**:
   - To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}}
   \]
   - The distance that Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is 75 miles (the distance Bob is ahead).
   - Using the relative speed we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]
