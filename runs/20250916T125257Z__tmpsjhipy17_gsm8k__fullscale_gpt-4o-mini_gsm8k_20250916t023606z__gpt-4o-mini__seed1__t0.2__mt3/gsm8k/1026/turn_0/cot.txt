To solve the problem, we need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe and then scale that up to 40 dwarves over a month.

1. **Calculate the mining capacity of one dwarf with different tools:**
   - **Bare hands:** One dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day.
   - **Iron pickaxe:** A dwarf can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Ore mined with iron pickaxe} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]
   - **Steel pickaxe:** A dwarf can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe. Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Ore mined with steel pickaxe} = 24 + 0.5 \times 24 = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total ore mined by one dwarf with a steel pickaxe in a month:**
   - There are 30 days in a month, so the total ore mined by one dwarf in a month is:
     \[
     \text{Total ore per month} = 36 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total ore mined by 40 dwarves in a month:**
   - If one dwarf can mine 1080 pounds in a month, then 40 dwarves can mine:
     \[
     \text{Total ore for 40 dwarves} = 40 \times 1080 = 43200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of ore that 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month is:
     \[
     \boxed{43200} \text{ pounds}
     \]
