To solve the problem, we need to determine how many votes the loser received in the election for class representative.

1. **Identify the total number of votes**: 
   The problem states that the total number of students who voted is 80.

2. **Determine the number of votes the winner received**: 
   According to the problem, the winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. We can calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total votes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of votes the loser received**: 
   Since the total number of votes is 80, we can find the number of votes the loser received by subtracting the number of votes the winner received from the total votes:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60
   \]

   Performing the subtraction gives us:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The number of votes the loser received is \( \boxed{20} \).
