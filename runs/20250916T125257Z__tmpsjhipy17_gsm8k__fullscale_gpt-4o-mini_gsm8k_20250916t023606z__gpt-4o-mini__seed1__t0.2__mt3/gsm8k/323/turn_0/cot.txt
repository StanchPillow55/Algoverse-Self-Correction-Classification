To solve the problem, we need to determine how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes due to the cooling process and the addition of cream.

### Step 1: Determine the number of ice cubes used
Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. We can find out how many ice cubes she needs by dividing the total cooling desired by the cooling effect of one ice cube:

\[
\text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling desired}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weakening effect of the ice cubes
Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening effect from the 5 ice cubes is:

\[
\text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \times 12 \text{ milliliters} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weakening effect of the cream
Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, we can consider the cream as contributing to the weakening effect. The weakening effect from the cream is:

\[
\text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total weakening effect
Now, we can find the total weakening effect by adding the weakening effects from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[
\text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Final Answer
Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.

\[
\boxed{75}
\]
