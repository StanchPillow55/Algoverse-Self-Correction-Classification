To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem and calculate the total amount donated by others before the lawyer's contribution.

1. **Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and online fund:**
   - Amount collected from neighbors: $500
   - Amount collected from the online fund: $1500

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total from neighbors and online fund} = 500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]

2. **Add the contribution from Walter's friend:**
   - Walter's friend contributes: $200

   We add this amount to the previous total:
   \[
   \text{Total before lawyer's contribution} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

3. **Calculate the lawyer's contribution:**
   - The lawyer donates three times the total amount collected from everyone else (neighbors, online fund, and friend). Therefore, we need to calculate:
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times \text{Total before lawyer's contribution}
   \]
   Substituting the total we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2200 = 6600
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Walter's lawyer will contribute **$6600**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6600}
\]
