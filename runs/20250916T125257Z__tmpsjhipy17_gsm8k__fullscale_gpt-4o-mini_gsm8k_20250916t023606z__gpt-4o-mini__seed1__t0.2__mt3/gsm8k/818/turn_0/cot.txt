To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cars Joe has initially.**
2. **Calculate how many cars Joe sells.**
3. **Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother.**
4. **Calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away.**

### Step 1: Determine how many cars Joe has initially.

We know from the problem that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert. Robert has 20 cars.

\[
\text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars Robert has} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, Joe initially has 40 cars.

### Step 2: Calculate how many cars Joe sells.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars this is, we calculate 20% of 40.

\[
\text{Number of cars sold} = 20\% \times 40 = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 0.2 \times 40 = 8
\]

So, Joe sells 8 cars.

### Step 3: Calculate how many cars Joe gives to his mother.

According to the problem, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[
\text{Number of cars given to mother} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars sold} = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

So, Joe gives 16 cars to his mother.

### Step 4: Calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away.

Now we need to find out how many cars Joe has left after selling 8 cars and giving away 16 cars. We start with the initial number of cars Joe has (40), subtract the number of cars sold (8), and then subtract the number of cars given to his mother (16).

\[
\text{Cars left} = \text{Initial cars} - \text{Cars sold} - \text{Cars given to mother}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Cars left} = 40 - 8 - 16
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Subtract the cars sold:
   \[
   40 - 8 = 32
   \]

2. Subtract the cars given to mother:
   \[
   32 - 16 = 16
   \]

Thus, Joe has 16 cars remaining after selling and giving some to his mother.

### Final Answer

Joe remains with **16 cars**.
