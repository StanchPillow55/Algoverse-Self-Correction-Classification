To solve the problem, we need to determine how many video games Bobby has based on the information given about Brian's video games.

1. **Determine the number of video games Brian currently has:**
   - We know that Brian originally had 20 video games.
   - However, he lost 5 video games before the comparison was made.
   - Therefore, the number of video games Brian currently has is:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15
     \]

2. **Understand the relationship between Bobby's and Brian's video games:**
   - The problem states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.
   - We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( B \) represent the number of video games Bobby has, and let \( R \) represent the number of video games Brian has after losing some.
   - From the problem, we have:
     \[
     B = 3R - 5
     \]

3. **Substitute Brian's current number of video games into the equation:**
   - We found that \( R = 15 \) (the number of video games Brian currently has).
   - Now we substitute \( R \) into the equation for \( B \):
     \[
     B = 3(15) - 5
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of \( B \):**
   - First, calculate \( 3 \times 15 \):
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45
     \]
   - Now, subtract 5 from 45:
     \[
     45 - 5 = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, Bobby has \( B = 40 \) video games.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
