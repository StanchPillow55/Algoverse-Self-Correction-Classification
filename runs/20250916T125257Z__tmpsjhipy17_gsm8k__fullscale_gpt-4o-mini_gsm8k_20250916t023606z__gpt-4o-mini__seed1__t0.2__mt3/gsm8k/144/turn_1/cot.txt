To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine both his total income and total expenses.

1. **Determine the total number of clients:**
   - Kim currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 potential clients.
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires:
     - 2 bottles of bleach
     - 1 pack of cloths
   - Cost of supplies:
     - Cost of 1 bottle of bleach = $2
     - Cost of 1 pack of cloths = $5

   - Total cost for supplies per client:
     \[
     \text{Cost per client} = (2 \text{ bottles} \times 2 \text{ dollars}) + (1 \text{ pack} \times 5 \text{ dollars}) = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total expenses for all clients:
     \[
     \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost per client} \times \text{Total clients} = 9 \text{ dollars} \times 8 = 72 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine total income:**
   - Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

4. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total expenses}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 92 \text{ dollars} - 72 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.
