To determine Kim's weekly profit, we need to calculate his total expenses and then subtract these from his total income.

1. **Calculate the total number of clients:**
   - Kim has 3 existing clients and is considering 5 potential clients.
   - Total clients = 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires:
     - 2 bottles of bleach
     - 1 pack of cloths
   - Cost of supplies:
     - Cost of bleach: $2 per bottle
     - Cost of cloths: $5 per pack

3. **Calculate the total cost for each client:**
   - Cost for bleach per client = 2 bottles × $2/bottle = $4
   - Cost for cloths per client = 1 pack × $5/pack = $5
   - Total cost per client = Cost for bleach + Cost for cloths
   - Total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9

4. **Calculate total expenses for all clients:**
   - Total expenses = Total cost per client × Total number of clients
   - Total expenses = $9/client × 8 clients = $72

5. **Calculate total income:**
   - Kim's total income each week = $92

6. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit = Total income - Total expenses
   - Profit = $92 - $72 = $20

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.
