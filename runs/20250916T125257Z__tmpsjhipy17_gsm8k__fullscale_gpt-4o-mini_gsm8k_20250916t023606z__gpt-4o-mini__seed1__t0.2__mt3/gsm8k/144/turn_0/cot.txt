To determine Kim's weekly profit from his housekeeping business, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of clients**: 
   - Kim currently has 3 clients and is in talks with 5 potential clients. 
   - Therefore, the total number of clients is:
     \[
     3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies**:
   - Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and 1 pack of cloths.
   - The cost of each bottle of bleach is $2, and the cost of each pack of cloths is $5.

   First, calculate the total number of bottles of bleach needed:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles of bleach} = 8 \text{ clients} \times 2 \text{ bottles/client} = 16 \text{ bottles}
   \]

   Next, calculate the total cost for the bottles of bleach:
   \[
   \text{Cost of bleach} = 16 \text{ bottles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, calculate the total number of packs of cloths needed:
   \[
   \text{Total packs of cloths} = 8 \text{ clients} \times 1 \text{ pack/client} = 8 \text{ packs}
   \]

   Then, calculate the total cost for the packs of cloths:
   \[
   \text{Cost of cloths} = 8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total expenses by adding the costs of bleach and cloths:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of bleach} + \text{Cost of cloths} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 40 \text{ dollars} = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   - Profit is defined as the difference between total income and total expenses.
   - Kim's total income each week is $92.

   Therefore, the profit can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total expenses} = 92 \text{ dollars} - 72 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.
