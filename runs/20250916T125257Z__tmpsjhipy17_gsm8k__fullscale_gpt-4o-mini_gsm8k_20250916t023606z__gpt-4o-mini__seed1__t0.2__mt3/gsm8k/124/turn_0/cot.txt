To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps**: 
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.

2. **Determine how many letters Jennie stamps**: 
   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. To find out how many letters that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]
   So, Jennie stamps 20 letters.

3. **Calculate the number of letters remaining that still need stamps**: 
   After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters that still need stamps is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining letters needing stamps} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Identify the total number of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamps**: 
   We know that after Jennie stamps the letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

5. **Set up the equation to find the initial number of already-stamped letters**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started. After Jennie stamps 20 letters, the total number of already-stamped letters becomes:
   \[
   x + 20
   \]
   According to the problem, this total equals 30:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \( \boxed{10} \).
