To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the daily food cost for all fish**:
   - Jen has 3 fish.
   - Each fish requires $1 worth of food per day.
   - Therefore, the total daily cost for food for all fish is:
     \[
     \text{Total daily cost} = \text{Number of fish} \times \text{Cost per fish per day} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of days in May**:
   - May has 31 days.

3. **Calculate the total cost for the month of May**:
   - To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for May} = \text{Total daily cost} \times \text{Number of days in May} = 3 \times 31
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     3 \times 31 = 93 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Jen spends a total of **$93** on food for her fish in the month of May.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{93}
\]
