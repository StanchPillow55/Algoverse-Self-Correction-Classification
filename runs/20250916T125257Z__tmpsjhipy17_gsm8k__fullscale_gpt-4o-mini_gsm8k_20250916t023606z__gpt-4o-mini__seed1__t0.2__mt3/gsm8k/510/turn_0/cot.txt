To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs.**
   - We know that to lose 1 lb, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - Therefore, to lose 30 lbs, the total calories he needs to burn is:
     \[
     30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the time frame from December 31st to July 19th.**
   - We need to count the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
   - The months and their respective days are as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days (up to and including July 19th)
   - Now, we add these days together:
     \[
     31 \text{ (Jan)} + 28 \text{ (Feb)} + 31 \text{ (Mar)} + 30 \text{ (Apr)} + 31 \text{ (May)} + 30 \text{ (Jun)} + 19 \text{ (Jul)} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
     \]
     \[
     59 + 31 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 30 = 120
     \]
     \[
     120 + 19 = 139
     \]
   - So, there are **139 days** from December 31st to July 19th.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit needed.**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Daily Calorie Deficit} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{139 \text{ days}} \approx 755.40 \text{ calories/day}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately **755.40 calories** each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{755.40}
\]
