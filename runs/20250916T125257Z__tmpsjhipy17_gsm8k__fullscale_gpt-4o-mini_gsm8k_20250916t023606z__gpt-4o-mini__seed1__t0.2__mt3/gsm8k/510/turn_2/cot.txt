To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs.**
   - We know that to lose 1 lb., Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - Therefore, to lose 30 lbs., the total calories he needs to burn is:
     \[
     30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the time frame from today (December 31st) to his birthday (July 19th).**
   - We need to calculate the number of days between December 31 and July 19.
   - The breakdown of the months is as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days
   - Now, we add these days together:
     \[
     31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
     \]
     \[
     59 + 31 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 30 = 120
     \]
     \[
     120 + 31 = 151
     \]
     \[
     151 + 30 = 181
     \]
     \[
     181 + 19 = 200
     \]
   - So, there are 200 days from December 31 to July 19.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days he has:
   \[
   \text{Daily Calorie Deficit} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of **525 calories** to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{525}
\]
