To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs.**
   - We know that to lose 1 lb, Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - Therefore, to lose 30 lbs, the total calories he needs to burn is:
     \[
     \text{Total calories to burn} = 30 \, \text{lbs} \times 3500 \, \text{calories/lb} = 105000 \, \text{calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the time frame from December 31st to July 19th.**
   - From December 31st to July 19th, we need to count the number of days.
   - The breakdown of the months is as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (2024 is not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days
   - Now, we add these days together:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
     \]
     \[
     59 + 31 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 30 = 120
     \]
     \[
     120 + 19 = 139
     \]
   - So, there are 199 days from December 31st to July 19th.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days he has to achieve this:
   \[
   \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{\text{Total calories to burn}}{\text{Total days}} = \frac{105000 \, \text{calories}}{199 \, \text{days}} \approx 528.64 \, \text{calories/day}
   \]

4. **Final answer.**
   - Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of approximately 529 calories (rounding to the nearest whole number) to achieve his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{529} \text{ calories/day}
\]
