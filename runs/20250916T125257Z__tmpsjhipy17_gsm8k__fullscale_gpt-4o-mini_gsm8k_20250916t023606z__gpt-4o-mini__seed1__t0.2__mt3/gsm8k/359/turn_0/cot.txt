To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps.

1. **Determine the total amount Billy has**: 
   Billy has $10 from his father.

2. **Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy buys**. 
   The cost of candy is $1.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) pounds of candy is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of candy} = 1.5x
   \]

3. **Calculate the change Billy has after buying the candy**:
   After buying the candy, the amount of money Billy has left (his change) is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 10 - 1.5x
   \]

4. **Determine how much he spends on gumballs**:
   Billy takes half of his change to buy gumballs. Therefore, the amount he spends on gumballs is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on gumballs} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 - 1.5x) = 5 - 0.75x
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of gumballs**:
   Each gumball costs $0.05. If he buys 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of gumballs} = 0.05 \times 40 = 2
   \]

6. **Set up the equation**:
   Since the amount Billy spends on gumballs must equal the cost of the gumballs, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5 - 0.75x = 2
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( 0.75x \):
   \[
   5 - 2 = 0.75x
   \]
   \[
   3 = 0.75x
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 0.75:
   \[
   x = \frac{3}{0.75}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
