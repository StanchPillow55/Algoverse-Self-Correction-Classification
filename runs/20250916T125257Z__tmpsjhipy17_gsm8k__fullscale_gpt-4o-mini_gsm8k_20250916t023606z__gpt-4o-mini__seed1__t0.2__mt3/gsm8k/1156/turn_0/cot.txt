To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total profit Linus earns from buying and selling mobile devices. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the devices:**
   - Linus buys each mobile device for $20.
   - On Monday, he buys 2 devices:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - On Tuesday, he buys 4 devices:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for all devices he bought is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost on Monday} + \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the selling price of the devices:**
   - Linus sells each mobile device for twice the amount he bought it for:
     \[
     \text{Selling Price per device} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - He bought a total of \(2 + 4 = 6\) devices.
   - Therefore, the total selling price for all devices is:
     \[
     \text{Total Selling Price} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total selling price minus the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Linus earned a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
