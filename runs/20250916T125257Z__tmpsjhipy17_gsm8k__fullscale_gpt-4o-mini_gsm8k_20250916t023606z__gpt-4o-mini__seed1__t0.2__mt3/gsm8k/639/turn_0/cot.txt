To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
V = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. First, calculate the area of the base (length Ã— width):
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. Next, multiply the area of the base by the depth to find the volume:
   \[
   24 \, \text{square feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

Now that we have the volume of the hole, we know that Bob will be digging out 72 cubic feet of earth.

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig this volume of earth. We know from the problem statement that it takes him 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time \( T \) it will take him to dig 72 cubic feet, we can multiply the volume by the time per cubic foot:

\[
T = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
T = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds/cubic foot}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
T = 72 \times 3 = 216 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, it will take Bob a total of 216 seconds to dig the hole.

Finally, we can convert this time into minutes for a more intuitive understanding:

\[
\text{Minutes} = \frac{216 \, \text{seconds}}{60 \, \text{seconds/minute}} = 3.6 \, \text{minutes}
\]

However, since the question specifically asks for the time in seconds, we will state our final answer in seconds.

**Final Answer: Bob will take 216 seconds to dig the hole.**
