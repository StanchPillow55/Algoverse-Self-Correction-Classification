To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of holes dug by the pirates over the first three days and then determining how many holes they dug on the fourth day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug in the first three days.

- **Day 1:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
- **Day 2:** The pirates dug 13 holes.
- **Day 3:** The pirates dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

First, we calculate the total number of holes dug on Day 3 before filling in the holes:
\[
\text{Holes dug on Day 3} = 8
\]
Next, we account for the holes that were filled in:
\[
\text{Holes remaining after filling} = 8 - 2 = 6
\]

Now, we can find the total number of holes dug after three days:
\[
\text{Total holes after Day 3} = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of holes at the end of the first day.

At the end of the first day, the total number of holes dug is:
\[
\text{Holes at the end of Day 1} = 10
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of holes at the end of the fourth day.

According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the total number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day:
\[
\text{Total holes at the end of Day 4} = 4 \times \text{Holes at the end of Day 1} = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day.

Let \( x \) be the number of holes dug on the fourth day. The total number of holes at the end of the fourth day can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total holes at the end of Day 4} = \text{Total holes after Day 3} + x
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
40 = 29 + x
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 40 - 29 = 11
\]

### Final Answer

The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
