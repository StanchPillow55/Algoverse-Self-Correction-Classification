To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has over the four days, accounting for the losses each day.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **Day 1**: 
   - Amount before children drank: 24 gallons
   - Amount drunk by children: 4 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 1: 
     \[
     24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Day 2**:
   - Amount before spill: 20 gallons
   - Amount spilled by Barbie: 7 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 2: 
     \[
     20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Day 3**:
   - Amount before friend drank: 13 gallons
   - Amount drunk by Ronnie: 5 gallons
   - Remaining after Day 3: 
     \[
     13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Day 4**:
   - Amount before the party: 8 gallons
   - Number of people at the party: 3 (Fred and 2 others)
   - Amount of root beer available for each person:
     \[
     \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.
