To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each event leading up to the party.

1. **Initial amount of root beer**: Fred made 24 gallons on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After children drank some**: The children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After wife spilled some**: Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After friend drank some**: Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after friend} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Number of people at the party**: There are 3 guests plus Fred, making a total of 4 people.
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

6. **Amount of root beer available per person**: We divide the remaining root beer by the number of people.
   \[
   \text{Root beer per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person at the party can drink **2 gallons** of root beer.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink 2 gallons of root beer.
