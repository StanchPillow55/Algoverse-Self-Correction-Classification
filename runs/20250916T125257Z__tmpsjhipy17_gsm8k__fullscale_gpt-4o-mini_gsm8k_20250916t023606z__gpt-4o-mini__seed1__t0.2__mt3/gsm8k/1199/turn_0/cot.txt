To solve the problem, we will track the amount of root beer Fred has after each day and then determine how much each person can drink at the party.

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer:**
   Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After the Children Drank Some:**
   Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie Spilled Some:**
   On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Barbie} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie Took Some:**
   On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Amount after Ronnie} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Amount Available for the Party:**
   On the fourth day, there are 8 gallons of root beer left. There are 3 people (Fred and 2 others) at the party.

   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3
   \]

   To find out how much root beer each person can drink, we divide the remaining amount by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer during the party.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Each person can drink } \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons of root beer.}
\]
