To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   - Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   - Total reservations per week = Reservations per night × Days open per week
   \[
   \text{Total reservations per week} = 6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of meals and wine per reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals at $5 each and a bottle of wine at $5.
   - Cost of meals = 2 meals × $5/meal = $10
   - Cost of wine = $5
   - Total cost per reservation = Cost of meals + Cost of wine
   \[
   \text{Total cost per reservation} = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue for the week:**
   - Total revenue per week = Total reservations per week × Total cost per reservation
   \[
   \text{Total revenue per week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Finally, the total amount Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180} \text{ dollars}
\]
