To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same highway that three kangaroos can cross in 18 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the kangaroos

First, we know that 3 kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway. Let's denote the distance across the highway as \( D \).

The speed of the kangaroos can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Since there are 3 kangaroos, we can denote their combined speed as \( 3v \), where \( v \) is the speed of one kangaroo. Therefore, we have:
\[
3v = \frac{D}{18}
\]

From this, we can express the distance \( D \):
\[
D = 3v \times 18 = 54v
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

The problem states that each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of one turtle is:
\[
\text{Speed of one turtle} = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the combined speed of the four turtles

If we have 4 turtles, their combined speed is:
\[
\text{Combined speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway

Now we can use the same formula for speed to find the time it takes for the turtles to cross the highway. We know the distance \( D \) is \( 54v \) and the combined speed of the turtles is \( 2v \):
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{D}{\text{Combined speed of turtles}} = \frac{54v}{2v}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression

The \( v \) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it will take four turtles a total of **27 hours** to cross the highway.
