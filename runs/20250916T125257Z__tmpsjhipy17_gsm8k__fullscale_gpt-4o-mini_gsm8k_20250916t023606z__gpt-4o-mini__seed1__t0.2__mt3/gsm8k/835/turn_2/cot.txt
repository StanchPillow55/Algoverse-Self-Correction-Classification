To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given and break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Kangaroo Travel Time**:
   - We know that 3 kangaroos take a total of 18 hours to cross the highway. 
   - Since they are traveling at the same speed, we can determine the time it takes for one kangaroo to cross the highway. However, since they are not racing against each other (they are not competing), the time taken remains the same regardless of the number of kangaroos. Thus, it also takes 1 kangaroo 18 hours to cross the highway.

2. **Calculating the Speed of the Kangaroo**:
   - Let's denote the speed of a kangaroo as \( v_k \) and the distance across the highway as \( d \).
   - The time taken by the kangaroo to cross the highway can be expressed using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - For one kangaroo, we have:
     \[
     18 = \frac{d}{v_k}
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives us:
     \[
     d = 18 v_k
     \]

3. **Understanding the Turtle Speed**:
   - Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. Therefore, the speed of a turtle \( v_t \) is:
     \[
     v_t = \frac{1}{2} v_k
     \]

4. **Calculating the Time for Turtles**:
   - We need to find out how long it will take for 4 turtles to cross the same distance \( d \).
   - Using the same formula for time:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{d}{\text{Speed of turtles}}
     \]
   - The speed of 4 turtles is still \( v_t \), so we can substitute:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{d}{v_t} = \frac{d}{\frac{1}{2} v_k} = \frac{2d}{v_k}
     \]

5. **Substituting the Distance**:
   - We already established that \( d = 18 v_k \). Now substituting this into the equation for the time taken by the turtles:
     \[
     \text{Time for turtles} = \frac{2(18 v_k)}{v_k} = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, it will take 4 turtles a total of **36 hours** to cross the highway.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
