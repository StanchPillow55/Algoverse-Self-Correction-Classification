To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the same distance that three kangaroos can cross in 18 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the kangaroos

Letâ€™s denote the speed of one kangaroo as \( v \). Since three kangaroos take 18 hours to cross the highway, we can calculate the total distance they cover.

The distance \( d \) that the kangaroos travel can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

For three kangaroos traveling at speed \( v \):

\[
d = 3v \times 18
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
d = 54v
\]

### Step 2: Determine the speed of the turtles

Each turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of one turtle \( v_t \) is:

\[
v_t = \frac{v}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes for the turtles to cross the same distance

Now we need to find out how long it takes for four turtles to travel the same distance \( d = 54v \).

The combined speed of four turtles traveling at speed \( v_t \) is:

\[
\text{Combined speed of 4 turtles} = 4 \times v_t = 4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time taken by the turtles

Using the distance formula again, we can find the time \( t \) it takes for the turtles to travel the distance \( d \):

\[
d = \text{speed} \times \text{time}
\]

Rearranging for time gives us:

\[
t = \frac{d}{\text{speed}}
\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[
t = \frac{54v}{2v}
\]

The \( v \) cancels out:

\[
t = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

### Final Answer

It will take four turtles a total of **27 hours** to travel across the highway.
