To calculate the total charge for Patty's Plumbing, we need to break down the costs into three components: the service charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Service Charge**: This is a flat fee for visiting the house.
   \[
   \text{Service Charge} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Labor Charge**: Patty charges $35 per hour, or part thereof. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round this up to the nearest whole hour because any part of an hour counts as a full hour.
   \[
   \text{Hours Charged} = \lceil 2.25 \rceil = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the labor charge:
   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 35 \text{ dollars/hour} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts used for the job is given as $60.
   \[
   \text{Parts Cost} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we can sum all these charges to find the total amount Patty charged:
\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Service Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
\]
\[
\text{Total Charge} = 205 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{205}
\]
