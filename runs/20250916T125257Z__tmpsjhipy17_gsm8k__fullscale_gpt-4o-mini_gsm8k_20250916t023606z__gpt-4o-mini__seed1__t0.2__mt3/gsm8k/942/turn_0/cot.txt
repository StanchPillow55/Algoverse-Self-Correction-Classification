To determine how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we need to break down the costs into three components: the service charge for visiting the house, the labor charge based on the hours worked, and the cost of parts used.

1. **Service Charge**: 
   Patty's Plumbing charges a flat fee of $40 for visiting a house. This is a fixed cost that will be included in the total charge.

   \[
   \text{Service Charge} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Labor Charge**:
   The labor charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof. The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is based on whole hours or parts thereof, we need to round up 2.25 hours to the next whole hour, which is 3 hours.

   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 35 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 105 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Parts Cost**:
   The cost of parts used for the job is given as $60.

   \[
   \text{Parts Cost} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Charge**:
   Now, we can calculate the total charge by adding the service charge, labor charge, and parts cost together.

   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = \text{Service Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Parts Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = 205 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount that Patty charged for the job is **$205**. 

Final answer: **$205**.
