To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spends 6 hours boating.
   - He spends half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Swimming time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate total time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - Total time for boating and swimming is:
     \[
     \text{Total boating and swimming time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total show time} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate total time spent on activities:**
   - The total time spent on activities (boating, swimming, and watching shows) is:
     \[
     \text{Total activity time} = 9 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Determine total vacation time based on the percentage of time spent:**
   - We know that the time spent on activities (15 hours) is 30% of the total time John spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate time spent sightseeing:**
   - John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is:
\[
\boxed{20 \text{ hours}}
\]
