To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of books and the current unsold books**:
   - Total books: 250
   - Unsold books: 50
   - Therefore, the number of sold books so far is:
     \[
     \text{Sold books} = \text{Total books} - \text{Unsold books} = 250 - 50 = 200
     \]

2. **Determine the number of books sold this year**:
   - Books sold this year: 45

3. **Calculate the number of books sold in previous years**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (this year), which we know is 45.
   - According to the problem, Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in the first year} = 2x = 2 \times 45 = 90
     \]
   - Let \( y \) be the number of books sold in the second year. We can now express the total number of books sold over the three years as:
     \[
     \text{Total sold} = \text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the second year} + \text{Books sold this year}
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     200 = 90 + y + 45
     \]

4. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   \[
   200 = 90 + y + 45
   \]
   \[
   200 = 135 + y
   \]
   \[
   y = 200 - 135 = 65
   \]
   So, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

5. **Calculate the total earnings from the second year**:
   - Each book sells for $20. Therefore, the total earnings from the second year can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second year} = \text{Books sold in second year} \times \text{Price per book}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second year} = 65 \times 20 = 1300
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is \(\boxed{1300}\).
