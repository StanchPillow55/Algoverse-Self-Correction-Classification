To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of letters delivered each day from Monday to Wednesday step by step.

1. **Monday's Deliveries**:
   - The post office delivered **425 letters** on Monday.

2. **Tuesday's Deliveries**:
   - On Tuesday, the post office delivered **17 more than one-fifth** of Monday's deliveries.
   - First, we calculate one-fifth of Monday's deliveries:
     \[
     \text{One-fifth of Monday's deliveries} = \frac{425}{5} = 85
     \]
   - Now, we add 17 to this amount to find Tuesday's deliveries:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday's deliveries} = 85 + 17 = 102
     \]

3. **Wednesday's Deliveries**:
   - On Wednesday, the post office delivered **5 more than twice** the number of letters delivered on Tuesday.
   - First, we calculate twice Tuesday's deliveries:
     \[
     \text{Twice Tuesday's deliveries} = 2 \times 102 = 204
     \]
   - Now, we add 5 to this amount to find Wednesday's deliveries:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday's deliveries} = 204 + 5 = 209
     \]

4. **Total Deliveries from Monday to Wednesday**:
   - Now we will sum the deliveries from all three days:
     \[
     \text{Total deliveries} = \text{Monday's deliveries} + \text{Tuesday's deliveries} + \text{Wednesday's deliveries}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total deliveries} = 425 + 102 + 209
     \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
     \[
     425 + 102 = 527
     \]
     \[
     527 + 209 = 736
     \]

Thus, the total number of letters delivered by the post office from Monday to Wednesday is **736**.

**Final Answer**: 736 letters.
