To find the total cost of James's wardrobe, we will break down the costs of each item he purchased: suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits
James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.

\[
\text{Cost of suits} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Cost per suit}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants
The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits. Since each suit costs $750, we can calculate the cost of one dress pant as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of one dress pant} = \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150
\]

Now, James buys 10 dress pants, so we calculate the total cost of the dress pants:

\[
\text{Cost of dress pants} = \text{Number of dress pants} \times \text{Cost per dress pant}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts
James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he has 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts he buys is:

\[
\text{Total dress shirts} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Shirts per suit}
\]
\[
\text{Total dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Each dress shirt costs $60, so we calculate the total cost of the dress shirts:

\[
\text{Cost of dress shirts} = \text{Total dress shirts} \times \text{Cost per dress shirt}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the wardrobe
Now we can sum up the costs of all items to find the total cost of the wardrobe:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10800
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of James's wardrobe is **$10,800**.
