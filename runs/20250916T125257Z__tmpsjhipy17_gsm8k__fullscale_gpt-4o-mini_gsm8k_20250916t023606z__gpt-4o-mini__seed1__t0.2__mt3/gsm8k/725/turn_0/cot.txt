To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, and then calculate the average time taken by both.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken by the cat

The problem states that the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time taken by the cat is:

\[
\text{Time taken by cat} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the dog

The dog can eat the same number of sausages (nine sausages) in \( \frac{2}{3} \) the amount of time the cat takes. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, we calculate the time for the dog as follows:

\[
\text{Time taken by dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time taken by dog} = \frac{2 \times 30}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average time taken by the two

Now that we have the time taken by both the cat and the dog, we can find the average time. The average time is calculated by adding the times taken by both and dividing by 2:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time taken by cat} + \text{Time taken by dog}}{2}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

The average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25 \text{ minutes}}
\]
