To find out how many points Amy scores on her history test, we will calculate the points she earns from each type of question separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate points from multiple-choice questions

- **Total multiple-choice questions**: 10
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (MC)} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
\]

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Points from MC} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate points from true/false questions

- **Total true/false questions**: 20
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 90%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (TF)} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
\]

Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Points from TF} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate points from long-answer questions

- **Total long-answer questions**: 5
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 60%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (LA)} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
\]

Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Points from LA} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Sum all points

Now, we add the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Points from MC} + \text{Points from TF} + \text{Points from LA}
\]
\[
\text{Total points} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
