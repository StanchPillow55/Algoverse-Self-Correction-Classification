To determine Amy's total score on her history test, we will break down the problem into several steps, calculating her scores for each type of question separately and then summing them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the score from multiple-choice questions

1. **Total multiple-choice questions**: 10
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 80%
3. **Number of correct answers**: 
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 1 point
5. **Total points from multiple-choice questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from multiple-choice} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the score from true/false questions

1. **Total true/false questions**: 20
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 90%
3. **Number of correct answers**:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 1 point
5. **Total points from true/false questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from true/false} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the score from long-answer questions

1. **Total long-answer questions**: 5
2. **Percentage answered correctly**: 60%
3. **Number of correct answers**:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
   \]
4. **Points per correct answer**: 5 points
5. **Total points from long-answer questions**:
   \[
   \text{Points from long-answer} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total score

Now, we will sum the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total score} = \text{Points from multiple-choice} + \text{Points from true/false} + \text{Points from long-answer}
\]
\[
\text{Total score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
