To determine Amy's total score on her history test, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question based on the percentages of correct answers she provided. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Points from Multiple-Choice Questions

1. **Total Multiple-Choice Questions**: 10
2. **Percentage Correct**: 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = \text{Total Questions} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Correct}}{100}\right)
\]
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 10 \times \left(\frac{80}{100}\right) = 10 \times 0.8 = 8
\]

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Points from Multiple-Choice} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 1 = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Points from True/False Questions

1. **Total True/False Questions**: 20
2. **Percentage Correct**: 90%

Using the same formula:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 20 \times \left(\frac{90}{100}\right) = 20 \times 0.9 = 18
\]

Each true/false question is also worth 1 point, so the total points from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Points from True/False} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 1 = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Points from Long-Answer Questions

1. **Total Long-Answer Questions**: 5
2. **Percentage Correct**: 60%

Again, applying the formula:
\[
\text{Correct Answers} = 5 \times \left(\frac{60}{100}\right) = 5 \times 0.6 = 3
\]

Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so the total points from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Points from Long-Answer} = \text{Correct Answers} \times 5 = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Score

Now we sum the points from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total Score} = \text{Points from Multiple-Choice} + \text{Points from True/False} + \text{Points from Long-Answer}
\]
\[
\text{Total Score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
