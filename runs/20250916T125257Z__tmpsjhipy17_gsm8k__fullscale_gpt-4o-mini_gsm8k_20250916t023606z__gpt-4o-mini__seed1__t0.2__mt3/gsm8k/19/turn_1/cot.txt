To find the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required for the entire hike at the desired average speed:**
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
   \]
   Rearranging this gives us:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine the time Marissa has already spent hiking:**
   - Time for the first 4 miles: 1 hour
   - Time for the next 2 miles: 1 hour
   - Total time spent so far:
   \[
   \text{Total time spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining time she has to complete the hike:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total time} - \text{Total time spent} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining distance to be hiked:**
   - Total distance: 12 miles
   - Distance already hiked: 4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles
   - Remaining distance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed needed to cover the remaining distance in the remaining time:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Remaining time}} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

Thus, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** to achieve her goal of an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.

**Final Answer: 6 miles per hour**
