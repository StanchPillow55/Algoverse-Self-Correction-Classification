To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining distance of the trail to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Time Required for Average Speed

First, we need to find out how much total time Marissa needs to complete the 12-mile trail at an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The formula for average speed is:

\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Rearranging this formula to find the total time gives us:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Average Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Time Already Spent

Next, we need to calculate how much time Marissa has already spent hiking the first 6 miles of the trail.

- For the first 4 miles, she took 1 hour.
- For the next 2 miles, she took another hour.

So, the total time spent so far is:

\[
\text{Time Spent} = 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining Time

Now, we can find out how much time Marissa has left to complete the hike in order to meet her average speed goal.

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Time} - \text{Time Spent}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = 3 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Remaining Distance

Marissa has already walked 6 miles (4 miles + 2 miles), so the remaining distance to hike is:

\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Required Speed for Remaining Distance

Now we need to find the speed at which Marissa must walk the remaining 6 miles in the remaining 1 hour. We can use the formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Substituting the remaining distance and remaining time:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

### Final Answer

Marissa needs to walk at a speed of **6 miles per hour** for the remaining distance to achieve her average speed goal of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike.
