To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we will first calculate the total amount of sugar required for each type of candy separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch} = 8 \times 30
   \]

   \[
   \text{Sugar for suckers} = 240 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch} = 1 \times 70
   \]

   \[
   \text{Sugar for fudge} = 70 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sugar needed:**
   - Now, we will add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge to find the total amount of sugar required.

   \[
   \text{Total sugar} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge} = 240 + 70
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total sugar} = 310 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, Mason needs a total of **310 ounces of sugar** to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Final answer: **310 ounces**
