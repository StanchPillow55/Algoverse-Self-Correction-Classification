To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for the suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - For 8 batches, the total sugar needed is:
     \[
     30 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 8 \text{ batches} = 240 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for the fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - For 1 batch, the total sugar needed is:
     \[
     70 \text{ ounces/batch} \times 1 \text{ batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Add the sugar needed for both the suckers and the fudge:**
   - Total sugar needed is:
     \[
     240 \text{ ounces (suckers)} + 70 \text{ ounces (fudge)} = 310 \text{ ounces}
     \]

Thus, Mason needs a total of **310 ounces of sugar** to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Final answer: **310 ounces**.
