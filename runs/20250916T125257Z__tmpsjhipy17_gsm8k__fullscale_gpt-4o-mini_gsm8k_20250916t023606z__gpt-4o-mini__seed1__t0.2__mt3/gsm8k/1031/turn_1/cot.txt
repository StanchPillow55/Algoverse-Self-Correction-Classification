To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to distribute to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for guests**: 
   The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to subtract the seats that are already allocated for graduates and faculty.

   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

   Total seats occupied by graduates and faculty:
   \[
   950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

   Now, we subtract this from the total capacity:
   \[
   6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

   So, there are 4750 seats available for guests.

2. **Determine the number of graduates**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates, but we can denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

3. **Calculate the number of tickets per graduate**: 
   If the available seats (4750) are to be split equally among the graduates, we can find the number of tickets each graduate receives by dividing the total number of available guest seats by the number of graduates.

   The formula for the number of tickets per graduate is:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since we do not have a specific number for \( G \) (the number of graduates), we cannot compute a numerical answer. However, the formula \( \frac{4750}{G} \) gives us the number of tickets each graduate can distribute based on the total number of graduates.

If we assume a hypothetical number of graduates, we could calculate a specific answer. For example, if there were 950 graduates, each graduate would receive:
\[
\frac{4750}{950} = 5
\]
Thus, each graduate would receive 5 tickets.

In conclusion, the number of tickets each graduate receives is given by the formula \( \frac{4750}{G} \), where \( G \) is the number of graduates. Without knowing \( G \), we cannot provide a specific numerical answer.
