To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for guests**: 
   The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to subtract the seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

   Total seats reserved for graduates and faculty:
   \[
   950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

   Now, we subtract this from the total capacity:
   \[
   6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

   So, there are 4750 seats available for guests.

2. **Determine the number of graduates**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates, so we will denote the number of graduates as \( G \).

3. **Calculate the number of tickets each graduate receives**:
   If the available seats (4750) are to be split equally among the graduates, each graduate will receive a certain number of tickets. The number of tickets per graduate can be calculated by dividing the total number of guest seats by the number of graduates:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since we do not have a specific number for \( G \) (the number of graduates), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the formula for the number of tickets each graduate receives is:
   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{4750}{G}
   \]

To summarize, the number of tickets each graduate receives depends on the total number of graduates. If you provide the number of graduates, we can calculate the exact number of tickets each graduate would receive.
