To find the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens he has at the end of that period.

### Step 1: Initial Count of Animals
- Initial number of cows: 50
- Initial number of chickens: 20

### Step 2: Daily Increase in Animals
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

### Step 3: Duration of Increase
The increase happens over a period of three weeks. We need to convert weeks into days:
- 1 week = 7 days
- 3 weeks = 3 Ã— 7 = 21 days

### Step 4: Total Increase in Cows
The total number of cows brought in over 21 days can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total cows added} = \text{cows per day} \times \text{number of days} = 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
\]

### Step 5: Total Increase in Chickens
The total number of chickens brought in over 21 days can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total chickens added} = \text{chickens per day} \times \text{number of days} = 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}
\]

### Step 6: Final Count of Animals
Now we can calculate the final number of cows and chickens on the farm.

**Final number of cows:**
\[
\text{Final cows} = \text{initial cows} + \text{total cows added} = 50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows}
\]

**Final number of chickens:**
\[
\text{Final chickens} = \text{initial chickens} + \text{total chickens added} = 20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens}
\]

### Step 7: Total Number of Animals
Now, we add the final counts of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm:
\[
\text{Total animals} = \text{Final cows} + \text{Final chickens} = 470 + 230 = 700
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is **700**.
