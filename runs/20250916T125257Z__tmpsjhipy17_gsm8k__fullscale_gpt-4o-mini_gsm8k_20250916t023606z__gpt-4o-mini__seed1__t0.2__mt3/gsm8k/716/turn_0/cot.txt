To find the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories contributed by the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs
John uses 6 eggs, and each egg has 75 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = \text{Number of eggs} \times \text{Calories per egg}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese
John uses 2 ounces of cheese, and each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = \text{Number of ounces of cheese} \times \text{Calories per ounce of cheese}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham
John also uses 2 ounces of ham, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories.

\[
\text{Calories from ham} = \text{Number of ounces of ham} \times \text{Calories per ounce of ham}
\]
\[
\text{Calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 4: Sum all the calories
Now we add the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham together to find the total calories in the omelet.

\[
\text{Total calories} = \text{Calories from eggs} + \text{Calories from cheese} + \text{Calories from ham}
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 450 + 240 + 80
\]
\[
\text{Total calories} = 770 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.
