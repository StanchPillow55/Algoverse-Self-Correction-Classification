To find the total calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate calories from the eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
   \[
   \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \times 75 = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate calories from the cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Cheese has 120 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from cheese = Amount of cheese (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from cheese} = 2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate calories from the ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham (equal amount to cheese).
   - Ham has 40 calories per ounce.
   - Total calories from ham = Amount of ham (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from ham} = 2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Sum all the calories:**
   - Total calories in the omelet = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**.
