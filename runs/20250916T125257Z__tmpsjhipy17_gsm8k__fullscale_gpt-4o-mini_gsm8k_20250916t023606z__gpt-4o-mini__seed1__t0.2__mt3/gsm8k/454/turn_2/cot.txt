To solve the problem of how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Daily Consumption**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate Total Daily Consumption**:
   - To find out how many apples they eat together in one day, we add their daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Marin's apples} + \text{Nancy's apples} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

3. **Calculate Total Consumption Over 30 Days**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many apples they eat together over 30 days. We multiply their total daily consumption by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 30 days} = \text{Total daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication**:
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     8 \times 30 = 240
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of apples that Marin and Nancy eat together in 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{240}
     \]
