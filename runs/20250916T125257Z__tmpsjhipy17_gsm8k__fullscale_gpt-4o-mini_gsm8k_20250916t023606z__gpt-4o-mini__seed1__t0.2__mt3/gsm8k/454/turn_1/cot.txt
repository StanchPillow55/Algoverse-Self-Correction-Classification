To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together in 30 days.

1. **Identify the daily apple consumption for each person**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples per day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples per day.

2. **Calculate the total daily apple consumption for both Marin and Nancy**:
   - Total apples eaten per day = Marin's apples + Nancy's apples
   - Total apples eaten per day = 4 apples (Marin) + 4 apples (Nancy) = 8 apples.

3. **Determine the total apple consumption over 30 days**:
   - To find the total apples eaten in 30 days, we multiply the total daily consumption by the number of days:
   - Total apples in 30 days = Total apples per day × Number of days
   - Total apples in 30 days = 8 apples/day × 30 days.

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - Total apples in 30 days = 8 × 30 = 240 apples.

Thus, Marin and Nancy together eat a total of **240 apples** in 30 days.

**Final Answer**: 240 apples.
