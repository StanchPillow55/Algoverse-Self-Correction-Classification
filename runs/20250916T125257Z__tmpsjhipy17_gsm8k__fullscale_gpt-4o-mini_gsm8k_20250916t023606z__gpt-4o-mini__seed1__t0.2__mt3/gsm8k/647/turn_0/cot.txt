To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes him to dig through both the soil and the clay separately, and then sum those times.

1. **Calculate the time to dig through the soil:**
   - Bill digs through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour.
   - He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.
   - We can use the formula for time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values for soil:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to dig through the clay:**
   - Bill digs through clay at half the speed of soil, which is:
     \[
     \text{Rate}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour}
     \]
   - He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay.
   - Using the same formula for time:
     \[
     \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Now we add the time taken to dig through the soil and the clay:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} + \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Bill to dig the well is **10 hours**. 

Final answer: **10 hours**.
