To determine how much money John is missing for the school trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the trip**: The problem states that the trip costs $300.

2. **Determine the amount the school will cover**: The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cost of the trip}
   \]
   Substituting the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150
   \]

3. **Calculate how much John needs to contribute**: Since the school is covering $150, we need to find out how much John needs to pay. This is the other half of the trip cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount John needs to pay} = \text{Total cost of the trip} - \text{Amount covered by the school}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Amount John needs to pay} = 300 - 150 = 150
   \]

4. **Determine how much money John currently has**: The problem states that John has $50.

5. **Calculate how much money John is missing**: To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he currently has from the amount he needs to pay:
   \[
   \text{Amount John is missing} = \text{Amount John needs to pay} - \text{Amount John has}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Amount John is missing} = 150 - 50 = 100
   \]

Thus, John is missing **$100** to cover his share of the trip cost.

Final answer: John is missing $100.
