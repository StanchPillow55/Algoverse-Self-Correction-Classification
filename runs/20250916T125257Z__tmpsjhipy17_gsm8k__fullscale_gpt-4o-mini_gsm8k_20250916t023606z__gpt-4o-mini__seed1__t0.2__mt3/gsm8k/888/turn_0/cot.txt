To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Lani has after eating some.**
2. **Divide the remaining cookies equally into the jars.**
3. **Calculate the number of cookies in each jar.**

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Cookies

Lani baked a total of 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies are left after she ate some, we subtract the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked:

\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = 55 - 5 = 50
\]

### Step 2: Divide Remaining Cookies into Jars

Lani places the remaining cookies into 5 jars equally. To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we need to divide the remaining cookies by the number of jars:

\[
\text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{\text{Remaining cookies}}{\text{Number of jars}}
\]
\[
\text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{50}{5}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Cookies in Each Jar

Now we perform the division:

\[
\text{Cookies per jar} = 10
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of cookies in each jar is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
