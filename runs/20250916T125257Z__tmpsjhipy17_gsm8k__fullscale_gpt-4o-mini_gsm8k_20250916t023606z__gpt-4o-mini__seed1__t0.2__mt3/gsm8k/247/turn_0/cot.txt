To determine how much each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total amount spent by Isabelle on all the items. We will then divide that total by the number of people sharing the cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of party supplies.**

Isabelle's expenses are as follows:
- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

Now, we will add these amounts together:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22
\]

Calculating this step by step:

1. \(12 + 43 = 55\)
2. \(55 + 15 = 70\)
3. \(70 + 4 = 74\)
4. \(74 + 22 = 96\)

So, the total cost of the party supplies is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 96 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Split the total cost evenly among three people.**

Isabelle is splitting the total cost with her two parents, which means the total cost will be divided by 3.

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{3} = \frac{96}{3}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
96 \div 3 = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each person paid \(32\) dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
