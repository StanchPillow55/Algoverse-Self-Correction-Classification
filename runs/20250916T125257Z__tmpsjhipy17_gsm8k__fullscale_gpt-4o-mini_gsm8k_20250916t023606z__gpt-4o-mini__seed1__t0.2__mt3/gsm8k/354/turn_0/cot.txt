To determine how much money Annabelle still needs to save for the phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Annabelle currently has in savings.**
   - She already has $80 in her savings.

2. **Calculate her earnings from her first job.**
   - Annabelle earns $10 per hour at her first job and works for 20 hours.
   - Earnings from the first job = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from first job} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate her earnings from her second job.**
   - Annabelle earns $5 per hour at her second job and works for 15 hours.
   - Earnings from the second job = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Earnings from second job} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate her total earnings from both jobs.**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from first job + Earnings from second job
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate Annabelle's total savings.**
   - Total savings = Current savings + Total earnings
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save.**
   - The cost of the phone is $400.
   - Amount still needed = Cost of phone - Total savings
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.

Final answer: **$45**
