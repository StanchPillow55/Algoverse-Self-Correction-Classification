To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Annabelle's total earnings from her jobs.**

   - From her first job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from first job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 20 \, \text{hours} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

   - From her second job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from second job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked} = 5 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Add the earnings from both jobs to find her total earnings.**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from first job} + \text{Earnings from second job} = 200 \, \text{dollars} + 75 \, \text{dollars} = 275 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Annabelle's total savings.**
   - She already has $80 in savings, so:
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Current savings} + \text{Total earnings} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 275 \, \text{dollars} = 355 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much more money she needs to save to buy the phone.**
   - The cost of the phone is $400, so:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of phone} - \text{Total savings} = 400 \, \text{dollars} - 355 \, \text{dollars} = 45 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.

**Final Answer: $45**
