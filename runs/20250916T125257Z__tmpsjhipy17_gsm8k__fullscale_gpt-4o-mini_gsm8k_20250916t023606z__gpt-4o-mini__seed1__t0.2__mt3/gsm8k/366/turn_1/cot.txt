To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to be promoted to the next school year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total points needed**: Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined.

2. **Calculate the points Jane has already scored**:
   - On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
   - On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.
   
   We can calculate her total score from the first two tests:
   \[
   \text{Total score from first two tests} = 15 + 18 = 33 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Determine the points needed from the third test**:
   To find out how many points Jane needs on the third test, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Total score from all tests} = \text{Score on Test 1} + \text{Score on Test 2} + \text{Score on Test 3}
   \]
   We know that:
   \[
   \text{Score on Test 1} = 15, \quad \text{Score on Test 2} = 18, \quad \text{Score on Test 3} = x
   \]
   Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   15 + 18 + x \geq 42
   \]

4. **Simplify the inequality**:
   Combine the scores from the first two tests:
   \[
   33 + x \geq 42
   \]

5. **Isolate \(x\)**:
   To find \(x\), we subtract 33 from both sides of the inequality:
   \[
   x \geq 42 - 33
   \]
   \[
   x \geq 9
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to meet the requirement of a total of at least 42 points.

Thus, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is **9 points**.
