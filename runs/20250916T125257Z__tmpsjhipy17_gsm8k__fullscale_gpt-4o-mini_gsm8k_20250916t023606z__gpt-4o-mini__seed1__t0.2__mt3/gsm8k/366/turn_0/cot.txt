To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to be promoted to the next school year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total points needed**: Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined.

2. **Calculate the points Jane has already scored**: 
   - On the first test, Jane scored 15 points.
   - On the second test, Jane scored 18 points.
   
   We can calculate the total points she has scored so far:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = \text{Points from Test 1} + \text{Points from Test 2} = 15 + 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points scored} = 33
   \]

3. **Determine the points needed from the third test**: 
   To find out how many points Jane needs on the third test, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total points needed} = \text{Points scored on Test 1} + \text{Points scored on Test 2} + \text{Points scored on Test 3}
   \]
   We know that the total points needed is at least 42, so we can express this as:
   \[
   33 + \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 42
   \]

4. **Solve for the points needed on the third test**:
   To find the minimum score Jane needs on the third test, we can rearrange the inequality:
   \[
   \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 42 - 33
   \]
   \[
   \text{Points scored on Test 3} \geq 9
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to pass is 9 points.

Final answer: **9 points**.
