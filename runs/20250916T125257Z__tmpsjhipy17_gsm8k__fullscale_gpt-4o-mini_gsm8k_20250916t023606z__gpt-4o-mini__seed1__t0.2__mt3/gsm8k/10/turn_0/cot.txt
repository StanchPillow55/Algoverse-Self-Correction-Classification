To solve the problem, we will break it down into three parts: calculating the downloads for each month and then summing them up.

1. **Downloads in the First Month:**
   The problem states that there were 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 60
   \]

2. **Downloads in the Second Month:**
   The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 2} = 3 \times \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Downloads in the Third Month:**
   The downloads in the third month are reduced by 30% from the second month's downloads. First, we need to find 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Now, we subtract this reduction from the second month's downloads to find the total downloads in the third month:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 3} = \text{Downloads in Month 2} - 30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Now, we sum the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{Downloads in Month 1} + \text{Downloads in Month 2} + \text{Downloads in Month 3}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   60 + 180 = 240
   \]
   \[
   240 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]
