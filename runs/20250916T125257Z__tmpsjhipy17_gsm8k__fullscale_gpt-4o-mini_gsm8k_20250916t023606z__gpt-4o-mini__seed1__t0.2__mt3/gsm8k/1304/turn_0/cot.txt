To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the average enrollment at Norman High School.**
   - According to the problem, Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students each year.
   \[
   \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} = 4000
   \]

2. **Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School.**
   - The problem states that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.
   - To find the enrollment at Butler High School, we multiply the enrollment at Norman High School by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
   \[
   \text{Enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{3 \times 4000}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
   \]
   So, the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students.

3. **Calculate the difference in enrollment between the two schools.**
   - To find out how much greater the enrollment at Norman High School is than at Butler High School, we subtract the enrollment at Butler from the enrollment at Norman:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Enrollment at Butler High School}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the average enrollment at Butler High School.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
