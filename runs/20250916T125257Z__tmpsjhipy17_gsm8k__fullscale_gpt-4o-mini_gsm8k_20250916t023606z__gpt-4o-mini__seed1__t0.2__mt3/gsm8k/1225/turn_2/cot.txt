Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Carly makes brownies and cupcakes.
   - The number of brownies she makes is described as "2 less than three times as many cupcakes."
   - There are 5 people in the class, and each person gets 2 treats. Therefore, the total number of treats needed is \(5 \times 2 = 10\).

2. **Setting Up the Equations**:
   - Let \(c\) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - According to the problem, the number of brownies \(b\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]
   - The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

3. **Substituting the Expression for Brownies**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \(b\) into the total treats equation:
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]

5. **Solving for \(c\)**:
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

6. **Finding the Number of Brownies**:
   - Now that we have \(c\), we can find \(b\):
     \[
     b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
     \]

7. **Verifying the Total**:
   - Check if the total number of treats equals 10:
     \[
     c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
     \]
   - This is correct.

8. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of cupcakes Carly made is \( \boxed{3} \).
