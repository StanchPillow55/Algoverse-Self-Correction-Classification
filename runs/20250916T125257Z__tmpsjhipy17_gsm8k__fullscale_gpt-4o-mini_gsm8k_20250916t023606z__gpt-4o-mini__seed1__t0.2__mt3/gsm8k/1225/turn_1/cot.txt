To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cupcakes Carly made based on the information provided about the number of treats and the relationship between the number of brownies and cupcakes.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Carly's class has 5 people.
   - Each person gets 2 treats.
   - Therefore, the total number of treats needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total treats} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Treats per person} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ treats}
     \]

2. **Setting up the relationship between cupcakes and brownies**:
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of cupcakes Carly makes.
   - According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     b = 3c - 2
     \]
   where \( b \) is the number of brownies.

3. **Total treats equation**:
   - The total number of treats (cupcakes + brownies) must equal 10:
     \[
     c + b = 10
     \]

4. **Substituting the expression for brownies**:
   - We can substitute \( b \) from the previous equation into the total treats equation:
     \[
     c + (3c - 2) = 10
     \]

5. **Simplifying the equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     c + 3c - 2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     4c - 2 = 10
     \]

6. **Solving for \( c \)**:
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     4c = 12
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]

7. **Finding the number of brownies**:
   - Now that we know \( c = 3 \), we can find \( b \):
     \[
     b = 3c - 2 = 3(3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
     \]

8. **Verifying the total treats**:
   - Check if the total number of treats equals 10:
     \[
     c + b = 3 + 7 = 10
     \]
   - This confirms our calculations are correct.

9. **Final answer**:
   - The number of cupcakes Carly made is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]
