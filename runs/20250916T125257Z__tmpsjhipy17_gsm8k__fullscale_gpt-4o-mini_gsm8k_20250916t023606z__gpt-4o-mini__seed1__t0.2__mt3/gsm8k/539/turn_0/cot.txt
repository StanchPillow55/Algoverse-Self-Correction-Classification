To determine how much you ended up paying for the dinner bill, we can break the problem down into a few steps.

1. **Calculate the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. To find the tip amount, we can use the formula for calculating a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]
   Here, the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20). Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount you will pay**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find out how much you will pay in total:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine how much each person pays**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we can find out how much each person pays by dividing the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Amount Each Pays} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Paid}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: Since you are paying the total amount of $60, we can summarize that you will pay the entire bill plus the tip.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Answer} = 60
\]

In conclusion, you ended up paying a total of **$60** for the dinner, which includes the $50 bill and a $10 tip.
