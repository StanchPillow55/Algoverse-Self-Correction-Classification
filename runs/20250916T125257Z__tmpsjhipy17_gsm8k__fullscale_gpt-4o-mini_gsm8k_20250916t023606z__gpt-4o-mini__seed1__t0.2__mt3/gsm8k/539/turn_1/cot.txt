To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, we can use the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.2 \times 50 = 10
   \]
   So, the tip amounts to $10.

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount that needs to be paid:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Split the total amount**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we divide the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Split Amount} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine how much you pay**: You are responsible for paying the entire dinner bill plus the additional tip. Therefore, you will pay the total amount of $60.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Amount Paid} = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
