To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps. 

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. To find 20% of $50, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]
   Here, the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20). Thus:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount that will be paid:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Split the total amount**: Since the check is to be split evenly between you and your wife, we divide the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Amount Each Pays} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine your total payment**: However, since you are paying the entire bill plus the tip, you will pay the total amount of $60.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
