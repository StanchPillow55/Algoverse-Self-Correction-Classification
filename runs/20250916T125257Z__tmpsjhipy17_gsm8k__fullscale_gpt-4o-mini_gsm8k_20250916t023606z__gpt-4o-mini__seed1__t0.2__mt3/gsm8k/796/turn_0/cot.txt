To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary paid to all employees during that time.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of new employees hired over three months.

The company hires 20 new employees every month. Therefore, over three months, the total number of new employees hired is:

\[
\text{New employees hired} = 20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.

The initial number of employees is 200. After hiring 60 new employees, the total number of employees becomes:

\[
\text{Total employees after 3 months} = \text{Initial employees} + \text{New employees hired}
\]
\[
\text{Total employees after 3 months} = 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total salary paid to all employees for three months.

Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month. Therefore, the total salary paid to all employees in one month is:

\[
\text{Total salary for one month} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for one month} = 260 \text{ employees} \times 4000 \text{ dollars/employee} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary paid over three months.

To find the total salary paid over three months, we multiply the monthly salary by 3:

\[
\text{Total salary for three months} = \text{Total salary for one month} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for three months} = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars} \times 3 = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:

\[
\boxed{3,120,000 \text{ dollars}}
\]
