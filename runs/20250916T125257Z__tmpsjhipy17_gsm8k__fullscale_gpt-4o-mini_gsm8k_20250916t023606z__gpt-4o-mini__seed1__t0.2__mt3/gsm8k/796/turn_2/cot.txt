To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Employee Count**: The company starts with 200 employees.

2. **Monthly Hiring Rate**: The company hires 20 new employees every month.

3. **Salary per Employee**: Each employee is paid a salary of $4000 per month.

4. **Time Frame**: We need to calculate the total salary paid after three months.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Employees After Three Months

- **Month 1**: 
  - Initial employees: 200
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 1: 
    \[
    200 + 20 = 220
    \]

- **Month 2**: 
  - Employees from Month 1: 220
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 2: 
    \[
    220 + 20 = 240
    \]

- **Month 3**: 
  - Employees from Month 2: 240
  - New hires: 20
  - Total employees at the end of Month 3: 
    \[
    240 + 20 = 260
    \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Salary Paid Each Month

- **Month 1**: 
  - Total employees: 220
  - Total salary for Month 1:
    \[
    220 \times 4000 = 880,000
    \]

- **Month 2**: 
  - Total employees: 240
  - Total salary for Month 2:
    \[
    240 \times 4000 = 960,000
    \]

- **Month 3**: 
  - Total employees: 260
  - Total salary for Month 3:
    \[
    260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
    \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Salary Paid Over Three Months

Now, we will sum the total salaries paid over the three months:

\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = \text{Month 1 salary} + \text{Month 2 salary} + \text{Month 3 salary}
\]
\[
= 880,000 + 960,000 + 1,040,000
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Add Month 1 and Month 2:
   \[
   880,000 + 960,000 = 1,840,000
   \]

2. Now add Month 3:
   \[
   1,840,000 + 1,040,000 = 2,880,000
   \]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[
\boxed{2,880,000}
\]
