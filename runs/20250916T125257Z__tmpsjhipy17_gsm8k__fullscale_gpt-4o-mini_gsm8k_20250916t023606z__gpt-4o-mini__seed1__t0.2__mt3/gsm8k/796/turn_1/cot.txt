To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, taking into account the initial number of employees and the number of new hires each month.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of employees and their salaries
- The company starts with **200 employees**.
- Each employee is paid **$4000** per month.

### Step 2: Calculate the total salary for the initial employees for one month
The total salary for the initial employees in one month can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total salary for initial employees} = \text{Number of initial employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for initial employees} = 200 \times 4000 = 800,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of new employees hired each month
The company hires **20 new employees** every month.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of employees at the end of each month
1. **End of Month 1**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Initial employees + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 1} = 200 + 20 = 220
   \]

2. **End of Month 2**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 1 + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 2} = 220 + 20 = 240
   \]

3. **End of Month 3**:
   - New hires: 20
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 2 + New hires
   \[
   \text{Total employees at end of Month 3} = 240 + 20 = 260
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total salary for each month
1. **Total salary for Month 1**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 1} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 1} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 1} = 220 \times 4000 = 880,000
   \]

2. **Total salary for Month 2**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 2} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 2} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 2} = 240 \times 4000 = 960,000
   \]

3. **Total salary for Month 3**:
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 3} = \text{Total employees at end of Month 3} \times \text{Salary per employee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total salary for Month 3} = 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
   \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total salary paid over the three months
Now, we sum the total salaries for each of the three months:
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = \text{Total salary for Month 1} + \text{Total salary for Month 2} + \text{Total salary for Month 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = 880,000 + 960,000 + 1,040,000
\]
\[
\text{Total salary for 3 months} = 2,880,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$2,880,000**.
