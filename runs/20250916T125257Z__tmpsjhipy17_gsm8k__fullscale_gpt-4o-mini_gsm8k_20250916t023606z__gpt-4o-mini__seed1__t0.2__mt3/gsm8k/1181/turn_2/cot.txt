To solve the problem, we will define variables for the ages of Wendy and Colin, set up equations based on the information given, and then solve those equations step by step.

Let:
- \( C \) = Colin's current age
- \( W \) = Wendy's current age

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the problem statements.

1. **First statement**: "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."
   - In seven years, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - According to the statement, Wendy's age \( W \) is five times that:
   \[
   W = 5(C + 7)
   \]

2. **Second statement**: "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - According to the statement, this age will be one third of Wendy's current age \( W \):
   \[
   C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
   \]

### Step 2: Rewrite the equations.

From the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

From the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the equation.

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 5: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \).

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
75 = 5C - 3C + 35
\]
\[
75 = 2C + 35
\]

Subtract 35 from both sides:
\[
75 - 35 = 2C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 6: Find Wendy's age using \( C \).

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

### Verification

1. **Check the first statement**:
   - In 7 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 7 = 27 \).
   - Wendy's age should be \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \). This is consistent with our calculation.

2. **Check the second statement**:
   - In 25 years, Colin will be \( 20 + 25 = 45 \).
   - One third of Wendy's current age \( 135 \) is \( \frac{135}{3} = 45 \). This is also consistent.

Both statements hold true, confirming that our solution is correct. Colin is indeed \( \boxed{20} \) years old.
