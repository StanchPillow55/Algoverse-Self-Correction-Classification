Let's denote Colin's current age as \( C \) and Wendy's current age as \( W \).

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

### Step 1: Set up the equations

From the first piece of information, we can express it mathematically:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:
  \[
  W = 5(C + 7)
  \]
  
From the second piece of information, we can express it as:
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age is \( W \).
- Thus, we have:
  \[
  C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
  \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

Now, simplify the right-hand side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Distributing both sides gives:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)

Now, rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]
\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]
Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 5: Find \( W \)

Now that we have Colin's current age, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

1. **Check the first condition**:
   - Colin's age in 7 years: \( 20 + 7 = 27 \)
   - Wendy's age: \( 135 \)
   - Check: \( 135 = 5 \times 27 \) (True)

2. **Check the second condition**:
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( 20 + 25 = 45 \)
   - Wendy's current age: \( 135 \)
   - Check: \( 45 = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \) (True)

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer

Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.
