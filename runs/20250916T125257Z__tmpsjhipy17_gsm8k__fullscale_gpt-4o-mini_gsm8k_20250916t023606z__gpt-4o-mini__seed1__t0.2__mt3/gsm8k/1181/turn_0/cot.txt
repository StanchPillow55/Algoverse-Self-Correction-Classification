Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We have two pieces of information from the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these statements into equations.

### Step 1: Set up the equations

From the first statement:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

From the second statement:
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age is \( W \).
- The equation from this statement is:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

We can substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

First, simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)

Rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 5: Find \( W \)

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Step 6: Verify the solution

1. Check the first condition:
   - Colin's age in 7 years: \( 20 + 7 = 27 \)
   - Wendy's age should be \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \), which matches our calculation.

2. Check the second condition:
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( 20 + 25 = 45 \)
   - Wendy's current age is \( 135 \).
   - One third of Wendy's age: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \), which matches.

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer

Colin is currently \( \boxed{20} \) years old.
