Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cats:**
   Larry has 3 cats. 
   \[
   \text{Cats} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the number of dogs:**
   Larry has 3 times as many dogs as cats. Therefore, the number of dogs can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Dogs} = 3 \times \text{Cats} = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

3. **Determine the number of rabbits:**
   Larry has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. Thus, the number of rabbits is:
   \[
   \text{Rabbits} = \text{Dogs} - 2 = 9 - 2 = 7
   \]

4. **Determine the number of fish:**
   Larry has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. Therefore, the number of fish is:
   \[
   \text{Fish} = 3 \times \text{Rabbits} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

5. **Determine the number of gerbils:**
   Larry has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. Thus, the number of gerbils is:
   \[
   \text{Gerbils} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   Now, we can sum up all the pets Larry has:
   \[
   \text{Total Pets} = \text{Cats} + \text{Dogs} + \text{Rabbits} + \text{Fish} + \text{Gerbils}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total Pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7
   \]

   Now, performing the addition step by step:
   \[
   3 + 9 = 12
   \]
   \[
   12 + 7 = 19
   \]
   \[
   19 + 21 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 + 7 = 47
   \]

Thus, the total number of pets Larry has is:
\[
\boxed{47}
\]
