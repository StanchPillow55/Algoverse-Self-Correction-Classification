To determine how much candy each person would have after pooling and sharing their candy equally, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of candy**: 
   We need to add the amounts of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have.

   - Robert has 3 pounds of candy.
   - Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.
   - Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.

   We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Total candy} = \text{Robert's candy} + \text{Cindy's candy} + \text{Aaron's candy}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total candy} = 3 + 5 + 4
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 4 = 12
   \]
   So, the total amount of candy is 12 pounds.

2. **Determine how many people are sharing the candy**: 
   There are three people sharing the candy: Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.

3. **Calculate the amount of candy each person would receive**: 
   To find out how much candy each person would get, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it.

   We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = \frac{\text{Total candy}}{\text{Number of people}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = \frac{12}{3}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   Each person will receive 4 pounds of candy after pooling and sharing.

Thus, the final answer is that each of them would have **4 pounds of candy**.
