To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the total number of fruit from the clusters and then add the number of individual fruit.

1. **Calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters:**
   - There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruit.
   - To find the total number of fruit in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruit in each cluster:

   \[
   \text{Total fruit in clusters} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruit per cluster}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fruit in clusters} = 6 \times 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fruit in clusters} = 120
   \]

2. **Add the number of individual fruit:**
   - We know there are 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.
   - To find the total number of raspberries, we add the total fruit from the clusters to the number of individual fruit:

   \[
   \text{Total raspberries} = \text{Total fruit in clusters} + \text{Individual fruit}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total raspberries} = 120 + 67
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total raspberries} = 187
   \]

Thus, the total number of raspberries on the bush is \( \boxed{187} \).
