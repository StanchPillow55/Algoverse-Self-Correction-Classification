To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of history teachers**:
   - We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers.
   - To find the number of history teachers, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of math teachers**:
   - The rest of the teachers are math teachers. Therefore, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:
     \[
     \text{Number of math teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Number of history teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sleeping time for math teachers**:
   - Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total sleeping time for all math teachers, we multiply the number of math teachers by the hours each sleeps:
     \[
     \text{Total sleeping time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Hours slept per teacher} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is **360 hours**. 

Final answer: **360 hours**.
