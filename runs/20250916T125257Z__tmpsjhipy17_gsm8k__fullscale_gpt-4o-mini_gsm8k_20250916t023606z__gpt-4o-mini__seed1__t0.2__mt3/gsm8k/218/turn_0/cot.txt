Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify Harriet's current age**: 
   We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Calculate Adrian's current age**: 
   According to the problem, Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Therefore, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Calculate Zack's current age**: 
   The problem states that Harriet is half the age of Zack. We can express Zack's age in terms of Harriet's age:
   \[
   \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years**:
   - In three years, Harriet's age will be:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - In three years, Adrian's age will be:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - In three years, Zack's age will be:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years**:
   To find the average age, we sum the ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years and then divide by the number of people (which is 3):
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Adrian's age} + \text{Harriet's age} + \text{Zack's age}}{3}
   \]
   Plugging in the ages:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be:
   \[
   \boxed{45} \text{ years old}
   \]
