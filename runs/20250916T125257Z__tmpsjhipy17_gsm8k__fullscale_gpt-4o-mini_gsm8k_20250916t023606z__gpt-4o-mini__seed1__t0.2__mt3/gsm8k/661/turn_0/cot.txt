To determine the total cost of Roger's purchases, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we first calculate 20% of $5:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the original price to find the cost of the more expensive brand:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

2. **Determine how much coffee Roger needs for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he will need:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee:**
   - Now that we know the cost of the more expensive coffee is $6 per pound, we can calculate the total cost for 7 pounds:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the donut:**
   - Roger also buys a donut for $2. We need to add this cost to the total cost of the coffee:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total cost of everything Roger bought is:
     \[
     \boxed{44} \text{ dollars}
     \]
