To find out how much Roger spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee he bought and the cost of the donut.

1. **Calculate the cost of the normal brand of coffee:**
   - The normal brand costs $5 per pound.

2. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive brand:**
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find 20% of $5:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of coffee Roger needs for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day for 7 days:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee:**
   - The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

6. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - The total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
     \[
     42 \text{ dollars (coffee)} + 2 \text{ dollars (donut)} = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Roger spent is **$44**.
