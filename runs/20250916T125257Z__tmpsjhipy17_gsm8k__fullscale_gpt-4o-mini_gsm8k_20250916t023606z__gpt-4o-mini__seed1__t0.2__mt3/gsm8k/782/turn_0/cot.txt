To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
   - This means they ride their bikes 3 times each day for those 5 days.

   \[
   \text{Rides on usual days} = 3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
   \]

2. **Identify the riding frequency on the other days:**
   - On the other **2 days**, they ride **twice** the usual amount.
   - The usual amount is 3 rides per day, so twice that would be:

   \[
   \text{Rides on these days} = 2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
   \]

   - Therefore, for the 2 days, the total rides would be:

   \[
   \text{Rides on these 2 days} = 6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the other days:

   \[
   \text{Total rides in a week} = \text{Rides on usual days} + \text{Rides on other days}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total rides in a week} = 15 \text{ rides} + 12 \text{ rides} = 27 \text{ rides}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:

   \[
   \boxed{27}
   \]
