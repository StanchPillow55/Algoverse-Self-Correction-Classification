To solve the problem, we need to break down the riding schedule of Chase and Rider step by step.

1. **Determine the usual riding frequency:**
   - Chase and Rider ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days.
   - This means they ride:
     \[
     3 \text{ rides/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ rides}
     \]

2. **Determine the riding frequency on the two other days:**
   - On the two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days. Since they usually ride 3 times a day, on these two days they ride:
     \[
     2 \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 6 \text{ rides/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, for the two days, they ride:
     \[
     6 \text{ rides/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ rides}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total rides for the week:**
   - Now, we add the rides from the usual days and the rides from the two other days:
     \[
     15 \text{ rides (from usual days)} + 12 \text{ rides (from extra days)} = 27 \text{ rides}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{27}
     \]
