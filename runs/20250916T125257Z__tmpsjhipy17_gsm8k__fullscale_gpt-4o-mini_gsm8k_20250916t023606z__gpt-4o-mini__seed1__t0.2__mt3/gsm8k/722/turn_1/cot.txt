To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage to his car if he does not fix it.

1. **Cost of fixing the pothole**:
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt.
   - Each bucket costs $25.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the asphalt is:
     \[
     3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Fine for unauthorized road maintenance**:
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing the pothole himself.

3. **Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole**:
   - The total cost Ron incurs by fixing the pothole is the sum of the cost of the asphalt and the fine:
     \[
     75 \text{ dollars (asphalt)} + 120 \text{ dollars (fine)} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Potential damage to Ron's car**:
   - If Ron does not fix the pothole, it will cause $450 worth of damage to his car.

5. **Calculating the savings**:
   - To find out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the potential damage:
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars (damage)} - 195 \text{ dollars (cost to fix)} = 255 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves **$255**.

**Final Answer**: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.
