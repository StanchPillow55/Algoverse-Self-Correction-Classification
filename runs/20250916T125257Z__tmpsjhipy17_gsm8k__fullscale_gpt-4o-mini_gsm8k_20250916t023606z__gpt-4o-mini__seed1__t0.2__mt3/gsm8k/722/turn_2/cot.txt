To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage to his car if he does not fix it.

1. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 
     \[
     3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Fine for unauthorized road maintenance: 
     \[
     120 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost of fixing the pothole:
     \[
     75 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - Damage amount: 
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Potential damage - Total cost of fixing the pothole:
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars} - 195 \text{ dollars} = 255 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves **$255**.

Final answer: **$255**.
