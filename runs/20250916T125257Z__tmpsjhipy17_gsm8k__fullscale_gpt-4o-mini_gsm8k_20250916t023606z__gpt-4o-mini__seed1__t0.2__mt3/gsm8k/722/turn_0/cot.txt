To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage costs if he does not fix it.

1. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - **Cost of asphalt:** Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, and each bucket costs $25.
     \[
     \text{Cost of asphalt} = 3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - **Fine from the city council:** If Ron fixes the pothole himself, he will incur a fine of $120.
   - **Total cost of fixing the pothole:**
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of asphalt} + \text{Fine} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - The damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

3. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - To find out how much Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we subtract the total cost of fixing it from the potential damage cost.
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Potential damage} - \text{Total cost of fixing} = 450 \text{ dollars} - 195 \text{ dollars} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole himself, Ron saves **$255**.

**Final Answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.**
