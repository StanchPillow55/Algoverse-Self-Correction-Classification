To determine how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Vince was stapling reports.**
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a duration of:
     - 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

2. **Convert hours into minutes.**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 15 hours into minutes:
     \[
     15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

3. **Determine how many reports Vince can staple in one minute.**
   - Vince staples 30 reports in 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he can staple in one minute, we divide the number of reports by the number of minutes:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ reports}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 2 \text{ reports/minute}.
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled in 900 minutes.**
   - Now that we know Vince staples 2 reports per minute, we can find out how many reports he staples in 900 minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ reports/minute} \times 900 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ reports}.
     \]

5. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total number of reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM is:
     \[
     \boxed{1800}.
     \]
