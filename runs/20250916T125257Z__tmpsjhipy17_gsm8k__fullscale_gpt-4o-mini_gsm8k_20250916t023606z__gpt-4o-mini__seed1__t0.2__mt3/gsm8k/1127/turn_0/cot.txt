To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the average car**: 
   The problem states that the average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph).

2. **Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car**: 
   According to the problem, the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. 
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of average car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the average car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car**: 
   The problem states that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. 
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car}
   \]
   Substituting the speed of the 2nd fastest car:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

Thus, the speed of the fastest car is **750 miles per hour**.

**Final Answer**: 750 mph
