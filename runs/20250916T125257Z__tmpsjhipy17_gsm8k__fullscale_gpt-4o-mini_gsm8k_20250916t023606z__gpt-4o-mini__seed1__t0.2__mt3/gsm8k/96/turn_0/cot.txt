To determine how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify how many hours Harry slept**: 
   Harry slept 9 hours.

2. **Calculate how many hours James slept**: 
   James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours that is, we multiply Harry's sleep hours by \( \frac{2}{3} \).

   \[
   \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

   So, James slept 6 hours.

3. **Calculate how many more hours Harry slept than James**: 
   To find the difference in hours slept between Harry and James, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep} = 9 - 6
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]

4. **State the final answer**: 
   Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Harry slept 3 more hours than James.**
