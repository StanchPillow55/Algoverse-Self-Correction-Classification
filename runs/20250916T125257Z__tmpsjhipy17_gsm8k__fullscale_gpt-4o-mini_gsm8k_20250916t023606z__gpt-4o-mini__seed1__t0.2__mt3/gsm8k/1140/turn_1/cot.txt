To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Scoops Gomer ate} = 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
   \]

2. **Understand the relationship between potatoes and scoops:**
   We are told that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes. Let's calculate this step by step.

   - First, calculate how many potatoes are needed for 1 less than 3 scoops:
     \[
     1 \text{ less than 3} = 3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
     \]
   - Now, calculate how many potatoes are needed:
     \[
     3 \text{ less than 6} = 6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
     \]
   This means that 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 18 scoops:**
   We know that 3 potatoes make 2 scoops. To find out how many potatoes are needed for 18 scoops, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{18 \text{ scoops}}
   \]
   Cross-multiplying gives:
   \[
   3 \times 18 = 2 \times x
   \]
   \[
   54 = 2x
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Gomer ate a total of 27 potatoes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{27}
\]
