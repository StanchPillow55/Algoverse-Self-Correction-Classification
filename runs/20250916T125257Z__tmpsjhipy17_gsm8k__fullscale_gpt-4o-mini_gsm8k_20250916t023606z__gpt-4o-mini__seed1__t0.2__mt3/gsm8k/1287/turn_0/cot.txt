To find the total age of all the siblings in the family, we will first identify the ages of each sibling based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the ages of the sisters:**
   - There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total age of the sisters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \text{ sisters} \times 16 \text{ years/sister} = 48 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Identify the ages of the brothers:**
   - We know that one brother is 12 years old.
   - The problem states that this younger brother's age (12 years) is half the age of the older brother. We can denote the age of the older brother as \( x \).
   - According to the information given:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} x
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Thus, the older brother is 24 years old.

3. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**
   - Now we can find the total age of both brothers:
     \[
     \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 \text{ years (younger brother)} + 24 \text{ years (older brother)} = 36 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
   - Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to find the total age of all siblings:
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = \text{Total age of sisters} + \text{Total age of brothers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 \text{ years} + 36 \text{ years} = 84 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is \( \boxed{84} \) years.
