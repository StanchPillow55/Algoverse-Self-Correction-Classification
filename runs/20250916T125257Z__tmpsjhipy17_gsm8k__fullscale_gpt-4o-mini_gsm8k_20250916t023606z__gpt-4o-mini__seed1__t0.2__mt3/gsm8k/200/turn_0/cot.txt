To find out how many liters of water Baldur gets every day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pails of water Baldur collects each day.**
   - In the morning, Baldur collects 5 pails of water.
   - In the afternoon, he collects 6 pails of water.
   - To find the total number of pails collected in a day, we add the morning and afternoon pails together:
     \[
     \text{Total pails} = \text{Morning pails} + \text{Afternoon pails} = 5 + 6 = 11 \text{ pails}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total volume of water in liters.**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.
   - To find the total volume of water collected in liters, we multiply the total number of pails by the volume of water per pail:
     \[
     \text{Total liters} = \text{Total pails} \times \text{Liters per pail} = 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters/pail}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total liters} = 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ liters}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Baldur collects a total of 55 liters of water every day.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{55} \text{ liters}
\]
