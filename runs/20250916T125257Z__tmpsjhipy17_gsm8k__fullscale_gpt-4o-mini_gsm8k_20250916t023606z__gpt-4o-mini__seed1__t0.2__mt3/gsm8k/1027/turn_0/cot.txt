To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to analyze the prices of the other packages and establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and their prices.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities of the packages:**
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches (price unknown)

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:**
   - For Package 1:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   - For Package 2:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   Both packages have the same price per sandwich, which is $1.50.

3. **Establish the price for the third package:**
   Since the prices are proportional and the price per sandwich remains consistent, we can use the price per sandwich to find the cost of the 8-sandwich package.

   - For Package 3 (8 sandwiches):
     \[
     \text{Cost} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Price per sandwich} = 8 \times 1.5
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for the 8-sandwich package:**
   \[
   \text{Cost} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is **$12**.
