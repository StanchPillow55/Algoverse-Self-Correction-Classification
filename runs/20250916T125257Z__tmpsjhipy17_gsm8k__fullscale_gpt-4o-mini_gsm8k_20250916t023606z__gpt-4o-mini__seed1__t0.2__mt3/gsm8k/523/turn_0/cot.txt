To find out how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left after selling some and receiving returns, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount of Bread**: The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

2. **Bread Sold in the Morning**: They sold 93 loaves in the morning. We need to subtract this amount from the initial amount:
   \[
   200 - 93 = 107
   \]
   After selling 93 loaves in the morning, they had 107 loaves left.

3. **Bread Sold in the Afternoon**: They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon. We subtract this amount from the remaining loaves:
   \[
   107 - 39 = 68
   \]
   After selling 39 loaves in the afternoon, they had 68 loaves left.

4. **Returns from the Grocery Store**: The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. We need to add this amount back to the remaining loaves:
   \[
   68 + 6 = 74
   \]
   After receiving the 6 returned loaves, they had 74 loaves left.

5. **Final Count**: Therefore, the total number of loaves of bread they had left at the end of the day is 74.

In conclusion, the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had **74 loaves of bread left**.
