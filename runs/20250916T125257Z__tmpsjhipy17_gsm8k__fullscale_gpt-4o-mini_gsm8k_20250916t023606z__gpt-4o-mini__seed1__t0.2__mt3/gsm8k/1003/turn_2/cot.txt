To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs and the variable costs associated with the lessons.

1. **Fixed Costs**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.

2. **Variable Costs**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total variable cost per session is:
   \[
   \text{Variable Cost per Session} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Cost per Student} = 10 \times 1.50 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost to run one session, including both fixed and variable costs, is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per Session} = \text{Fixed Cost} + \text{Variable Cost} = 25 + 15 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Number of Sessions per Month**: The studio is rented 3 days a week. Assuming there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the total number of sessions in a month is:
   \[
   \text{Total Sessions per Month} = 3 \text{ sessions/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 12 \text{ sessions/month}
   \]

5. **Total Earnings per Month**: The total earnings for the studio in a month can be calculated by multiplying the total cost per session by the number of sessions per month:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings per Month} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Total Sessions per Month} = 40 \times 12 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is:
\[
\boxed{480 \text{ dollars}}
\]
