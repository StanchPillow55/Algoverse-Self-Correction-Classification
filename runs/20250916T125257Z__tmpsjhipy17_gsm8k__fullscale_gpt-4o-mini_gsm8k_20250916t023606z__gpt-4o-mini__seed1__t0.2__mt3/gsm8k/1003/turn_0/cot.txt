To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs associated with renting the studio and the variable costs associated with the number of students attending the sessions.

### Step 1: Calculate the fixed costs
The fixed cost for renting the studio is $25 per session. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, we first need to determine how many sessions are held in a month.

- **Number of weeks in a month**: Approximately 4 weeks (for simplicity, we will assume 4 weeks).
- **Number of sessions per week**: 3 sessions.

Thus, the total number of sessions in a month is:
\[
\text{Total sessions} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ sessions}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total fixed cost for the month:
\[
\text{Total fixed cost} = \text{Cost per session} \times \text{Total sessions} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the variable costs
The variable cost is $1.50 per student per session. The studio currently has 10 students. We will calculate the total variable cost for the month.

- **Cost per student per session**: $1.50
- **Number of students**: 10
- **Total variable cost for one session**:
\[
\text{Total variable cost per session} = \text{Cost per student} \times \text{Number of students} = 1.50 \times 10 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total variable cost for the month:
\[
\text{Total variable cost for the month} = \text{Total variable cost per session} \times \text{Total sessions} = 15 \times 12 = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings
Now we can find the total earnings for the dance studio by adding the total fixed costs and the total variable costs:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Total fixed cost} + \text{Total variable cost} = 300 + 180 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$480**.
