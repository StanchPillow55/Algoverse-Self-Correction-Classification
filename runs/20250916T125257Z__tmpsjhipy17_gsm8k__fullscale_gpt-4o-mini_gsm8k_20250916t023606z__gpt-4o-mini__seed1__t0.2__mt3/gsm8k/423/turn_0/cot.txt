To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   \[
   \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both pairs of jeans:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} + \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 + 22 = 50
   \]

3. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:**
   \[
   \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]

5. **Calculate the savings from the tattered jeans:**
   \[
   \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]

6. **Determine the original prices of the jeans before the savings:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - The savings from the jogger jeans is $2, so:
   \[
   x - 2 = 22 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 22 + 2 = 24
   \]
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

   - The tattered jeans originally cost $28, and he saved $4 on them:
   \[
   28 - 4 = 24
   \]
   - This confirms that the original price of the tattered jeans is indeed $28.

7. **Calculate how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = 24 - 28 = -4
   \]

Since the jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, we can state that the jogger jeans cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.

**Final Answer:**
The jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.
