To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the costs of the jeans:**
   - The cost of the tattered jeans is given as $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans:**
   - The total cost of both jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} + \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 + 22 = 50
     \]

3. **Understanding the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on the purchase.
   - According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the savings from the jogger jeans:**
   - The amount saved from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

5. **Calculate the savings from the tattered jeans:**
   - The savings from the tattered jeans can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = \text{Total savings} - \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4
     \]

6. **Determine the original prices of the jeans:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - Since we know the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x - 22 = 2 \implies x = 22 + 2 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, the original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

7. **Determine the original price of the tattered jeans:**
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is already given as $28.

8. **Calculate how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The difference in original prices is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = 24 - 28 = -4
     \]
   - This indicates that the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.

9. **Final answer:**
   - The jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans; instead, they cost $4 less. Therefore, the answer to the question "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" is:
     \[
     \text{Final Answer} = -4 \text{ (indicating jogger jeans cost $4 less)}
     \]

Thus, the jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.
