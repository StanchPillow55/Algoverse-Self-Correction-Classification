To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the costs of the jeans**:
   - The cost of the tattered jeans is given as $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans**:
   - The total cost of both jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tattered jeans} + \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 + 22 = 50
     \]

3. **Understanding the savings**:
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on his purchase. The problem states that he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the savings from the jogger jeans**:
   - Let \( S_j \) be the savings from the jogger jeans. According to the problem:
     \[
     S_j = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

5. **Calculate the savings from the tattered jeans**:
   - The savings from the tattered jeans, \( S_t \), can be calculated as:
     \[
     S_t = \text{Total savings} - S_j = 6 - 2 = 4
     \]

6. **Determine the original prices of the jeans**:
   - Since the savings from the jogger jeans is $2, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans. Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, so:
     \[
     P_j - S_j = 22 \implies P_j - 2 = 22 \implies P_j = 22 + 2 = 24
     \]
   - The original price of the tattered jeans, \( P_t \), can be calculated similarly. The savings from the tattered jeans is $4, so:
     \[
     P_t - S_t = 28 \implies P_t - 4 = 28 \implies P_t = 28 + 4 = 32
     \]

7. **Calculate the difference in original prices**:
   - Now we need to find how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = P_j - P_t = 24 - 32 = -8
     \]
   - This means the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

8. **Final Answer**:
   - The jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans; instead, they cost $8 less. Therefore, the answer to the question "how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?" is:
     \[
     \boxed{-8}
     \] 

This indicates that the jogger jeans are $8 less than the tattered jeans.
