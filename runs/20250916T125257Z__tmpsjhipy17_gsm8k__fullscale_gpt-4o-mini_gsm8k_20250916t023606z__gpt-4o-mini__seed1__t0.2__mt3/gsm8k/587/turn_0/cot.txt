Let \( b \) represent the number of blue jelly beans in the jar. According to the problem, we can express the number of red and green jelly beans in terms of \( b \):

1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[
   r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
   \]

2. The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
   \[
   g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
   \]

Now, we can express the total number of jelly beans in the jar as the sum of red, blue, and green jelly beans:
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]
\[
3.00b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
\]

Now that we have the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red and green jelly beans:

- For red jelly beans:
\[
r = 0.99b = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
\]

- For green jelly beans:
\[
g = 1.01b = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
\]

Next, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[
g - r = 1515 - 1485 = 30
\]

Thus, the jar contains **30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
