To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the time taken for each part of James's journey across the lake.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance James swims initially

James swims 60% of the total distance of the lake, which is 20 miles.

\[
\text{Distance swum initially} = 0.6 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance

James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour. We can calculate the time taken to swim the initial 12 miles using the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time for initial swim} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the resting time

James rests for half as long as the swimming time. Therefore, the resting time is:

\[
\text{Resting time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance

After swimming 12 miles, the remaining distance to swim is:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the speed for the remaining distance

James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed. His original speed is 2 miles per hour, so half of that is:

\[
\text{Speed for remaining swim} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance

Using the same formula for time:

\[
\text{Time for remaining swim} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{\text{Speed for remaining swim}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time for remaining swim} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total time taken

Now, we add the time taken for the initial swim, the resting time, and the time taken for the remaining swim:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time for initial swim} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time for remaining swim}
\]

Substituting the calculated times:

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it took James to get across the lake is:

\[
\boxed{17} \text{ hours}
\]
