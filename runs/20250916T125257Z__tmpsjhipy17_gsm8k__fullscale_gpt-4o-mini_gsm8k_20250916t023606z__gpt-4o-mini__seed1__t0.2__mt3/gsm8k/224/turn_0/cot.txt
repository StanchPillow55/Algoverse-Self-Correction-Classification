To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them separately and then add those amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate Carlos's total rental cost.**

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour. He uses the canoe for 3 hours.

To find the total cost for Carlos, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he used the canoe:

\[
\text{Total cost for Carlos} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Carlos} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Benji's total rental cost.**

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour. He uses the raft for 5 hours.

To find the total cost for Benji, we again multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he used the raft:

\[
\text{Total cost for Benji} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Number of hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Benji} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for both Carlos and Benji.**

Now that we have the total costs for both Carlos and Benji, we can add them together to find the total amount they will pay for their rentals:

\[
\text{Total cost for both} = \text{Total cost for Carlos} + \text{Total cost for Benji}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for both} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for both} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Carlos and Benji will pay a total of **$180** for their rentals altogether.
