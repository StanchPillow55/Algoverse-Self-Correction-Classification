To determine how much money Mulan has left after her transactions, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mulan's initial amount of money.**
   - Mulan starts with $40.
   - Her father gives her an additional $100.
   - Therefore, her total initial amount is:
     \[
     40 + 100 = 140
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the items Mulan buys.**
   - Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each. The cost for the jeans is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60
     \]
   - She also buys a bag for $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost of her purchases is:
     \[
     60 + 20 = 80
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money Mulan has left after her purchases.**
   - We subtract the total cost of her purchases from her initial amount:
     \[
     140 - 80 = 60
     \]

Thus, after buying the jeans and the bag, Mulan has $60 left.

**Final Answer:**
Mulan has $60 left.
