Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

1. **Sales at the Green House**:
   - Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the green house is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - After this sale, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:
     \[
     x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}
     \]

2. **Sales at the Red House**:
   - Melanie sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{3} - 2
     \]

3. **Sales at the Orange House**:
   - Melanie sold half of what was left at the orange house.
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left before this sale is \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \).
   - The number of vacuum cleaners sold at the orange house is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
     \]
   - The number of vacuum cleaners left after this sale is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right)
     \]

   To simplify this, we first find a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = \frac{2x - 6}{3}
   \]
   Now, we calculate half of this:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x - 6}{3} \right) = \frac{2x - 6}{6}
   \]
   Now, we need to subtract this from \( \frac{2x - 6}{3} \):
   \[
   \frac{2x - 6}{3} - \frac{2x - 6}{6}
   \]
   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6:
   \[
   \frac{2(2x - 6)}{6} - \frac{2x - 6}{6} = \frac{4x - 12 - (2x - 6)}{6} = \frac{4x - 12 - 2x + 6}{6} = \frac{2x - 6}{6}
   \]
   Thus, the number of vacuum cleaners left after selling at the orange house is:
   \[
   \frac{2x - 6}{6}
   \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We know that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2x - 6}{6} = 5
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   2x - 6 = 30
   \]
   - Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   2x = 36
   \]
   - Divide by 2:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

Thus, Melanie started with \( \boxed{18} \) vacuum cleaners.
