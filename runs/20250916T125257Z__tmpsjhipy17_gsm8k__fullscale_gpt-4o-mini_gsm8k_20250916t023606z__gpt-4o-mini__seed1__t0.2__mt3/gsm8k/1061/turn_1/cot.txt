Let \( D \) represent the time Donovan took to complete his part of the meal in minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \).

The total time taken to make the meal is given as 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
D + (D + 18) = 98
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation:

\[
2D + 18 = 98
\]

Next, we will isolate \( 2D \) by subtracting 18 from both sides:

\[
2D = 98 - 18
\]
\[
2D = 80
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find Betsy's time:

\[
\text{Betsy's time} = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
\]

Thus, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.

Finally, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{58}
\]
