To find the average of Jared's typing speeds over three measurements, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the three measurements**:
   - The first measurement is 47 WPM (words per minute).
   - The second measurement is 52 WPM.
   - The third measurement is calculated by adding 5 WPM to the second measurement.

2. **Calculate the third measurement**:
   \[
   \text{Third measurement} = 52 \text{ WPM} + 5 \text{ WPM} = 57 \text{ WPM}
   \]

3. **List all three measurements**:
   - First measurement: 47 WPM
   - Second measurement: 52 WPM
   - Third measurement: 57 WPM

4. **Calculate the sum of the three measurements**:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 47 + 52 + 57
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add 47 and 52:
     \[
     47 + 52 = 99
     \]
   - Now, add 57 to the result:
     \[
     99 + 57 = 156
     \]

5. **Calculate the average of the three measurements**:
   The average is calculated by dividing the sum of the measurements by the number of measurements (which is 3):
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum}}{\text{Number of measurements}} = \frac{156}{3}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   156 \div 3 = 52
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The average of the three measurements is:
   \[
   \boxed{52} \text{ WPM}
   \]
