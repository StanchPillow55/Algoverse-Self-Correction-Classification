To determine how many vines of cherry tomatoes Steve needs to grow, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Steve's Daily Tomato Consumption**:
   - According to the problem, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculate Weekly Tomato Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in a week:
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes per week} = \text{Tomatoes per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - The problem states that one vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes in a week, we can use the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Total tomatoes needed per week}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine per week}} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}}
   \]
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42}{3} = 14
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
