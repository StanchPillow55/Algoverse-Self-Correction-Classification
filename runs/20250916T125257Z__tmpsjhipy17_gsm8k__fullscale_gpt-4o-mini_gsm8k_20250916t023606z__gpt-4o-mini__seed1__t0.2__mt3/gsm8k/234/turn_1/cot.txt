To solve the problem, we need to determine how many vines of cherry tomatoes Steve needs to grow in order to meet his daily consumption of tomatoes.

1. **Understanding Steve's Consumption**:
   - We know that Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Calculating Weekly Consumption**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate Steve's weekly consumption of tomatoes:
     \[
     \text{Weekly consumption} = \text{Daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days in a week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weekly consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
     \]

3. **Understanding Tomato Production per Vine**:
   - Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculating the Number of Vines Needed**:
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Weekly consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine per week}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine/week}} = 14 \text{ vines}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his weekly consumption of cherry tomatoes.

In conclusion, the total number of vines Steve needs to grow is **14**.
