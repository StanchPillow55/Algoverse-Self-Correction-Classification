To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount**:
   - Shirt: $25
   - Shorts: $35
   - Total cost before discount = Shirt price + Shorts price
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount**:
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 30% of the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final price.
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final price} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much money Joe has left after the purchase**:
   - Joe starts with $50.
   - Subtract the final price from the amount Joe has.
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after purchasing the outfit, Joe will have **$8** left.

**Final Answer**: Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.
