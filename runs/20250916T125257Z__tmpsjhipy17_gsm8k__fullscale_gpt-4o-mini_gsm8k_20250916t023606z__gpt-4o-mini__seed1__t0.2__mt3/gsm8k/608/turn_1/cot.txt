To determine how much money Joe will have left after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.**
   - Joe picks out a shirt priced at $25 and a pair of shorts priced at $35.
   - Total cost before discount = Price of shirt + Price of shorts
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Apply the 30% discount to the total cost.**
   - The discount amount can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 30\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Now, subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine how much money Joe has left after the purchase.**
   - Joe starts with $50. We subtract the total cost after the discount from this amount:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after purchasing the outfit, Joe will have **$8** left.

Final answer: **$8**
