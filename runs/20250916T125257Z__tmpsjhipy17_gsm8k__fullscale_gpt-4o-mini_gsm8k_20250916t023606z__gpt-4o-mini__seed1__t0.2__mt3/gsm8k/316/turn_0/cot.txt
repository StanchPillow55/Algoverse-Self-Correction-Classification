To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna.**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon's purchase.**
   The store initially had 50 marbles. After adding the 20 marbles he bought, the total number of marbles in the store becomes:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.**
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of marbles in the store.**
   Now, we add the marbles Solomon received from his father to the total number of marbles already in the store:
   \[
   \text{New total marbles} = \text{Total marbles} + \text{Marbles from father}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New total marbles} = 70 + 8 = 78
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles.**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Total marbles} \times \text{Weight per marble}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

Finally, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
\]
