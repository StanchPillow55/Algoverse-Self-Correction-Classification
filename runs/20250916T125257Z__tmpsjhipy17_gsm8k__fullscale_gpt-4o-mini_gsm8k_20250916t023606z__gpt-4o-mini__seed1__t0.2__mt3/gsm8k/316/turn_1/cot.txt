To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna.

Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna. He already had 50 marbles in the store.

\[
\text{Total marbles after buying from Johanna} = \text{Marbles in store} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
\]

\[
\text{Total marbles} = 50 + 20 = 70
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.

Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles his father gave him as follows:

\[
\text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
\]

\[
\text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new total number of marbles Solomon has.

Now we add the marbles Solomon received from his father to the total number of marbles he already has:

\[
\text{New total marbles} = \text{Total marbles} + \text{Marbles from father}
\]

\[
\text{New total marbles} = 70 + 8 = 78
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total weight of the marbles.

Each marble weighs 2 kg. To find the total weight of the marbles, we multiply the total number of marbles by the weight of each marble:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Total marbles} \times \text{Weight of each marble}
\]

\[
\text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
\]

### Final Answer

The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \( \boxed{156} \) kg.
