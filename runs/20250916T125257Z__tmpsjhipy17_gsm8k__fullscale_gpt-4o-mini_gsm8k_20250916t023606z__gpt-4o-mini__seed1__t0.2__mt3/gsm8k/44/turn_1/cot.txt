To find Charlie's net profit from selling 20 beeswax candles, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed for 20 candles.**
   - Charlie can make 10 tapered candles from 1 pound of beeswax.
   - To find out how many pounds he needs for 20 candles, we use the ratio:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of beeswax} = \frac{\text{Number of candles}}{\text{Candles per pound}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - Each pound of beeswax and the wicks costs $10.00.
   - Since he needs 2 pounds, the total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Pounds of beeswax} \times \text{Cost per pound} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.**
   - Each candle sells for $2.00.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 20 candles is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of candles} \times \text{Price per candle} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the net profit.**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Net profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 40 - 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 beeswax candles is **$20.00**.
