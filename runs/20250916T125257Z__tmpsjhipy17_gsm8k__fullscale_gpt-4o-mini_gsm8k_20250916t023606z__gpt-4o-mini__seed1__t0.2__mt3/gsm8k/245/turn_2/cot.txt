To solve the problem, let's define the variables and break down the information given step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - We know there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Snails**:
   - The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
     \[
     32 - 4 = 28
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can express this as:
     \[
     28 = 2F
     \]

4. **Solve for \( F \)**:
   - To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     F = \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of fish in each aquarium is \( 14 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{There are 14 fish in each aquarium.}
\]
