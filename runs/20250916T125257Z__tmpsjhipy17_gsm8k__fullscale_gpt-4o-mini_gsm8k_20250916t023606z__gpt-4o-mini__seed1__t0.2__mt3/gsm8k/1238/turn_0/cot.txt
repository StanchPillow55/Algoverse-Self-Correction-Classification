To determine how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the weekly cost and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a year.

1. **Calculate the cost of pasta:**
   - The cost of pasta is given as $1.00 per box.
   - Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the weekly cost for pasta is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost of pasta} = 1.00 \text{ (cost per box)}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of cheddar cheese:**
   - The cost of cheddar cheese is given as $3.00.
   - Therefore, the weekly cost for cheddar cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost of cheddar cheese} = 3.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of gruyere cheese:**
   - The problem states that Bud spends twice the amount on gruyere cheese compared to cheddar cheese.
   - Therefore, the cost of gruyere cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of gruyere cheese} = 2 \times 3.00 = 6.00
     \]
   - Thus, the weekly cost for gruyere cheese is:
     \[
     \text{Weekly cost of gruyere cheese} = 6.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   - Now, we can find the total weekly cost by adding the costs of pasta, cheddar cheese, and gruyere cheese:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Weekly cost of pasta} + \text{Weekly cost of cheddar cheese} + \text{Weekly cost of gruyere cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly cost} = 1.00 + 3.00 + 6.00 = 10.00
     \]

5. **Calculate the total annual cost:**
   - Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, there are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total annual cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 52
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total annual cost} = 10.00 \times 52 = 520.00
     \]

Finally, Bud spends **$520.00** on making macaroni and cheese in one year. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{520.00}
\]
