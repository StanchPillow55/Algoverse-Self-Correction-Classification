To solve the problem, we need to find the age of Carver's son based on the information given about Carver's age.

1. **Identify Carver's Age**: 
   Carver is currently 45 years old.

2. **Set Up the Equation**: 
   According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( s \) represent the age of Carver's son. The phrase "twice the age of his son" can be written as \( 2s \). Therefore, "5 years less than twice the age of his son" can be expressed as \( 2s - 5 \).

   We can set up the equation based on the information provided:
   \[
   45 = 2s - 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( s \)**:
   To find \( s \), we need to isolate it in the equation. We can start by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2s
   \]
   \[
   50 = 2s
   \]

   Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = 25
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   Carver's son is 25 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Carver's son is } 25 \text{ years old.}
\]
