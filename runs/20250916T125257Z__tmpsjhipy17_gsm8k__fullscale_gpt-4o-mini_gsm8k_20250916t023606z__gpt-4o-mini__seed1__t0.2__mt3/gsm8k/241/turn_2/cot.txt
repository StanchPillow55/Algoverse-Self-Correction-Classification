To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively by the end, given the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the reading scenario:**
   - Both Dolly and Pandora read their own books.
   - Additionally, they read each other's books.

3. **Calculate the total number of books read by each person:**
   - **Dolly's reading:**
     - Dolly reads her 2 books.
     - Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
     - Total books read by Dolly = 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.

   - **Pandora's reading:**
     - Pandora reads her 1 book.
     - Pandora also reads both of Dolly's 2 books.
     - Total books read by Pandora = 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

4. **Calculate the total number of books read collectively:**
   - Total books read by Dolly = 3
   - Total books read by Pandora = 3
   - Total books read collectively = 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.

5. **Final answer:**
   - By the end, Dolly and Pandora will have collectively read **6 books**.

Thus, the final answer is **6 books**.
