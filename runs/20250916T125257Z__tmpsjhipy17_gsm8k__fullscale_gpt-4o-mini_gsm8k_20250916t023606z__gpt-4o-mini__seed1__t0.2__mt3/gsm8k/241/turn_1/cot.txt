To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Calculate the total number of books:**
   - Total books = Books owned by Dolly + Books owned by Pandora
   - Total books = 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

3. **Determine the reading scenario:**
   - According to the problem, both Dolly and Pandora will read each other's books as well as their own.
   - This means:
     - Dolly will read her 2 books and also read Pandora's 1 book.
     - Pandora will read her 1 book and also read both of Dolly's 2 books.

4. **Count the total number of readings:**
   - Dolly reads: 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
   - Pandora reads: 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

5. **Collectively, how many books are read?**
   - Since both Dolly and Pandora are reading the same books, we need to consider the unique books read rather than counting each reading separately.
   - The total number of unique books is 3 (as calculated in step 2).

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, by the end, they will collectively read 3 unique books.

Thus, the final answer is **3 books**.
