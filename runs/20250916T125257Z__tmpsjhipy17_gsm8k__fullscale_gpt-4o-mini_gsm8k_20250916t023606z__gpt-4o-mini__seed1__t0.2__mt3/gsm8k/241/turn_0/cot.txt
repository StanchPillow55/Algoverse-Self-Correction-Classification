To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the total number of books:**
   - The total number of books is the sum of the books each person has:
     \[
     \text{Total books} = \text{Books by Dolly} + \text{Books by Pandora} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]

3. **Consider the reading scenario:**
   - Dolly reads her own 2 books.
   - Dolly also reads Pandora's 1 book.
   - Therefore, Dolly reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Books read by Dolly} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]

   - Pandora reads her own 1 book.
   - Pandora also reads both of Dolly's 2 books.
   - Therefore, Pandora reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Books read by Pandora} = 1 + 2 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of books read:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora. However, we must ensure we do not double-count any books.
   - Since Dolly reads all 3 books (2 of her own and 1 of Pandora's), and Pandora also reads all 3 books (1 of her own and 2 of Dolly's), we can conclude that they are reading the same set of books.

5. **Final count of unique books read:**
   - The unique books being read are the same 3 books (2 from Dolly and 1 from Pandora). Therefore, we do not need to add the counts of books read by each person separately since they are reading the same books.

Thus, the total number of unique books read collectively by Dolly and Pandora is:
\[
\text{Total unique books read} = 3
\]

**Final Answer:**
Dolly and Pandora will collectively read **3 books** by the end.
