To solve the problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane. We can find the speed by using the formula:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

Given that the plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, we can calculate the speed as follows:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Now that we know the speed of the plane is 400 miles per hour, we need to find out how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles at this speed. We can use the same formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values for the additional distance and the speed:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, it will take an additional 5 hours to travel the additional 2000 miles.

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

The additional time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is **5 hours**.
