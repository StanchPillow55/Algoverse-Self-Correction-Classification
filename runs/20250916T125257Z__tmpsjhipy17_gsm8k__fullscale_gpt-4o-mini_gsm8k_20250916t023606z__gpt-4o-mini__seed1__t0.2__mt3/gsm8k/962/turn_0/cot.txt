To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of travel tickets based on the information provided about the supplies.

1. **Identify the cost of supplies**: 
   Jen pays $400 for supplies.

2. **Determine the cost of travel tickets**: 
   The problem states that the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. 

   To find 50% of the cost of supplies, we calculate:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.50 \times 400 = 200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of travel tickets**: 
   Since the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies:
   \[
   \text{Cost of travel tickets} = \text{Cost of supplies} + 50\% \text{ of Cost of supplies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of travel tickets} = 400 + 200 = 600
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total cost of travel tickets is $600.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]
