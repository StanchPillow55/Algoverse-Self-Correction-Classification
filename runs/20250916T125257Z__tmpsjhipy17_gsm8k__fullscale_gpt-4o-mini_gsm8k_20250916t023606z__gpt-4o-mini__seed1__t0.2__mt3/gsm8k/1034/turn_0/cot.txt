To determine how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the pencils separately, and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the books:**
   - Ted buys 3 books, and each book costs $16.
   - The total cost for the books can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Cost per book}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of books} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - Ted buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6.
   - The total cost for the pencils can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pencils} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount spent:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of books} + \text{Total cost of pencils}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 48 + 18 = 66 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Ted spent a total of **66 dollars**. 

Final answer: **66 dollars**.
