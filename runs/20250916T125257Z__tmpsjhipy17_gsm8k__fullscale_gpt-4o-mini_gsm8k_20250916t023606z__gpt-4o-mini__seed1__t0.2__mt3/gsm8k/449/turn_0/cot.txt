To find out how many colors of crayons Beatrice bought in total, we will break the problem down into manageable steps.

1. **Identify the number of packets and the number of crayons in each type of packet**:
   - Beatrice bought a total of 10 packets of crayons.
   - Out of these, 6 packets had 8 pieces of colors each.
   - The remaining 4 packets had 16 pieces of colors each.

2. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the first type of packet (8 pieces each)**:
   - For the 6 packets with 8 pieces of colors:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons from these packets} = 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ pieces/packet} = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the second type of packet (16 pieces each)**:
   - For the 4 packets with 16 pieces of colors:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons from these packets} = 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ pieces/packet} = 64 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Add the total number of crayons from both types of packets**:
   - Now, we will add the total crayons from both types of packets to find the overall total:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \text{Total from 8-piece packets} + \text{Total from 16-piece packets}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = 48 \text{ pieces} + 64 \text{ pieces} = 112 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of colors of crayons that Beatrice bought is:
   \[
   \boxed{112}
   \]
