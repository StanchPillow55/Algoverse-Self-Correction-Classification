To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David based on the information given.

1. **Identify the amount of laundry done by Sarah**:
   - We know from the problem that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Calculate the amount of laundry done by David**:
   - The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. We can express this relationship mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
     \]
   - We can rearrange this to find David's laundry:
     \[
     \text{David's laundry} = \frac{\text{Sarah's laundry}}{4}
     \]
   - Substituting Sarah's laundry (400 pounds) into the equation:
     \[
     \text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of laundry done by Raymond**:
   - The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry}
     \]
   - Substituting Sarah's laundry (400 pounds) into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David**:
   - Now we need to find the difference between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond and David:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( \boxed{100} \) pounds.
