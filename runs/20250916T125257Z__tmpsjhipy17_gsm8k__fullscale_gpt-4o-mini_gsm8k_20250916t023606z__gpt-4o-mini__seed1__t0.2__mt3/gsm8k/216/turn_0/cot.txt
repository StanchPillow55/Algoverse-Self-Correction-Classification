To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Janeth will owe after borrowing $2000 and adding 10% interest, and then calculate how much she will have paid off after making monthly payments of $165 for 12 months.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay.

Janeth borrowed $2000 and agreed to pay an additional 10% of that amount. 

First, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
\]

Now, we add this interest to the original amount borrowed:

\[
\text{Total amount to repay} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.

Janeth plans to pay $165 per month for 12 months. We calculate the total amount she will pay:

\[
\text{Total payments} = \text{Monthly payment} \times \text{Number of months} = 165 \times 12
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
165 \times 12 = 1980
\]

### Step 3: Determine the remaining balance after 12 months.

Now, we need to find out how much Janeth's remaining balance will be after she has made her total payments. We subtract the total payments from the total amount she needs to repay:

\[
\text{Remaining balance} = \text{Total amount to repay} - \text{Total payments}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Remaining balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220
\]

### Final Answer

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be **$220**.
