To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pens George has:**
   - According to the problem, George has 18 pens.

2. **Determine the number of pens Timothy has:**
   - The problem states that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns.
   - We can calculate the number of pens Timothy has using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times \text{Number of pens George has}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of pens George has:
     \[
     \text{Number of pens Timothy has} = 3 \times 18 = 54
     \]

3. **Determine the number of pens Sarah has:**
   - The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
   - We can calculate the number of pens Sarah has using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of pens Timothy has}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of pens Timothy has:
     \[
     \text{Number of pens Sarah has} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of pens Sarah has is \( \boxed{27} \).
