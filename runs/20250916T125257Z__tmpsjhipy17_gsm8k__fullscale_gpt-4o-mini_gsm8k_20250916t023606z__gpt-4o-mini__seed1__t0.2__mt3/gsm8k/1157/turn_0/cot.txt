To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of Carl and then calculate the length of his cane based on that height.

1. **Determine Isabel's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Isabel is 7 feet tall.

2. **Determine Ned's height**: 
   The problem states that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. Therefore, we can calculate Ned's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine Carl's height**: 
   The problem states that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Thus, we can calculate Carl's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \text{ foot} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the length of Carl's cane**: 
   The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Carl's cane as follows:
   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Carl's height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ feet} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

In conclusion, the length of Carl's cane is \( \boxed{3} \) feet.
