To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends spend on playing games at the arcade over a period of 4 hours. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the time each player can play with one quarter:**
   - Jack can play for **20 minutes** with 1 quarter.
   - Two of his friends can only play for **half as long** as Jack. Therefore, each of these two friends can play for:
     \[
     \text{Time for each friend} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The fourth friend can play for **1.5 times** as long as Jack. Therefore, this friend can play for:
     \[
     \text{Time for this friend} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculating the total time each player can play with one quarter:**
   - Jack: 20 minutes
   - Friend 1: 10 minutes
   - Friend 2: 10 minutes
   - Friend 3: 30 minutes

3. **Calculating the total time played by all players in 4 hours:**
   - First, convert 4 hours into minutes:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculating how many quarters each player can use in 240 minutes:**
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes per quarter, so the number of quarters he uses is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters for Jack} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - Each of the two friends can play for 10 minutes per quarter, so the number of quarters each of these friends uses is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters for each friend} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]
   - The better friend can play for 30 minutes per quarter, so the number of quarters this friend uses is:
     \[
     \text{Quarters for better friend} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

5. **Calculating the total number of quarters used:**
   - Total quarters used by all players:
     \[
     \text{Total quarters} = 12 \text{ (Jack)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 1)} + 24 \text{ (Friend 2)} + 8 \text{ (Better friend)} = 68 \text{ quarters}
     \]

6. **Calculating the total amount of money spent:**
   - Each quarter is worth $0.25. Therefore, the total amount of money spent is:
     \[
     \text{Total money} = 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter} = 17 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, the total amount of money used by Jack and his friends to play games at the arcade for 4 hours is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ dollars}}
\]
