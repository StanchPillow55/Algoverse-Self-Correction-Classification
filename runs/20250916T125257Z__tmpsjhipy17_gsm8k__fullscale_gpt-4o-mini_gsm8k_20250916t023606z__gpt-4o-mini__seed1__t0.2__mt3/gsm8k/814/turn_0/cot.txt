To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack and his friends spend on playing games at the arcade over a period of 4 hours. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the playing time for each person

1. **Jack's playing time**:
   - Jack can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter.
   - In 4 hours, which is 240 minutes, we need to find out how many quarters Jack will use.
   - The number of quarters Jack uses is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Jack uses} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{\text{Time per quarter}} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{20 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 12 \text{ quarters}
     \]

2. **Friend 1's playing time** (significantly worse):
   - This friend can only play half as long as Jack. Therefore, the time they can play with 1 quarter is:
     \[
     \text{Time for Friend 1} = \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters Friend 1 uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 1 uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

3. **Friend 2's playing time** (also significantly worse):
   - This friend has the same playing time as Friend 1, so they also can play for 10 minutes per quarter and will use:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 2 uses} = 24 \text{ quarters}
     \]

4. **Friend 3's playing time** (significantly better):
   - This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack. Therefore, the time they can play with 1 quarter is:
     \[
     \text{Time for Friend 3} = 20 \text{ minutes} \times 1.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The number of quarters Friend 3 uses in 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Number of quarters Friend 3 uses} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/quarter}} = 8 \text{ quarters}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of quarters used

Now we can sum up the total number of quarters used by all players:
\[
\text{Total quarters} = \text{Quarters by Jack} + \text{Quarters by Friend 1} + \text{Quarters by Friend 2} + \text{Quarters by Friend 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost

Each quarter costs $0.25. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total quarters} \times \text{Cost per quarter} = 68 \text{ quarters} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 68 \times 0.25 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money used by Jack and his friends is:
\[
\boxed{17 \text{ dollars}}
\]
