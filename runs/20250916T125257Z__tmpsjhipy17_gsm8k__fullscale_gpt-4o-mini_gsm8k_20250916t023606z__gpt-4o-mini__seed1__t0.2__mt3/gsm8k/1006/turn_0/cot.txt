To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet**.
2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons**.
3. **Calculate the total cost to fill the pool based on the price per gallon**.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular pool can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

\[
25 \times 14 = 350 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

Now, multiply by the depth:

\[
350 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

So, the volume of the pool is \( 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \).

### Step 2: Convert the Volume from Cubic Feet to Gallons

The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume by 5.9 to find the number of gallons needed. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Gallons} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 5.9
\]

Calculating this:

\[
1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost to Fill the Pool

The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Thus, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
C = \text{Gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is **$826**.
