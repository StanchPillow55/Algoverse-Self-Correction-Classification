Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as \( S \) gallons. Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago would be \( 2S \) gallons, since it had twice as much water as the small pool.

Both pools have leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. In 4 minutes, the total amount of water lost from each pool can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Water lost in 4 minutes} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

Now, let's calculate the current amounts of water in both pools:

1. **Current amount of water in the small pool:**
   \[
   \text{Current water in small pool} = S - 16
   \]

2. **Current amount of water in the big pool:**
   \[
   \text{Current water in big pool} = 2S - 16
   \]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Expand the right side:
   \[
   2S - 16 = 4S - 64
   \]

2. Rearranging the equation to isolate \( S \):
   \[
   2S - 4S = -64 + 16
   \]
   \[
   -2S = -48
   \]

3. Divide both sides by -2:
   \[
   S = 24
   \]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:

\[
\text{Current water in small pool} = S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has **8 gallons** of water.

Finally, we can state the final answer:

\[
\text{The small pool has } \boxed{8} \text{ gallons of water now.}
\]
