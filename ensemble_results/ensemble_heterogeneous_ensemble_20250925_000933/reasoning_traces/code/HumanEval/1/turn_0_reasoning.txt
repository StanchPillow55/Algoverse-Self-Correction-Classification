=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved in the solution:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Cleaning**: 
   - The input string may contain spaces that we need to ignore. Therefore, the first step is to remove any spaces from the string.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We will use a list to store the separated groups of parentheses.
   - We will also need a counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses as we iterate through the string. This will help us determine when we have completed a group.

3. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - As we iterate through the cleaned string, we will:
     - Increment the counter for every opening parenthesis `(`.
     - Decrement the counter for every closing parenthesis `)`.
     - Keep track of the current group of parentheses in a temporary string.

4. **Detecting Complete Groups**:
   - Whenever the counter returns to zero, it indicates that we have a complete group of balanced parentheses. At this point, we can add the current group to our list and reset the temporary string for the next group.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the list of separated groups.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the above logic in the `separate_paren_groups` function.

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """Separate groups of nested parentheses from the input string."""
    # Step 1: Remove spaces from the input string
    cleaned_string = paren_string.replace(" ", "")
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    result = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the cleaned string
    for char in cleaned_string:
        current_group += char  # Add the current character to the current group
        
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1  # Increment balance for an opening parenthesis
        elif char == ')':
            balance -= 1  # Decrement balance for a closing parenthesis
        
        # Step 4: Check if we have a complete group
        if balance == 0:
            result.append(current_group)  # Add the complete group to the result
            current_group = ""  # Reset current group for the next one
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by cleaning the input string to remove spaces.
- We initialize `result` to hold the final groups, `current_group` to build each group, and `balance` to track the number of open versus closed parentheses.
- We loop through each character in the cleaned string, updating `current_group` and `balance` accordingly.
- When `balance` reaches zero, it indicates a complete group, which we then append to `result`.
- Finally, we return the list of separated groups.

This implementation effectively separates the groups of parentheses as required by the problem statement.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's go through the problem step by step and provide a complete solution.

Reasoning Process:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The input to the function is a string containing multiple groups of nested parentheses. The goal is to separate these groups into separate strings and return them as a list.

2. **Identifying the Key Requirements**:
   - The groups of parentheses are balanced, meaning each open parenthesis has a corresponding clo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we need to carefully parse the string to identify and extract each balanced group of parentheses. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - We'll need a list to store the resulting groups of parentheses.
   - A counter to keep track of the balance of parentheses (i.e., the difference between the number of op...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me think through this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:
   - We need to find groups of balanced parentheses
   - Each group should be complete (not nested within another group)
   - Spaces should be ignored
   - The groups should be returned as separate strings in a list

2) Key observations:
   - A balanced group starts with '(' and ends with ')'
   - We need to keep track of nesting level to know when a complet...

--- Model 5 Response ---
Model 5 (openai:gpt-3.5-turbo): To solve this problem, we need to separate the groups of nested parentheses in the input string and return them as a list of strings. We can do this by iterating through the input string and identifying each separate group of parentheses.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. Remove any spaces from the input string to simplify the processing.
2. Initialize an empty list to store the separate groups of parentheses.
3. Initialize a variable...
