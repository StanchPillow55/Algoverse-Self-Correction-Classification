=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of extracting the decimal part from a given positive floating point number, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Components**: A floating point number consists of two parts: the integer part and the decimal part. For example, in the number `3.5`, `3` is the integer part and `0.5` is the decimal part.

2. **Extracting the Integer Part**: We can obtain the integer part of a floating point number using the `int()` function in Python, which truncates the decimal portion and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the number.

3. **Calculating the Decimal Part**: Once we have the integer part, we can find the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number. This will give us the leftover portion, which is the decimal part.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we will return the decimal part as the result of the function.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `truncate_number` function.

### Implementation

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    """ Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into
    an integer part (largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals
    (leftover part always smaller than 1).

    Return the decimal part of the number.
    >>> truncate_number(3.5)
    0.5
    """
    # Step 1: Get the integer part of the number
    integer_part = int(number)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    # Step 3: Return the decimal part
    return decimal_part
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function Definition**: We define the function `truncate_number` that takes a single argument `number` of type `float`.

2. **Integer Part Calculation**: We use `int(number)` to get the integer part of the number. This effectively truncates the decimal portion.

3. **Decimal Part Calculation**: We compute the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from the original number (`number - integer_part`). This gives us the fractional part.

4. **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the computed decimal part.

### Testing the Function

To ensure our function works correctly, we can run the provided example and some additional test cases:

```python
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Expected output: 0.5
print(truncate_number(2.75))  # Expected output: 0.75
print(truncate_number(5.0))    # Expected output: 0.0
print(truncate_number(0.99))   # Expected output: 0.99
```

This implementation is straightforward and effectively extracts the decimal part from a positive floating point number.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of extracting the decimal part of a positive floating-point number, we need to break down the task into clear steps. Let's go through the thought process:

### Problem Understanding

Given a positive floating-point number, we want to separate it into two parts:
1. The integer part: This is the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to the given number. For example, for the number 3.5, the integer part is 3.
2. The decimal part: This is the lef...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me think through this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what we need to do:
   * We receive a positive float number as input
   * We need to return just the decimal part
   * The decimal part is what's left after removing the integer part

2) Examples to consider:
   * 3.5 → should return 0.5
   * 1.25 → should return 0.25
   * 7.0 → should return 0.0
   * 4.8 → should return 0.8

3) Approaches I could take:
   * Option 1: Subtract the ...

--- Model 5 Response ---
Model 5 (openai:gpt-3.5-turbo): To solve this problem, we need to extract the decimal part of a given floating point number. One way to do this is by subtracting the integer part of the number from the original number.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. Convert the floating point number to an integer to get the integer part.
2. Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
3. Return the decimal part.

Now, let's implement the solution:
