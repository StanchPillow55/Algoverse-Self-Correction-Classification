=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break down the components of the sweater and calculate the number of stitches for each part.

1. **Identify the number of stitches for the body of the sweater**:
   - The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.

2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar**:
   - The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches of the body.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the collar is:
     \[
     \text{Collar stitches} = \frac{900}{10} = 90 \text{ stitches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette**:
   - The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   - Therefore, the number of stitches for the rosette is:
     \[
     \text{Rosette stitches} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stitches used so far**:
   - We need to sum the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette:
     \[
     \text{Total stitches so far} = \text{Body stitches} + \text{Collar stitches} + \text{Rosette stitches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total stitches so far} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
     \]

5. **Determine the total number of stitches available for the sleeves**:
   - The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so we need to find out how many stitches are left for the sleeves:
     \[
     \text{Sleeves stitches} = \text{Total stitches} - \text{Total stitches so far}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sleeves stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of stitches for each sleeve**:
   - Since there are two sleeves, we divide the total number of stitches for the sleeves by 2:
     \[
     \text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315 \text{ stitches}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

**Final Answer**: Each sleeve takes 315 stitches.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches to complete.
- The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches for the body.
- The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
- The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stitches for the collar.
Stitches for the collar = 1/10 of 900 stitches = 90 stitches

Step 2: Calculate the number of sti...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stitches each sleeve takes in the sweater project. We are given several pieces of information about the number of stitches required for different parts of the sweater:

1. The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
2. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches as the body.
3. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
4. The entire sweater project requires 1800 stitches.

Let's break down the prob...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Body of sweater = 900 stitches
* Collar = 1/10 of body stitches
* Rosette = 2× collar stitches
* Total project = 1800 stitches
* Need to find stitches per sleeve (2 sleeves)

2. Calculate collar stitches:
* Collar = 1/10 × 900
* Collar = 90 stitches

3. Calculate rosette stitches:
* Rosette = 2 × collar stitches
* Rosette = 2 × 90
* Rosette = 180 stitches

4. Find total stitc...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the number of stitches for the collar and the rosette.

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches as the body of the sweater, so it takes 900/10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so it takes 90*2 = 180 stitches.

Now, let's add up the number of stitches for the body, collar, and rosette. This gives us 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the two sleeves togeth...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The body of the sweater takes 900 stitches.
   * The collar takes 1/10 of the stitches needed for the body.
   * The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar.
   * The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project.
   * We need to find the number of stitches for each sleeve.

2. Calculate the number of stitches for the collar:
   * Collar stitches = 1/10 × Body sti...
