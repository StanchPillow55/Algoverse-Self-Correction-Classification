=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of students in each category and then determining the number of female students.

1. **Total Enrollment**: The total number of students at Brook Hills High School is 3000.

2. **Students Over 16 Years Old**: 
   - Half of the students are over 16 years old.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

3. **Male Students Over 16 Years Old**: 
   - One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]

4. **Female Students Over 16 Years Old**: 
   - To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
     \]

5. **Students Under 16 Years Old**: 
   - The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
     \]

6. **Male Students Under 16 Years Old**: 
   - One-half of the students under 16 are male.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750
     \]

7. **Female Students Under 16 Years Old**: 
   - To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
     \]

8. **Total Female Students**: 
   - Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total female students} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
     \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \( \boxed{1875} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of students over and under 16 years old.

Brook Hills High School has a total enrollment of 3000 students.

- Half of these students are over 16 years old:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 \text{ students over 16 years old}
  \]

- The remaining half are under 16 years old:
  \[

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Total number of students = 3000

2. Let's split students by age:
* Students over 16 = 1/2 × 3000 = 1500 students
* Students under 16 = 1/2 × 3000 = 1500 students

3. For students over 16:
* Male students over 16 = 1/4 × 1500 = 375 males
* Female students over 16 = 1500 - 375 = 1125 females

4. For students under 16:
* Male students under 16 = 1/2 × 1500 = 750 males
* Female students under 16 = 1500 - 750 = 750 fe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16 years old, we have:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old

Similarly, since the remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, we also have:

3000 students / 2 = 1500 students under 16 years old

Next, let's find out how many of these students are male. Since one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, ...
