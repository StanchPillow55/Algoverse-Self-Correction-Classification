Final Answer: To find out how much John will pay for the grooming after the discount, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of the discount**: The groomer offers a 30% discount on the original grooming cost of $100.

   To calculate the discount amount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   Here, the original cost is $100 and the discount rate is 30%, which can be expressed as a decimal (30% = 0.30).

   Now, we calculate the discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the final cost after applying the discount**: To find the final cost that John will pay after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original cost.

   Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   We substitute the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Final Cost} = 100 - 30 = 70
   \]

3. **State the final answer**: The grooming cost after applying the 30% discount is $70.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The original cost of the grooming is $100. John is offered a 30% discount because he is a new customer. 

To find the amount of the discount, we need to calculate 30% of $100. 

To do this, we multiply the original cost by the discount rate (expressed as a decimal). 

So, $100 * 0.30 = $30. 

This means that the discount amount is $30. 

To find the final cost of the grooming, we subtract the discount from the original cost. 

So, $100 - $30 = $70. 

Therefore, the groomi...
