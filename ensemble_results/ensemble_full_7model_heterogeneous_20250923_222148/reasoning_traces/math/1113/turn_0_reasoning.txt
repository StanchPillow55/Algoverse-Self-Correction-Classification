=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow the changes in temperature step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The temperature starts at 2 degrees Celsius.

2. **Temperature Drop**: The temperature drops by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. We can calculate the new temperature after the drop as follows:

   \[
   \text{New Temperature} = \text{Initial Temperature} - \text{Drop}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Temperature} = 2 \, \text{degrees Celsius} - 8 \, \text{degrees Celsius}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Temperature} = 2 - 8 = -6 \, \text{degrees Celsius}
   \]

3. **Temperature Increase**: In the morning, the temperature increases by 3 degrees Celsius. We can calculate the final temperature after the increase as follows:

   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = \text{Temperature After Drop} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = -6 \, \text{degrees Celsius} + 3 \, \text{degrees Celsius}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Temperature} = -6 + 3 = -3 \, \text{degrees Celsius}
   \]

Thus, after considering the drop and the subsequent increase, the temperature in the morning is:

\[
\boxed{-3} \, \text{degrees Celsius}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow the changes in temperature step by step.

1. **Initial Temperature**: The temperature starts at 2 degrees Celsius.

2. **Temperature Drop**: The temperature drops by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. We can calculate the new temperature after the drop as follows:

   \[
   \text{New Temperature} = \text{Initial Temperature} - \text{Drop}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.
- The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight.
- The temperature then increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature after the overnight drop.
Initial temperature: 2 degrees Celsius
Temperature drop: 8 degrees Celsius
Temperature after the overnight drop = 2 degrees Celsius - 8 degrees Celsius = -6 degrees C...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the changes in temperature step by step, starting from the initial temperature.

1. **Initial Temperature:**
   - The initial temperature is given as 2 degrees Celsius.

2. **Temperature Drop Overnight:**
   - The temperature dropped by 8 degrees Celsius overnight. 
   - To find the new temperature after the drop, we subtract 8 degrees from the initial temperature:
     \[
     2 \, \text{degrees Celsius} - 8 \, \text{degrees Celsi...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial temperature:
* Starting at 2°C

2. Temperature drop overnight:
* Dropped 8°C
* 2°C - 8°C = -6°C
* Temperature is now -6°C

3. Temperature increase in morning:
* Increased 3°C
* -6°C + 3°C = -3°C
* Final temperature is -3°C

Reasoning:
* When temperature drops, we subtract
* When temperature increases, we add
* We follow the changes in order: first the drop, then the increase
* Negative temperatures are al...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem involves a series of temperature changes. 

We start with an initial temperature of 2 degrees Celsius. 

Overnight, the temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius. To find the new temperature, we subtract 8 from the initial temperature: 

2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius. 

So, the temperature is -6 degrees Celsius after the drop.

In the morning, the temperature increased by 3 degrees Celsius. To find the new temperature, we add 3 to the temperature after the drop:

-6 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial temperature and then apply the changes given in the question.

Given:
- The initial temperature was 2 degrees Celsius.
- The temperature dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight.
- The temperature increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature after the overnight drop.
Overnight temperature = Initial temperature - Temperature drop
Overnight temperatu...
