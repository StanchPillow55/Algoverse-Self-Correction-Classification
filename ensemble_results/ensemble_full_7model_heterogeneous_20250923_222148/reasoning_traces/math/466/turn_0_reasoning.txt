=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we will calculate the total cost for each person after applying their respective discounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost

1. **Cost per apple**: 45 cents
2. **Number of apples**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.45 \, \text{dollars} \times 20 = 9.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount**: $1
5. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost

1. **Cost per apple**: 50 cents
2. **Number of apples**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.50 \, \text{dollars} \times 20 = 10.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount**: 10 percent of the total cost
5. **Calculate the discount amount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 10\% \times \text{Total cost} = 0.10 \times 10.00 = 1.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in total costs

Now, we will find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Kelly's total cost} - \text{Becky's total cost} = 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Kelly paid **$1.00** more than Becky.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount.
- Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Becky's apples.
Total cost for Becky's apples = (20 apples × $0.45 per apple) - $1 discount
Total cost for Becky's apples = $9 - $1 = $8

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Kelly's apples.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount each person paid for their apples and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Becky before the discount.**

Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each. To find the total cost before the discount, we multiply the number of apples by the price per apple:

\[ \text{Total cost for Becky before discount} = 20 \times 45 \text{ cents} = 900 \text{ cents} \]

**Step 2: App...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

For Becky:
1. Initial cost = 20 apples × $0.45 per apple
   * 20 × $0.45 = $9.00
2. After $1 discount:
   * $9.00 - $1.00 = $8.00
Becky's final cost = $8.00

For Kelly:
1. Initial cost = 20 apples × $0.50 per apple
   * 20 × $0.50 = $10.00
2. 10% discount calculation:
   * 10% of $10.00 = $10.00 × 0.10 = $1.00
3. After 10% discount:
   * $10.00 - $1.00 = $9.00
Kelly's final cost = $9.00

Difference in cost:
* Kelly'...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Becky paid for her apples.

The cost of each apple is 45 cents, so the total cost for 20 apples would be 20 * 45 = 900 cents or $9. 

Becky received a $1 discount, so she paid 9 - 1 = $8.

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid for her apples.

The cost of each apple is 50 cents, so the total cost for 20 apples would be 20 * 50 = 1000 cents or $10.

Kelly received a 10 percent discount, so the discount amount would be 10/100 * 10 = $1.
