Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has.**
   - She has 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck.
   - Total basketball cards = Number of decks × Cards per deck
   \[
   \text{Total basketball cards} = 6 \times 25 = 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards Miss Maria has.**
   - She has 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box.
   - Total baseball cards = Number of boxes × Cards per box
   \[
   \text{Total baseball cards} = 5 \times 40 = 200
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards Miss Maria has.**
   - Total cards = Total basketball cards + Total baseball cards
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 150 + 200 = 350
   \]

4. **Determine how many cards Miss Maria keeps.**
   - She keeps 50 cards.
   - Therefore, the number of cards she gives away = Total cards - Cards kept
   \[
   \text{Cards given away} = 350 - 50 = 300
   \]

5. **Calculate how many students Miss Maria has.**
   - Each student receives 10 cards.
   - To find the number of students, we divide the total number of cards given away by the number of cards each student receives.
   \[
   \text{Number of students} = \frac{\text{Cards given away}}{\text{Cards per student}} = \frac{300}{10} = 30
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Miss Maria has **30 students**.
