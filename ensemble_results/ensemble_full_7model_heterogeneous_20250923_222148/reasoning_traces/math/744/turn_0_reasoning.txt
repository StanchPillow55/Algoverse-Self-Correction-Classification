=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many animals Melissa will groom each day of the week, we first need to calculate the total number of animals she has to groom. We will then divide that total by the number of days in the week to find out how many animals she will groom each day.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of animals

1. **Dogs**: 8
2. **Cats**: 5
3. **Birds**: 3
4. **Horses**: 12

Now, we add these numbers together to find the total:

\[
\text{Total animals} = \text{Dogs} + \text{Cats} + \text{Birds} + \text{Horses}
\]

\[
\text{Total animals} = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add the dogs and cats:
  \[
  8 + 5 = 13
  \]

- Next, add the birds:
  \[
  13 + 3 = 16
  \]

- Finally, add the horses:
  \[
  16 + 12 = 28
  \]

So, the total number of animals is **28**.

### Step 2: Divide the total number of animals by the number of days in the week

Melissa works over **7 days** in a week. To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

\[
\text{Animals per day} = \frac{\text{Total animals}}{\text{Days in a week}} = \frac{28}{7}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Animals per day} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Melissa will groom **4 animals each day** of the week.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of animals that need grooming:
* Dogs: 8
* Cats: 5
* Birds: 3
* Horses: 12
* Total = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals total

2. Since she needs to split the work evenly over the week:
* A week has 7 days
* To find animals per day: 28 รท 7 = 4

3. Let's verify:
* 4 animals per day ร 7 days = 28 animals total
* This matches our total number of animals

Therefore, Melissa will need to gr...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of animals that Melissa needs to groom. We do this by adding the number of each type of animal together:

8 dogs + 5 cats + 3 birds + 12 horses = 28 animals

Next, we need to determine how many days are in a week. There are 7 days in a week.

To find out how many animals Melissa will groom each day, we divide the total number of animals by the number of days in the week:

28 animals รท 7 days = 4 animals/day
