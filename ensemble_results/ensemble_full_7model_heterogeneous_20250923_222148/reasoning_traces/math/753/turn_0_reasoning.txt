=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has after accounting for the broken items.

1. **Calculate the initial quantities of glasses and plates:**
   - Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of glasses:
     \[
     8 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ glasses/dozen} = 96 \text{ glasses}
     \]
   - Jeff also sent 4 dozen plates. We calculate the total number of plates:
     \[
     4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ plates/dozen} = 48 \text{ plates}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of broken items:**
   - Jeff had 10 glasses broken.
   - Jeff had 6 plates broken.

3. **Calculate the remaining quantities of glasses and plates:**
   - To find the remaining glasses, we subtract the number of broken glasses from the initial number of glasses:
     \[
     96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ remaining glasses}
     \]
   - To find the remaining plates, we subtract the number of broken plates from the initial number of plates:
     \[
     48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ remaining plates}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Now we have:
     - Remaining glasses: 86
     - Remaining plates: 42

5. **State the final answer:**
   - Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.

Thus, the final answer is:
Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates remaining.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of glasses and plates Jeff has after the event.

Given information:
- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.
- 10 glasses were broken, and 6 plates were broken.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent for the party.
Number of glasses sent = 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
Number of plates sent = 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

Step 2: Calculate the number of glas...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has after accounting for the broken items.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Initial Number of Glasses:**
   - Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses to the event.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of glasses as follows:
     \[
     8 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ glasses per dozen} = 96 \text{ glasses}
     \]

2. **Determine the Initial Number of Plates:**
   - Jef...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's convert dozens to individual items:
* Glasses: 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses initially
* Plates: 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 plates initially

2. Now let's subtract the broken items:
* Glasses: 96 - 10 broken = 86 glasses remaining
* Plates: 48 - 6 broken = 42 plates remaining

Reasoning:
- Started with converting dozens to individual pieces since we need to work with individual broken items
- Then subtrac...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the dozens of glasses and plates into individual units. 

1 dozen is equal to 12 units. 

So, 8 dozen glasses is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
And, 4 dozen plates is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Jeff initially had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

Then, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken. 

So, the number of glasses remaining is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
And, the number of plates remaining is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has after the event, considering the broken items.

Given:
- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses to the event.
- Jeff sent 4 dozen plates to the event.
- 10 glasses were broken during the event.
- 6 plates were broken during the event.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses sent to the event.
8 dozen glasses = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses

Step 2: Calculate the total...
