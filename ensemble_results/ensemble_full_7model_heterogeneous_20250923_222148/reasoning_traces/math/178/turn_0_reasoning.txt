=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find the number of crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Step 2: Find the number of crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 10 = 46 crabs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.
Total crabs = Bo's crabs + Monic's crabs + Rani's crabs
Total crabs = 40 +

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Bo has 40 crabs.

Step 1: Find the number of crabs Monic has.
Bo has 40 crabs.
Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36 crabs

Step 2: Find the number of crabs Rani has.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic.
Rani's crabs = Monic's crabs + 10
Rani's crabs = 36 + 1...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of crabs each person has and then sum these amounts to find the total number of crabs.

1. **Determine the number of crabs Bo has:**
   - We are given that Bo has 40 crabs.

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
   - Since Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has \( 40 - 4 = 36 \) crabs.

3. **Determine the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.
   - Sin...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Bo has 40 crabs
* Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo
* Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic

2. Let's find how many crabs Monic has:
* Monic = Bo - 4
* Monic = 40 - 4
* Monic = 36 crabs

3. Now let's find how many crabs Rani has:
* Rani = Monic + 10
* Rani = 36 + 10
* Rani = 46 crabs

4. To find the total, add all three together:
* Total = Bo + Monic + Rani
* Total = 40 + 36 + 46
*...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs.

Second, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, we subtract 4 from the number of crabs Bo has to find out how many crabs Monic has:

40 (Bo's crabs) - 4 = 36 crabs (Monic's crabs)

Third, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we add 10 to the number of crabs Monic has to find out how many crabs Rani has:

36 (Monic's crabs) + 10 = 46 crabs (Rani's crabs)

Finally, to fin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of crabs Rani, Monic, and Bo have together.

Given:
- Bo has 40 crabs.
- Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo.
- Rani has ten more crabs than Monic.

Step 1: Calculate the number of crabs Monic has.
Monic's crabs = Bo's crabs - 4
Monic's crabs = 40 - 4 = 36

Step 2: C...
