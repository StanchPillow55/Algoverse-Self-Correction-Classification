=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's current age**:
   - We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's current age**:
   - We are told that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, we can calculate James's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{James's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine John's age**:
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. Since James is currently 18 years old, we can find John's current age by adding James's age to the age difference:
     \[
     \text{John's age} = 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son**:
   - We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. To find the age of the youngest son, we first calculate how many years ago John was 32:
     \[
     \text{Years ago when John was 32} = 37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years ago}
     \]
   - Since the youngest son was born 5 years ago, his current age is:
     \[
     \text{Youngest son's age} = 0 + 5 = 5 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine how old the youngest son will be in 3 years**:
   - To find out how old the youngest son will be in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Youngest son's age in 3 years} = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

Finally, we conclude that John's youngest son will be **8 years old** in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's current age**:
   - We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's current age**:
   - We are told that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, we can calculate James's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{James's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} = 2 \times 9 =...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John had a son James when he was 19 years old.
- James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
- Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
- John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.

Step 1: Find James's current age.
Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, so her current age is 12 - 3 = 9 years old.
James is twice as old as Dora, so James's current age is 2 × 9 = 18 years old.

Step 2: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of the individuals involved and then calculate the age of John's youngest son in 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's current age:**
   - We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's current age:**
   - James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James's age is:
   ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Dora's current age:
* We know Dora will be 12 in 3 years
* So Dora's current age = 12 - 3 = 9 years old

2. Now we can find James' age since he's twice Dora's age:
* James' current age = 2 × Dora's current age
* James' current age = 2 × 9 = 18 years old

3. Let's find John's current age:
* John was 19 when James was born
* John's current age = 19 + James' current age
* John's current age = 19 + ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. John had a son James when he was 19.
2. James is now twice as old as his sister Dora.
3. Dora will turn 12 in 3 years.
4. John's youngest son was born when John was 32.

From point 3, we can deduce that Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

From point 2, since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

From point 1, since John had James when he was 19 and James is now 18, John is c...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John had his son James when he was 19 years old.
   * James is currently twice as old as his sister Dora.
   * Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, which means she is currently 9 years old (12 - 3 = 9).
   * John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
   * We need to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

2. Calculate James' current age:
