=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
   - Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
   - Let \( J_b \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: 
     \[
     A = J_a + 8
     \]
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal: 
     \[
     B = \frac{1}{2} J_b
     \]
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples: 
     \[
     J_b = J_a + 4
     \]
   - Andrea has 52 apples: 
     \[
     A = 52
     \]

3. **Substituting Known Values:**
   Since \( A = 52 \), we can substitute this into the first equation:
   \[
   52 = J_a + 8
   \]
   To find \( J_a \):
   \[
   J_a = 52 - 8 = 44
   \]

4. **Finding Jamal's Bananas:**
   Now we can use the value of \( J_a \) to find \( J_b \):
   \[
   J_b = J_a + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
   \]

5. **Finding Andrea's Bananas:**
   Now we can find \( B \) using the relationship between Andrea's and Jamal's bananas:
   \[
   B = \frac{1}{2} J_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

6. **Calculating Total Fruits:**
   Now we can calculate the total number of fruits (apples and bananas) for both Andrea and Jamal:
   - Total fruits for Andrea:
     \[
     A + B = 52 + 24 = 76
     \]
   - Total fruits for Jamal:
     \[
     J_a + J_b = 44 + 48 = 92
     \]

7. **Final Total Fruits:**
   Now we add the total fruits of both Andrea and Jamal:
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 76 + 92 = 168
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{168}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
   - Let \( J_a \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples
- Andrea has 52 apples

Step 1: Find how many apples Jamal has.
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can subtract 8 from Andrea's 52 apples to find Jamal's number of apples.
Jamal's apples = Andrea's apples - 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples

Step 2: Find how...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of apples and bananas Andrea and Jamal each have, and then sum them to find the total number of fruits.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

We are given the following information:
1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: \( 52 = A + 8 \).
3. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
4. Jamal has 4 more...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Andrea has 52 apples
* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal
* Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal
* Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples

2. Let's find Jamal's number of apples:
* Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal
* Andrea has 52 apples
* So: Jamal's apples = Andrea's apples - 8
* Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples

3. Let's find Jamal's number of bananas:
* Jamal has ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many fruits each person has.

We know that Andrea has 52 apples. Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Since Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can add up all the fruits to find the total.

Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.

Jamal has 44 apples + 48 ba...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of fruits.

Given:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Step 1: Let's find the number of apples Jamal has.
Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples + 8
52 = Jam...
