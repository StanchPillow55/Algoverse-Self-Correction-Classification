=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total duration of Sarah's basketball game, we need to break down the components of the game and add them together.

1. **Calculate the duration of the regular quarters:**
   - Each quarter lasts 12 minutes.
   - There are 4 quarters in a game.

   To find the total time for the quarters, we multiply the number of quarters by the duration of each quarter:
   \[
   \text{Total time for quarters} = 4 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes/quarter} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Add the duration of the overtime:**
   - The game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter.

   Now, we add the overtime duration to the total time for the quarters:
   \[
   \text{Total game time} = \text{Total time for quarters} + \text{Overtime}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total game time} = 48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   The entire game lasted a total of 53 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{53 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total duration of the basketball game, including the regular game time and the extended time in the last quarter.

Given information:
- The basketball game has 4 quarters.
- Each quarter is 12 minutes long.
- The last quarter was extended for 5 minutes due to a tie.

Step 1: Calculate the total duration of the regular game time.
Duration of each quarter = 12 minutes
Total duration of the regular game = 4...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the total duration of Sarah's basketball game, we need to consider the length of each quarter and any additional time added due to the tie.

1. **Calculate the duration of the regular game:**
   - A standard basketball game consists of 4 quarters.
   - Each quarter is 12 minutes long.

   \[
   \text{Duration of regular game} = 4 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes per quarter} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Account for the overtime period:**
   - Si...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the regular game time:
* Each quarter is 12 minutes long
* There are 4 quarters
* Regular time = 12 minutes × 4 quarters
* Regular time = 48 minutes

2. Then add the extra time for the tie:
* Extra time = 5 minutes

3. Calculate total game time:
* Total time = Regular time + Extra time
* Total time = 48 minutes + 5 minutes
* Total time = 53 minutes

Reasoning: The game consists of the normal reg...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The basketball game is divided into 4 quarters, each lasting 12 minutes. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is 4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes.

However, the game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter. Therefore, the total time of the game is the sum of the time for the 4 quarters and the extra time.

So, the total time of the game is 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.

Therefore, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The basketball game has 4 quarters.
   * Each quarter is 12 minutes long.
   * The game was extended by 5 minutes due to a tie in the last quarter.

2. Calculate the total time for the 4 quarters:
   * Time for 1 quarter = 12 minutes
   * Time for 4 quarters = 12 minutes × 4
   * Time for 4 quarters = 48 minutes

3. Add the extra time due to the tie:
   * Extra time = ...
