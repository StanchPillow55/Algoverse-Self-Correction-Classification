Final Answer: To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Tuesday's Practice Hours:**
   Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday's hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
   \]

2. **Calculate Thursday's Practice Hours:**
   Hallie had dance practice for 2 hours on Thursdays.
   \[
   \text{Thursday's hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate Saturday's Practice Hours:**
   On Saturdays, Hallie's dance practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's class. Since Tuesday's class is 1 hour:
   \[
   \text{Saturday's hours} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday's hours} = 2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Weekly Practice Hours:**
   Now, we will add up all the hours from Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Tuesday's hours} + \text{Thursday's hours} + \text{Saturday's hours}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 1 \text{ hour} + 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, Hallie had a total of **5 hours** of dance practice in a week.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{5}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the dance practice times:
* Tuesday: 1 hour
* Thursday: 2 hours
* Saturday: Twice as long as Tuesday's class
   * Tuesday is 1 hour, so Saturday is 2 × 1 = 2 hours

2. Now let's add up all the hours:
* Tuesday: 1 hour
* Thursday: 2 hours
* Saturday: 2 hours
* Total = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week.

Final Answer: 5 hours

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Hallie had dance practice for 1 hour on Tuesdays and 2 hours on Thursdays. This means she had a total of 1 + 2 = <<1+2=3>>3 hours of dance practice on these two days.

On Saturdays, her dance practice lasted twice as long as Tuesday's night class. Since her Tuesday class was 1 hour, this means her Saturday class was 1 * 2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours long.

Adding up the hours from all three days, Hallie had a total of 3 (from Tuesday and Thursday) + 2 (from Saturday) = <<3+2=5>>5 ...
