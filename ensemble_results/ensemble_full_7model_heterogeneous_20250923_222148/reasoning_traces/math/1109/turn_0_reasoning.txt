Final Answer: To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the heights of the heels**: 
   - There are three women wearing 4-inch heels.
   - There are three women wearing 2-inch heels.

2. **Calculate the total height contributed by each group**:
   - For the women wearing 4-inch heels:
     \[
     \text{Total height from 4-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 4 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - For the women wearing 2-inch heels:
     \[
     \text{Total height from 2-inch heels} = 3 \text{ women} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total height of all the heels**:
   \[
   \text{Total height} = \text{Total height from 4-inch heels} + \text{Total height from 2-inch heels}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of women**:
   - There are a total of 3 women wearing 4-inch heels and 3 women wearing 2-inch heels:
   \[
   \text{Total number of women} = 3 + 3 = 6
   \]

5. **Calculate the average height of the heels**:
   The average height is calculated by dividing the total height by the total number of women:
   \[
   \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{\text{Total number of women}} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, the average height of the heels at the cocktail party is:

\[
\boxed{3 \text{ inches}}
\]
