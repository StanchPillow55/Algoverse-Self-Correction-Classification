=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Identify the probability of winning for each ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. In decimal form, this is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second ticket is described as being three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability for the second ticket:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of both tickets winning.

Given information:
- The first lottery ticket has a 20% chance of winning.
- The second lottery ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

Step 1: Find the probability of the second ticket winning.
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × Probability of the first ticket winning
Probability of the second ticket winning = 3 × 0.20 = 0.60 or 60%

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets are winners.

1. **Understanding the Probabilities:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculating the Probability of Both Tickets Winning:**
   - The p...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
   * First ticket has 20% chance of winning (0.20)
   * Second ticket is three times more likely to win than first ticket
   * We need to find probability of BOTH tickets winning

2) Calculate probability of second ticket:
   * Second ticket is 3 × 20%
   * 3 × 20% = 60% (0.60)

3) To find probability of BOTH tickets winning:
   * We multiply the individual probabilities
   * This is ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The probability of two independent events both happening is found by multiplying the probabilities of each event.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a decimal by dividing 20 by 100, which gives 0.20.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities together:

0.20 * 0...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mark buys two lottery tickets.
   * The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning.
   * The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket.

2. Calculate the probability of winning for the second ticket:
   * The second ticket is 3 times more likely to win than the first ticket.
   * Probability of winning for the second ticket = 3 × 20% = 60%
