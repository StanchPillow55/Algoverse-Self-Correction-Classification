=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of days Josh works in a week.**
   - Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Days he is closed: Sunday and Wednesday (2 days).
   - Therefore, the number of days he works in a week is:
     \[
     7 - 2 = 5 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars serviced in a week.**
   - Josh services 3 cars per day.
   - Over 5 working days, the total number of cars serviced in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Josh's earnings in a week.**
   - He earns $4 per car.
   - Therefore, his earnings for servicing 15 cars in a week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Josh's earnings in 2 weeks.**
   - Since he earns $60 in one week, in 2 weeks, he will earn:
     \[
     60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Josh makes in 2 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{120 \text{ dollars}}
\]

- Friday
- Saturday

This means Josh works 5 days a week.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of working days in two weeks

Since Josh works 5 days each week, in two...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's determine how many days per week Josh works
* There are 7 days in a week
* He doesn't work Sunday and Wednesday (2 days)
* So he works 5 days per week

2. Calculate how many cars he services per week
* He services 3 cars per day
* He works 5 days per week
* Cars per week = 3 cars × 5 days = 15 cars per week

3. Calculate how many cars he services in 2 weeks
* Cars per 2 weeks = 15 cars per week × 2 w...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Josh works 5 days a week (7 days in a week - 2 days off = 5 days). 

In one week, he services 15 cars (3 cars a day * 5 days a week = 15 cars). 

In two weeks, he services 30 cars (15 cars a week * 2 weeks = 30 cars). 

At $4 per car, he makes $120 in two weeks (30 cars * $4 per car = $120). 

So, Josh makes $120 in two weeks.

--- Model 7 Response ---

   * Josh services 3 cars per day.
   * He is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   * He gets paid $4 per car.
   * We need to calculate his earnings for 2 weeks.
