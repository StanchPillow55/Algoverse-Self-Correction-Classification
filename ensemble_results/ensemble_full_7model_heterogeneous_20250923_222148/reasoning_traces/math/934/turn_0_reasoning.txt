=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds and then find the average of those two distances.

**Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance.**

Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. To find the total distance she spits, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = 40 \text{ seeds} \times 10 \text{ feet/seed} = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Sydney's total distance.**

Sydney has 35 seeds and she spits each one 12 feet. Similarly, we calculate the total distance she spits:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per seed}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = 35 \text{ seeds} \times 12 \text{ feet/seed} = 420 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the average total distance spat.**

Now that we have the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney, we can find the average of these two distances. The average is calculated by adding the total distances and dividing by the number of participants (which is 2 in this case).

\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} + \text{Total distance spat by Sydney}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 \text{ feet} + 420 \text{ feet}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{820 \text{ feet}}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney is **410 feet**.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney in the watermelon seed spitting contest, we need to calculate the total distance each of them spits their seeds and then find the average of those two distances.

**Step 1: Calculate Zoey's total distance.**

Zoey has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. To find the total distance she spits, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spat:

\[
\text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = \text{...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance spat by each person and then find the average of the total distances.

Given information:
- Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet.
- Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance spat by Zoey.
Zoey's total distance = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
Zoey's total distance = 40 × 10 feet = 400 feet

Step 2:...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits their watermelon seeds and then find the average total distance spat by both Zoey and Sydney.

### Step 1: Calculate Zoey's Total Distance
Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each seed 10 feet. To find the total distance Zoey spits her seeds, we multiply the number of seeds by the distance each seed is spit:

\[
\text{Total distance for Zoey} = \text{Number of seeds} \times \text{Distance per s...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate Zoey's total distance:
* Zoey has 40 seeds and spits each one 10 feet
* Total distance = 40 seeds × 10 feet
* Zoey's total = 400 feet

2. Next, let's calculate Sydney's total distance:
* Sydney has 35 seeds and spits each one 12 feet
* Total distance = 35 seeds × 12 feet
* Sydney's total = 420 feet

3. To find the average total distance:
* Add both totals: 400 + 420 = 820 feet
* Divide by 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds. 

For Zoey, she spat 40 seeds each at a distance of 10 feet. So, the total distance she spat her seeds is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

For Sydney, she spat 35 seeds each at a distance of 12 feet. So, the total distance she spat her seeds is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

To find the average total distance spat, we add the total distances spat by both Zoey and Sydney and then divide ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Find the total distance Zoey's seeds traveled:
   * Zoey has 40 seeds, and she spits each one 10 feet.
   * Total distance for Zoey = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
   * Total distance for Zoey = 40 × 10 = 400 feet

2. Find the total distance Sydney's seeds traveled:
   * Sydney has 35 seeds, and she spits each one 12 feet.
   * Total distance for Sydney = Number of seeds × Distance per seed
   *...
