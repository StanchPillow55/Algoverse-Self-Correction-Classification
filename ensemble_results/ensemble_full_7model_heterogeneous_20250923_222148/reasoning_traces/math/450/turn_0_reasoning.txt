=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to compare the costs of two options: buying a movie super ticket with popcorn and soda, and buying a regular movie ticket with popcorn and soda.

1. **Cost of the Super Ticket Option:**
   - Super ticket price: $20
   - Popcorn and soda extra cost: $1
   - Total cost for the super ticket option:
     \[
     \text{Total cost (super ticket)} = 20 + 1 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of the Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Regular movie ticket price: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let \( p \) be the regular price of popcorn.
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option:
     \[
     \text{Total cost (regular ticket)} = 12 + 3 + p = 15 + p \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Savings Information:**
   - According to the problem, if you didn't buy the super ticket and ended up saving $2, it means the cost of the regular ticket option is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket option.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     15 + p = 21 - 2
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     15 + p = 19
     \]

4. **Solving for \( p \):**
   - To find the price of popcorn, we subtract 15 from both sides:
     \[
     p = 19 - 15
     \]
     \[
     p = 4
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \) dollars. 

This means that if you buy a regular movie ticket for $12, a soda for $3, and popcorn for $4, your total would be $19, which is indeed $2 less than the total cost of the super ticket option ($21).

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the regular price of popcorn given the conditions of the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Options

1. **Super Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the super ticket: $20
   - Additional cost for popcorn and soda: $1
   - Total cost for super ticket option: \(20 + 1 = 21\) dollars

2. **Regular Ticket Option:**
   - Cost of the regular movie ticket: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let \( p \) be the ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Super ticket: $20 + $1 for popcorn and soda combo
- Regular ticket: $12
- Regular soda price: $3
- You saved $2 by not buying super ticket

Let's solve:
1. Calculate total cost of super ticket option:
   * Super ticket + popcorn/soda combo
   * $20 + $1 = $21 total

2. Calculate total cost of regular option:
   * Regular ticket + regular soda + regular popcorn
   * $12 + $3 + x (where x is regul...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the price of popcorn as P.

If you buy a regular movie ticket, popcorn, and soda, you spend $12 (for the ticket) + P (for the popcorn) + $3 (for the soda). So, the total cost is $12 + P + $3 = $15 + P.

We know that this total cost is $2 less than the cost of the super ticket with popcorn and soda, which is $20 + $1 = $21.

So, we can set up the equation $15 + P = $21 - $2, which simplifies to $15 + P = $19.

Subtracting $15 from both sides of the equation gi...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A movie super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda for an extra $1.
   * A regular movie ticket costs $12.
   * A soda costs $3.
   * If you buy a regular ticket and popcorn with a soda at regular price, you save $2 compared to the super ticket.

2. Let's express the cost of the super ticket in terms of the regular prices:
   * Super ...
