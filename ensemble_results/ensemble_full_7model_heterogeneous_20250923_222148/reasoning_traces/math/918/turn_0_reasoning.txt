=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of students participating in the different sports, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of students playing tennis:**
   - We are given that there are 6 students playing tennis.

2. **Determine the number of students playing volleyball:**
   - The problem states that there are twice the number of students playing volleyball compared to those playing tennis. 
   - Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of students playing soccer:**
   - We are given that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer.
   - To find the total number of students playing soccer, we add the number of boys and girls:
     \[
     16 + 22 = 38
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Now, we will add the number of students from each sport:
     - Students playing tennis: 6
     - Students playing volleyball: 12
     - Students playing soccer: 38
   - Therefore, the total number of students is:
     \[
     6 + 12 + 38 = 56
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of students participating in tennis, volleyball, and soccer is:
     \[
     \boxed{56}
     \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many students are playing volleyball. Since the number of students playing volleyball is twice the number of students playing tennis, we multiply the number of tennis players by 2.

6 students (tennis) * 2 = 12 students (volleyball)

Next, let's find out how many students are playing soccer. Since there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer, we add these two numbers together.
