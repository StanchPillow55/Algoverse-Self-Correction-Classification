=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of books and the current unsold books**:
   - Total books = 250
   - Unsold books = 50
   - Therefore, the number of books sold so far = Total books - Unsold books = 250 - 50 = 200 books.

2. **Determine the number of books sold this year**:
   - Books sold this year = 45.

3. **Calculate the number of books sold in previous years**:
   - Since Elise has been selling books for three years, we can denote the number of books sold in the second year as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, she sold twice as many books in the first year as she sold this year. Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year = \( 2 \times 45 = 90 \).

4. **Set up the equation for total books sold**:
   - The total number of books sold over the three years can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Books sold in first year} + \text{Books sold in second year} + \text{Books sold in third year} = 200
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     90 + x + 45 = 200
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Combine the known quantities:
     \[
     135 + x = 200
     \]
   - Subtract 135 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 200 - 135 = 65
     \]
   - Thus, Elise sold 65 books in the second year.

6. **Calculate the total earnings from the second year**:
   - Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings from the second year can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = \text{Number of books sold in second year} \times \text{Price per book}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Earnings} = 65 \times 20 = 1300
     \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - The total amount of money Elise earned in the second year is **$1300**.

Thus, the final answer is \( \boxed{1300} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Elise sold in each of the three years and then calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Books Sold:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - Currently, there are 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total books: 250
* Price per book: $20
* Current (3rd year) sales: 45 books
* First year sales: Twice current year (2 Ã— 45 = 90 books)
* Remaining unsold books: 50
* Need to find: Second year sales amount

2. Let's find how many books were sold in the second year:
* Total books = First year + Second year + Third year + Unsold
* 250 = 90 + Second year + 45 + 50
* 250 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how many books Elise has sold in total over the three years. We know she started with 250 books and has 50 unsold books left, so she must have sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year and twice as many books in the first year, so she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

To find out how many books she sold in the second year, we subtract the number of books sold in the first and third years from the to...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elise has a total of 250 books to sell.
   * Each book sells for $20.
   * She sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current (third) year.
   * There are 50 unsold books.
   * She sold 45 books in the current (third) year.
