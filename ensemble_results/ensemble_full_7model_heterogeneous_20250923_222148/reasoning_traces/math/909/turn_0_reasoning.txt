=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information provided.

1. **Duncan's Current Age**: We know that Duncan is currently 60 years old.

2. **Duncan's Age Eight Years Ago**: 
   \[
   \text{Duncan's age eight years ago} = 60 - 8 = 52
   \]

3. **Adam's Age Four Years Ago**: Let's denote Adam's current age as \( A \). Therefore, Adam's age four years ago would be:
   \[
   \text{Adam's age four years ago} = A - 4
   \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation**: According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   52 = 2(A - 4)
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   - First, we expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     52 = 2A - 8
     \]
   - Next, we add 8 to both sides to isolate the term with \( A \):
     \[
     52 + 8 = 2A
     \]
     \[
     60 = 2A
     \]
   - Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

6. **Adam's Current Age**: We have determined that Adam is currently 30 years old.

7. **Calculating Adam's Age in 8 Years**: To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
   \[
   \text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Adam will be **38 years old** in 8 years.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we start by defining the ages of Duncan and Adam based on the information provided.

1. **Duncan's Current Age**: We know that Duncan is currently 60 years old.

2. **Duncan's Age Eight Years Ago**: 
   \[

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago.
- Duncan's age is 60 now.

Step 1: Find Duncan's age 8 years ago.
Duncan's age now - 8 years = Duncan's age 8 years ago
60 - 8 = 52 years old

Step 2: Find Adam's age 4 years ago.
Since Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago, we can use this equation:
Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 × Adam's age 4 years ago...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Adam's current age and then calculate how old he will be in 8 years. Let's break down the information given and solve the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent Duncan's current age.
   - Let \( A \) represent Adam's current age.

2. **Translate the problem into equations:**
   - We know Duncan's current age is 60, so \( D = 60 \).
   - Duncan's age eight years ago was \( D - 8 \).
   -...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's first find Duncan's age 8 years ago:
   * Duncan is 60 now
   * Duncan's age 8 years ago = 60 - 8 = 52 years old

2. We know Duncan's age 8 years ago (52) was two times Adam's age 4 years ago
   * 52 = 2 × (Adam's age 4 years ago)
   * Adam's age 4 years ago = 52 ÷ 2 = 26 years old

3. Now we can find Adam's current age:
   * Adam's age 4 years ago was 26
   * Adam's current age = 26 + 4 = 30 years old

4. ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Duncan's age eight years ago as D and Adam's age four years ago as A. 

From the problem, we know that D = 2A. 

We also know that Duncan's current age is 60, so eight years ago he was 60 - 8 = 52 years old. 

Substituting D = 52 into the equation D = 2A, we get 52 = 2A. 

Solving for A, we find that A = 52 / 2 = 26. 

So, Adam was 26 years old four years ago. 

Therefore, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30 years old. 

In 8 years, Adam will be 30 + 8 = 38 yea...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find Adam's age 8 years from now, given the information about Duncan's current age and their ages in the past.

Given:
- Duncan's age now is 60.
- Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago.

Step 1: Calculate Duncan's age 8 years ago.
Duncan's age 8 years ago = Current age - 8
Duncan's age 8 years ago = 60 - 8 = 52

Step 2: Express Adam's age 4 years ago in terms of Duncan's...
