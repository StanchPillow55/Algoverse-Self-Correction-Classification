=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vet visit, which includes the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Then, we will determine how much money John has left after paying the bill.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20.
   - Total cost for vaccines = Number of vaccines × Cost per vaccine
   \[
   \text{Total cost for vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Let the total bill be represented as \( T \).**
   - The heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, we can express the cost of the heartworm check as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6T
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill \( T \) consists of the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   T = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   T = 40 + 0.6T
   \]

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   - Rearranging the equation to isolate \( T \):
   \[
   T - 0.6T = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4T = 40
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how much John has left after paying the bill:**
   - John brought $125 with him.
   - To find out how much he leaves with, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = \text{Amount brought} - T
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after paying the vet bill, John leaves with **$25**.

Final answer: John leaves with **$25**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which are $20 each.
- The dog also needs a heartworm check.
- The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
- John brought $125 with him.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 2 vaccines.
Cost of 2 vaccines = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check.
The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
Let's call the total bill "x".

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* 2 vaccines at $20 each
* Heartworm check is 60% of total bill
* John brought $125

2. Calculate cost of vaccines:
* 2 × $20 = $40 for vaccines

3. Let's find the total bill:
* Let x = total bill
* Heartworm check is 60% of x = 0.60x
* Vaccines ($40) + Heartworm check (0.60x) = x
* $40 + 0.60x = x
* $40 = x - 0.60x
* $40 = 0.40x
* x = $40 ÷ 0.40
* x = $100 total bill

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The problem states that the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. This means that the cost of the vaccines is the remaining 40% of the total bill. 

We can set up the equation 40/100 * total bill = cost of vaccines to find the total bill. Plugging in the known values, we get 40/100 * total bill = $40. Solving fo...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John's dog needs 2 vaccines, which cost $20 each.
   * The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.
   * John brought $125 with him.

2. Calculate the cost of the vaccines:
   * Cost of 1 vaccine = $20
   * Cost of 2 vaccines = $20 × 2 = $40

3. Let's express the total bill in terms of the heartworm check cost:
   * Let the cost of the heartworm check be x.
