=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students at the grade level based on the information given about the proportion of students who have desktop computers.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that three-fourths (or \( \frac{3}{4} \)) of the students have a desktop computer. This implies that one-fourth (or \( \frac{1}{4} \)) of the students do not have a desktop computer.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( x \) represent the total number of students at the grade level. According to the problem, the number of students who do not have desktop computers is given as 20. Since one-fourth of the total students do not have desktop computers, we can express this relationship mathematically as:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} x = 20
   \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   x = 20 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   x = 80
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The total number of students at that grade level is 80.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of students at the given grade level.

Given information:
- Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.
- 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Step 1: Represent the fraction of students who have a desktop computer.
Three-fourths = 3/4

Step 2: Find the fraction of students who do not have a desktop computer.
Fraction of students without a desktop computer = 1 - 3/4 = 1/4...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students at a certain grade level, given that three-fourths of them have a desktop computer at home and 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of students at the grade level.

2. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home. Therefore, the ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Three-fourths (3/4) of students have desktop computers
* 20 students do NOT have desktop computers

Step 1: Identify what fraction does NOT have computers
* If 3/4 have computers
* Then 1/4 do NOT have computers

Step 2: Set up an equation
* 1/4 of total students = 20 students
* Let x = total number of students
* 1/4x = 20

Step 3: Solve for x
* Multiply both sides by 4 to isolate x
* 4 × (1/4x) = 4 × 20
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that three-fourths of students have a desktop computer at home. This implies that one-fourth of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. 

We are told that 20 students do not have a desktop computer, which represents one-fourth of the total number of students. 

To find the total number of students, we need to multiply the number of students without a desktop computer by 4 (since they represent one-fourth of the total). 

So, 20 students * 4...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Three-fourths (3/4) of the students have a desktop computer at home.
   * 20 students do not have desktop computers.

2. Let's define a variable for the total number of students:
   * Let x be the total number of students at that grade level.

3. If 20 students do not have desktop computers, then these 20 students represent one-fourth (1/4) of the total students....
