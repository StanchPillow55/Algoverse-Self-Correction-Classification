=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left after selling and receiving returns, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initial Number of Loaves**: 
   The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

2. **Loaves Sold in the Morning**: 
   They sold 93 loaves in the morning. 
   To find the remaining loaves after the morning sales, we subtract the number of loaves sold from the initial amount:
   \[
   200 - 93 = 107
   \]
   So, after the morning sales, they had 107 loaves left.

3. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon**: 
   They sold an additional 39 loaves in the afternoon. 
   We again subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon from the remaining loaves after the morning:
   \[
   107 - 39 = 68
   \]
   After the afternoon sales, they had 68 loaves left.

4. **Returns from the Grocery Store**: 
   The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. 
   To find the total number of loaves after receiving the returns, we add the returned loaves to the remaining loaves:
   \[
   68 + 6 = 74
   \]

5. **Final Count of Loaves**: 
   Therefore, the total number of loaves of bread they had left after all sales and returns is 74.

In conclusion, the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had **74 loaves of bread left**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery started with 200 loaves of bread.

They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. To find out how many loaves they sold in total, we add these two numbers together:

93 loaves + 39 loaves = 132 loaves

So, they sold 132 loaves of bread in total.

To find out how many loaves they had left after selling, we subtract the number of loaves sold from the number they started with:

200 loaves - 132 loaves = 68 loaves
