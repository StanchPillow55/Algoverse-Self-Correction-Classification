=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much William spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - William bought 5 notebooks.
   - The price of each notebook is $1.50.
   - To find the total cost for the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks by the price per notebook:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = \text{Number of notebooks} \times \text{Price per notebook}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 5 \times 1.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 7.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the ballpen:**
   - William bought 1 ballpen.
   - The price of each ballpen is $0.50.
   - To find the total cost for the ballpen, we multiply the number of ballpens by the price per ballpen:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = \text{Number of ballpens} \times \text{Price per ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 1 \times 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ballpen} = 0.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the notebooks and the total cost of the ballpen together:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of ballpen}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 7.50 + 0.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 8.00
   \]

Therefore, William spent a total of **$8.00**. 

Final answer: **$8.00**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Notebooks cost $1.50 each
* Ballpen costs $0.50 each
* William bought 5 notebooks and 1 ballpen

Step 1: Calculate cost of notebooks
* Cost of notebooks = Number of notebooks × Price per notebook
* Cost of notebooks = 5 × $1.50
* Cost of notebooks = $7.50

Step 2: Calculate cost of ballpen
* Cost of ballpen = Number of ballpens × Price per ballpen
* Cost of ballpen = 1 × $0.50
* Cost of ballpen = $0.50

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Since each notebook costs $1.50 and William bought 5, we multiply $1.50 by 5. 

$1.50 * 5 = $7.50

Next, we add the cost of the ballpen. Since the ballpen costs $0.5, we add this to the total cost of the notebooks.

$7.50 + $0.5 = $8.00

So, William spent a total of $8.00 for five notebooks and a ballpen.
