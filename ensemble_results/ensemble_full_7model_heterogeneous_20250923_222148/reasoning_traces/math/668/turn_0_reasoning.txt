Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of employees**: 
   The problem states that there are 50 employees in total.

2. **Calculate the number of management employees**: 
   We know that 20% of the employees are management. To find the number of management employees, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of management employees} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Percentage of management}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of management employees} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 management employees.

3. **Determine how many of the management employees oversee the entire company**: 
   According to the problem, 30% of the management employees oversee the entire company. We can calculate this using the same formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = \text{Number of management employees} \times \text{Percentage overseeing}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of employees overseeing the company} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3
   \]
   Thus, 3 employees oversee the entire company.

4. **Final answer**: 
   The final answer is that **3 employees oversee the company**.

In summary, we calculated the number of management employees from the total, then determined how many of those management employees oversee the entire company, arriving at the final answer of 3.
