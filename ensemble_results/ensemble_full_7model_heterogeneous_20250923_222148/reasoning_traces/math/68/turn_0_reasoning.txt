=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of boys and girls**: 
   We know from the problem statement that there are 60 girls at Dr. Wertz's school. According to the problem, there are twice as many boys as girls. 

   Let's denote the number of girls as \( G \) and the number of boys as \( B \). We have:
   \[
   G = 60
   \]
   Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can express the number of boys as:
   \[
   B = 2G = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of students**: 
   The total number of students \( T \) is the sum of the number of boys and girls:
   \[
   T = G + B = 60 + 120 = 180
   \]

3. **Determine the number of teachers**: 
   The problem states that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers \( N \), we can use the total number of students and divide it by the number of students per teacher:
   \[
   N = \frac{T}{5} = \frac{180}{5}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   N = 36
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school is:
   \[
   \boxed{36}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school.
- There are 60 girls.
- There are 5 students for every teacher.

Step 1: Find the number of boys.
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys as follows:
Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
Number of boys = 2 × 60 = 120 boys

Step 2: Find the total number of students.
Total number of student...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school based on the given information. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Boys

We are told that there are twice as many boys as girls at the school. We know the number of girls is 60. Therefore, the number of boys can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
\]

### Step 2: Calcula...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of boys
* We know there are twice as many boys as girls
* Number of girls = 60
* So, number of boys = 60 × 2 = 120 boys

2. Now let's find the total number of students
* Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys
* Total students = 60 + 120 = 180 students

3. Finally, let's find the number of teachers
* We know there are 5 students for every 1 teacher
* To find number of teache...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of students at Dr. Wertz's school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls, there are 2 * 60 = <<2*60=120>>120 boys.

So, the total number of students is 60 girls + 120 boys = <<60+120=180>>180 students.

If there are 5 students for every teacher, we can find the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by the number of students per teacher. 

So, 180 students / 5 students/teacher =...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are twice as many boys as girls at the school.
   * There are 60 girls.
   * There are 5 students per teacher.

2. Find the number of boys:
   * Number of boys = 2 × Number of girls
   * Number of boys = 2 × 60
   * Number of boys = 120

3. Find the total number of students:
   * Total students = Number of girls + Number of boys
   * Total students = 60 + 1...
