Final Answer: To determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pen pals Mike has left**:
   - Mike originally had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, the number of pen pals he has left is:
     \[
     5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of letters received per week**:
   - Each of the 3 remaining pen pals sends 2 letters a week.
   - Thus, the total number of letters Mike receives per week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ pen pals} \times 2 \text{ letters/pen pal} = 6 \text{ letters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages received per week**:
   - Each letter is 5 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages Mike receives per week is:
     \[
     6 \text{ letters} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 30 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of pages Mike writes in response**:
   - Mike responds in kind, meaning he writes the same number of pages he receives.
   - Thus, he writes 30 pages in response each week.

5. **Calculate the time taken to write the pages**:
   - Mike can write 1 page in 6 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time he spends writing 30 pages is:
     \[
     30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert the total writing time from minutes to hours**:
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour. To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time Mike spends writing letters each week is:

\[
\boxed{3} \text{ hours}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Mike spends writing letters each week. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pen pals Mike currently has:**
   - Initially, Mike had 5 pen pals.
   - He stopped being pen pals with 2 of them.
   - Therefore, he currently has \(5 - 2 = 3\) pen pals.

2. **Calculate the number of letters Mike receives and sends:**

   - Since he has ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify how many pen pals Mike currently has:
* Started with 5 pen pals
* Stopped with 2 pen pals
* Current pen pals = 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals

2. Calculate letters received per week:
* Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week
* Total letters received = 3 pen pals Ã— 2 letters = 6 letters received

3. Calculate pages Mike needs to write in response:
* Each letter is 5 pages long
* Mike responds in kind (writ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many letters Mike is writing each week. He was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them, so he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends him 2 letters a week, and he responds to each letter with a letter of his own. So, he writes 3 people * 2 letters/person = <<3*2=6>>6 letters a week.

Each of these letters is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 letters * 5 pages/letter = <<6*5=30>...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but stopped being penpals with 2 of them.
- Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, and each letter is 5 pages long.
- Mike responds in kind, meaning he sends the same number of letters and pages.
- Mike can write a page every 6 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pen pals Mike currently has.
Initial pen pals = 5
Pen pals he stopped writing to =...
