=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hat**: 
   The problem states that the cost of the hat is $25.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Hat} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket**: 
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of Jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of Hat} = 3 \times 25 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the Pants**: 
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we first need to add the costs of the hat and jacket and then divide by 2.

   \[
   \text{Average Cost} = \frac{\text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of Each Uniform**: 
   Now that we have the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants, we can find the total cost of each uniform by adding these three costs together.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket} + \text{Cost of Pants}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:

\[
\boxed{150} \text{ dollars}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hat**: 
   The problem states that the cost of the hat is $25.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Hat} = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket**: 
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of Jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of Hat} = 3 \times 2...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The hat costs $25.
- The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
- The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the jacket.
Cost of the jacket = 3 × Cost of the hat
Cost of the jacket = 3 × $25 = $75

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pants.
Cost of the pants = (Cost of the hat + Cost of the jacket) / 2
Cost of the pants = ($25...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of each uniform, which includes the cost of a hat, a jacket, and pants. We'll calculate each component step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hat:**
   - The cost of the hat is given as $25.

2. **Cost of the Jacket:**
   - The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jacket is \(3 \times 25 = 75\) dollars.

3. **Cost of the Pants:**
   - The pants cost the average of the costs of the...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the cost of the hat:
* Hat = $25

2. Next, find the cost of the jacket which is three times the hat:
* Jacket = 3 × $25
* Jacket = $75

3. Now, find the cost of the pants which is the average of hat and jacket:
* Pants = (Hat + Jacket) ÷ 2
* Pants = ($25 + $75) ÷ 2
* Pants = $100 ÷ 2
* Pants = $50

4. Finally, calculate the total cost by adding all pieces:
* Total = Hat + Jacket + Pants
* To...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to determine the cost of each item. 

We know that the hat costs $25. 

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so we multiply the cost of the hat by 3 to find the cost of the jacket. 

25 * 3 = $75

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average of two numbers, we add them together and then divide by 2. 

So, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket together:

25 + 75 = $100

Then we divide this sum by 2 to ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each hat costs $25.
   * The jacket costs three times as much as the hat.
   * The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket costs.

2. Calculate the cost of the jacket:
   * Jacket cost = 3 × Hat cost
   * Jacket cost = 3 × $25
   * Jacket cost = $75

3. Calculate the cost of the pants:
   * Pants cost = (Hat cost + Jacket cost) ÷ 2
   * Pants cost = ($25 + $75) ÷ ...
