Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much cake remains after Rory and her mom each take a piece from the original cake.

1. **Identify the total weight of the cake**: 
   The total weight of the cake is given as 20 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of pieces**: 
   The cake is cut into 8 pieces.

3. **Calculate the weight of each piece**: 
   To find the weight of each piece, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{\text{Total weight of cake}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pieces are taken**: 
   Rory and her mom each take one piece, so a total of 2 pieces are taken.

5. **Calculate the total weight of the pieces taken**: 
   To find the total weight of the pieces taken, we multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces taken:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of pieces taken} = \text{Weight of each piece} \times \text{Number of pieces taken} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining weight of the cake**: 
   To find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight of cake} = \text{Total weight of cake} - \text{Total weight of pieces taken} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, the remaining weight of the cake after Rory and her mom each take a piece is **15 ounces**.

Final answer: **15 ounces**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cake weighs 20 ounces.
- The cake is cut into 8 pieces.
- Rory and her mom each have one piece.

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to calculate the weight of the two pieces that were eaten.

Step 1: Calculate the weight of one piece of the cake.
Weight of the cake / Number of pieces = Weight of one piece
20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Step 2: Calculate the wei...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of the remaining cake after Rory and her mom each have a piece. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the weight of each piece of cake:**
   - The total weight of the cake is 20 ounces.
   - The cake is cut into 8 equal pieces.
   - To find the weight of each piece, divide the total weight by the number of pieces:
     \[
     \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Find the weight of each piece:
* Total cake weight = 20 ounces
* Number of pieces = 8
* Weight per piece = 20 ÷ 8 = 2.5 ounces per piece

2. Calculate how many pieces were eaten:
* Rory ate 1 piece
* Her mom ate 1 piece
* Total pieces eaten = 2 pieces

3. Calculate weight of eaten cake:
* Weight of eaten cake = 2 pieces × 2.5 ounces per piece
* Weight of eaten cake = 5 ounces

4. Calculate remaining cake weight:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much each piece of cake weighs. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces. 

So, 20 ounces ÷ 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece.

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. 

To find out how much these 2 pieces weigh, we multiply the number of pieces by the weight of each piece. 

So, 2 pieces × 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces.

To find out how much the remaining cake weighs, we subtract th...
