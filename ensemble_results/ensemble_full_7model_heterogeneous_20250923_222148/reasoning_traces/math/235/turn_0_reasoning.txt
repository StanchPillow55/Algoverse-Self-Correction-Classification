=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of slices needed**: 
   John has 20 friends and each friend wants to have 4 slices. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of slices required as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = \text{Number of friends} \times \text{Slices per friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. **Determine how many slices are in one pizza**: 
   Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions. Therefore, the number of slices per pizza is:

   \[
   \text{Slices per pizza} = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pizzas needed**: 
   To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza:

   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices needed}}{\text{Slices per pizza}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pizzas needed} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Since the result is a whole number, John needs to order exactly 10 pizzas.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of slices required and then determine the minimum number of pizzas needed to provide those slices.

Given information:
- There are 20 friends in total.
- Each friend should have 4 slices.
- Pizzas are sold sliced into 8 portions.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices required.
Total number of slices required = Number of friends × Number of slices per friend
Total number of slices required...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas John should order to ensure that each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices of pizza. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Slices Needed:**
   - Each friend needs 4 slices.
   - There are 20 friends.
   - Therefore, the total number of slices needed is calculated by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices each friend needs:
     \[
     \text{Total slic...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many total slices are needed:
* Number of friends = 20
* Slices per friend = 4
* Total slices needed = 20 × 4 = 80 slices

2. Now, we know:
* Each pizza has 8 slices
* We need 80 total slices
* To find number of pizzas, divide total slices needed by slices per pizza
* 80 ÷ 8 = 10

3. Check our logic:
* 10 pizzas × 8 slices = 80 total slices
* 80 slices ÷ 20 friends = 4 slices per friend...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since he has 20 friends and he wants each of them to have 4 slices, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:

20 friends * 4 slices/friend = 80 slices

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas John needs to order. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 20 friends in total.
   * Each friend should get 4 slices of pizza.
   * Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

2. Calculate the total number of slices needed:
   * Total friends = 20
   * Slices per friend = 4
   * Total slices needed = Total friends × Slices per friend
   * Total slices needed = 20 × 4 = 80 slices

3. Calculate the number of pizzas needed:
