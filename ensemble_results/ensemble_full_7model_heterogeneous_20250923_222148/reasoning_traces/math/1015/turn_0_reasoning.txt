Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.**
2. **Determine how many packs Anne kept.**
3. **Calculate how many packs she gave away.**
4. **Find out how many pieces of sweets were given to her friends.**
5. **Calculate how many pieces each friend received.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of sweets in the box.

Anne purchased a box that contains 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces. 

To find the total number of pieces, we multiply the number of packs by the number of pieces per pack:

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 15 \times 60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
15 \times 60 = 900
\]

So, the total number of pieces of sweets in the box is **900 pieces**.

### Step 2: Determine how many packs Anne kept.

Anne kept 2 packs for herself. 

### Step 3: Calculate how many packs she gave away.

To find out how many packs she gave away, we subtract the number of packs she kept from the total number of packs:

\[
\text{Packs given away} = \text{Total packs} - \text{Packs kept} = 15 - 2
\]

Calculating this:

\[
15 - 2 = 13
\]

So, Anne gave away **13 packs**.

### Step 4: Find out how many pieces of sweets were given to her friends.

Now, we need to calculate how many pieces of sweets are in the 13 packs that she gave away. We do this by multiplying the number of packs given away by the number of pieces per pack:

\[
\text{Pieces given away} = \text{Packs given away} \times \text{Pieces per pack} = 13 \times 60
\]

Calculating this:

\[
13 \times 60 = 780
\]

So, Anne gave away **780 pieces** of sweets.

### Step 5: Calculate how many pieces each friend received.

Anne gave the 780 pieces equally to her 10 friends. To find out how many pieces each friend received, we divide the total pieces given away by the number of friends:

\[
\text{Pieces per friend} = \frac{\text{Pieces given away}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{780}{10}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{780}{10} = 78
\]

Thus, each friend received **78 pieces** of sweets.

### Final Answer

Each of Anne's friends received **78 pieces** of sweets.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of pieces in the box
* 15 packs × 60 pieces per pack = 900 total pieces

2. Anne kept 2 packs for herself
* 2 packs × 60 pieces per pack = 120 pieces kept by Anne

3. Calculate remaining pieces to give to friends
* Total pieces - Pieces Anne kept = Pieces to share
* 900 - 120 = 780 pieces to share

4. Divide remaining pieces equally among 10 friends
* 780 ÷ 10 = 78 pieces per fr...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. She kept two packs for herself, so she gave away 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs.

Next, let's find out how many pieces of sweets are in those 13 packs. Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.

Finally, let's divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received. There are 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces per friend.
