=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Jessica will pay on all her debts each month, we first need to calculate the total minimum payments for each of her debts and then find out how much she will pay if she decides to pay 50% more than the minimum.

1. **Identify the minimum payments:**
   - Student loans: $300/month
   - Credit card: $200/month
   - Mortgage: $500/month

2. **Calculate the total minimum payment:**
   \[
   \text{Total minimum payment} = \text{Student loans} + \text{Credit card} + \text{Mortgage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total minimum payment} = 300 + 200 + 500 = 1000 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

3. **Calculate 50% more than the minimum payment:**
   To find out how much Jessica wants to pay, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and then add that to the total minimum payment.
   \[
   \text{50% of total minimum payment} = 0.5 \times 1000 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total payment per month} = \text{Total minimum payment} + \text{50% of total minimum payment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total payment per month} = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total payment in a year:**
   To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply her monthly payment by the number of months in a year (12).
   \[
   \text{Total payment in a year} = \text{Total payment per month} \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total payment in a year} = 1500 \times 12 = 18000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jessica will pay **$18,000** in a year.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the minimum monthly payments:
* Student loans: $300/month
* Credit card: $200/month
* Mortgage: $500/month

2. Calculate total minimum monthly payment:
* $300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000 per month minimum

3. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum
* 50% = 0.5
* Additional payment = $1,000 Ã— 0.5 = $500 extra per month
* New monthly payment = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500 per month

4. Calculate a...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out the total minimum payment for all of Jessica's debts. We do this by adding together the minimum payments for her student loans, credit card, and mortgage.

$300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000

So, the total minimum payment for all of Jessica's debts is $1000 per month.

Next, we need to figure out how much Jessica wants to pay each month. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, so we need to calculate 50% of...
