=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine each received from their mother as \( x \). Since they both received the same amount, together they have:

\[
2x
\]

They spent their combined allowance on the following items:

1. A cake that costs $11.
2. A dozen balloons, which cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, we can calculate the cost of the dozen balloons as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of 1 balloon} = \frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of 12 balloons} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

3. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream, with each tub costing $7. Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is:

\[
\text{Cost of 2 tubs of ice cream} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount spent on all items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cake} + \text{Cost of balloons} + \text{Cost of ice cream}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to cover this total cost, we set up the equation:

\[
2x = 28
\]

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
\]

Thus, each girl received:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]

So, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

They spent their combined allowance on the following items:

1. A cake that costs $11.
2. A dozen balloons, which cost $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since there are 12 balloons in a dozen, we can calculate the cost of the dozen balloons as follows:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had, and then calculate the amount of allowance their mother gave to each of them.

Given information:
- Julia and Nadine were given the same amount of allowance by their mother.
- They bought a cake for $11.
- They bought 1 dozen balloons, which were sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons.
- They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the balloons....

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much allowance each of Julia and Nadine received from their mother. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Purchases:**
   - They bought a cake for $11.
   - They bought 1 dozen (12) balloons. The cost is $0.5 for 2 balloons. Therefore, the cost for 12 balloons is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon pair} = \$0.5
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of pairs in 12 balloons} = ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total cost of all items they bought:
   * Cake: $11
   * Balloons: 1 dozen = 12 balloons
     * 2 balloons cost $0.5
     * So 12 balloons cost: (12 ÷ 2) × $0.5 = 6 × $0.5 = $3
   * Ice cream: 2 tubs at $7 each
     * Total ice cream cost: 2 × $7 = $14

2. Calculate total spent:
   * Total = Cake + Balloons + Ice cream
   * Total = $11 + $3 + $14 = $28

3. Since Julia and Nadine combined the...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the balloons. Since a dozen is 12 and the balloons are sold for $0.5 for 2, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the price of 2 balloons by 6 (since a dozen is 12 and 12 divided by 2 is 6). 

$0.5 * 6 = $3

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Since each tub costs $7 and they bought 2 tubs, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the price of one tub by 2.

$7 * 2 = $14

Now, let's calculate the t...

   * Julia and Nadine received the same amount of allowance from their mother.
   * They combined their allowance to buy a cake, balloons, and ice cream.
   * The cake costs $11.
   * The balloons are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, and they bought 1 dozen (12) balloons.
