=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the number of clay dishes made by each person based on the information given.

1. **Identify Kora's contribution:**
   - Kora made 20 dishes. 
   - Let \( K = 20 \).

2. **Determine Rory's contribution:**
   - According to the problem, Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora.
   - Therefore, we can express Rory's dishes as:
   \[
   R = K + 20
   \]
   Substituting \( K = 20 \):
   \[
   R = 20 + 20 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine Jada's contribution:**
   - The problem states that Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
   - Thus, we can express Jada's dishes as:
   \[
   J = 2R
   \]
   Substituting \( R = 40 \):
   \[
   J = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of dishes made by all three:**
   - Now we have:
     - Kora: \( K = 20 \)
     - Rory: \( R = 40 \)
     - Jada: \( J = 80 \)
   - The total number of dishes made by all three is:
   \[
   \text{Total} = K + R + J = 20 + 40 + 80
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 140
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora together is \( \boxed{140} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
- Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
- Kora made 20 dishes.

Step 1: Find the number of clay dishes Rory made.
Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
Kora made 20 dishes.
Therefore, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 clay dishes.

Step 2: Find the number of clay dishes Jada made.
Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
Rory made 40...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many clay dishes each person made and then sum them up to find the total number of dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the number of dishes Kora made:**
   - According to the problem, Kora made 20 dishes.

2. **Determine the number of dishes Rory made:**
   - The problem states that Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
   - Since Kora made 20 dishes, Rory made...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Kora made 20 dishes
* Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora
* Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory

2. Let's find how many dishes Rory made:
* Rory = Kora + 20
* Rory = 20 + 20
* Rory = 40 dishes

3. Now let's find how many dishes Jada made:
* Jada = 2 × Rory
* Jada = 2 × 40
* Jada = 80 dishes

4. To find the total dishes, add all three together:
* Total = Kora + Rory + Jada
*...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many clay dishes Rory made. According to the problem, Rory made 20 more dishes than Kora. Since Kora made 20 dishes, we can add 20 to that number to find out how many dishes Rory made. 

20 (Kora's dishes) + 20 = 40 dishes (Rory's dishes)

Next, we need to find out how many dishes Jada made. The problem tells us that Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory. So, we can multiply the number of dishes Rory made by 2 to find out how many dishes J...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of clay dishes made by Jada, Rory, and Kora.

Given:
- Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory.
- Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora.
- Kora made 20 dishes.

Step 1: Determine the number of clay dishes made by Kora.
Kora's dishes = 20

Step 2: Calculat...
