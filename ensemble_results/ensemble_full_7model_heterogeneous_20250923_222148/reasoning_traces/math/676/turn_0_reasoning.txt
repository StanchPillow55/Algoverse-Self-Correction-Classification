=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dylan's Investment**:
   - The total amount invested in the joint savings account is $1200.
   - Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount.
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

2. **Calculate the Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment**:
   - After Dylan's investment, we need to find out how much money is left.
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

3. **Determine Frances's Investment**:
   - Frances invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount.
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

4. **Calculate the Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment**:
   - Now we find out how much money is left after Frances's investment.
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount after Frances} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

5. **Determine Skyler's Investment**:
   - Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments.
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount of money that Skyler invested is:
   \[
   \boxed{240}
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total investment = $1200
* Dylan invested 2/5 of total
* Frances invested 2/3 of what remained after Dylan
* Skyler invested whatever was left

2. Calculate Dylan's investment:
* Dylan = 2/5 × $1200
* Dylan = $480

3. Calculate what remained after Dylan:
* Remaining after Dylan = $1200 - $480
* Remaining after Dylan = $720

4. Calculate Frances's investment:
* Frances = 2/3 ×...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find out how much Dylan invested. We know that Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount, which is $1200. So, we multiply $1200 by 2/5:

$1200 * 2/5 = $480

This means Dylan invested $480.

Next, we need to find out how much money was left after Dylan's investment. We subtract Dylan's investment from the total amount:

$1200 - $480 = $720

So, there was $720 left after Dylan's investment.

Then, we need to find ou...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total investment is $1200.
   * Dylan invested 2/5 of the total amount.
   * Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount after Dylan's investment.
   * Skyler invested the rest of the money.

2. Calculate Dylan's investment:
   * Dylan's investment = 2/5 × $1200
   * Dylan's investment = $480

3. Calculate the remaining amount after Dylan's investment:
   * Remain...
