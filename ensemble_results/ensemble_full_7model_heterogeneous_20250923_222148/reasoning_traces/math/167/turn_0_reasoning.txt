=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables**:
   - Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.
   - Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

2. **Translate the information into equations**:
   - From the problem, we know that "Seth is twice as old as Brooke." This can be expressed as:
     \[
     S = 2B
     \]
   - The second piece of information states that "In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28." In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation gives:
     \[
     S + B + 4 = 28
     \]
   - Subtracting 4 from both sides results in:
     \[
     S + B = 24
     \]

3. **Substitute the first equation into the second**:
   - We have two equations now:
     1. \( S = 2B \)
     2. \( S + B = 24 \)
   - We can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     2B + B = 24
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     3B = 24
     \]

4. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
     \[
     B = 8
     \]

5. **Find Seth's age**:
   - Now that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
     \[
     S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Seth is \( \boxed{16} \) years old.

To verify, we can check:
- If Brooke is 8, then in 2 years, she will be 10.
- Seth, being twice Brooke's age, is 16, and in 2 years, he will be 18.
- The sum of their ages in 2 years will be \( 10 + 18 = 28 \), which matches the condition given in the problem. Thus, our solution is confirmed.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the given information and then solve for Seth's age.

Given information:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Let's represent Brooke's current age as x.

Step 1: Express Seth's current age in terms of Brooke's age.
Seth's current age = 2x

Step 2: Write an equation for the sum of their ages in 2 years.
Sum of their ages in 2 years = (x + 2) + (2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Seth and Brooke based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as Seth's current age.
- \( B \) as Brooke's current age.

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
   \[
   S = 2B
   \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
   \[
   (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
   \]

Let's simplify the second equation:
\[
S + 2 + B + 2 = 28
\]
\[
S +...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Seth is twice as old as Brooke
* In 2 years, their ages will add up to 28

Let's solve:
1. Let's say Brooke's current age is x
* Then Seth's current age is 2x (since he's twice as old)

2. In 2 years:
* Brooke's age will be: x + 2
* Seth's age will be: 2x + 2
* Their sum will be 28

3. Write an equation:
* (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28

4. Solve the equation:
* x + 2 + 2x + 2 = 28
* 3x + 4 = 28
* 3x = 24
* x = 8

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1) Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write this as: S = 2B.

2) In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as: (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

Now, we can substitute the first equation (S = 2B) into the second equation to solve for B.

So, (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28.

This simplifies to 3B + 4 = 28.

Subtract 4 from both sides to get 3B = 24.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for Seth's age.

Given:
- Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
- In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.

Step 1: Let's express Seth's age in terms of Brooke's age.
Seth's age = 2 Ã— Brooke's age

Step 2: Express their ages in 2 years.
In 2 years, Brooke's age = Brooke's current age + 2
In 2 years, Seth's age = Seth's current age + 2
