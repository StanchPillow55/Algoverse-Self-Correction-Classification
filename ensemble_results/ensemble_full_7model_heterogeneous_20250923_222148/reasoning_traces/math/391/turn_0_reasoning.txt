Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have.

Let:
- \( B \) = number of popsicles Betty has
- \( S \) = number of popsicles Sam has

According to the problem, the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is given as \( 5:6 \). This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

From this ratio, we can express \( B \) in terms of \( S \):

\[
B = \frac{5}{6} S
\]

We also know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165:

\[
B + S = 165
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) into the total equation:

\[
\frac{5}{6} S + S = 165
\]

To combine the terms on the left side, we can express \( S \) as \( \frac{6}{6} S \):

\[
\frac{5}{6} S + \frac{6}{6} S = 165
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{11}{6} S = 165
\]

Next, we solve for \( S \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{6}{11} \):

\[
S = 165 \times \frac{6}{11}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
S = 165 \div 11 \times 6
\]
\[
S = 15 \times 6
\]
\[
S = 90
\]

Now that we have the number of popsicles Sam has, we can find the number of popsicles Betty has using the expression we derived earlier:

\[
B = \frac{5}{6} S = \frac{5}{6} \times 90
\]

Calculating \( B \):

\[
B = 75
\]

Now we know:
- Betty has \( 75 \) popsicles.
- Sam has \( 90 \) popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:

\[
S - B = 90 - 75 = 15
\]

Thus, Sam has \( 15 \) more popsicles than Betty.

Finally, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6.
- The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

Step 1: Find the total parts in the ratio.
The ratio is 5:6, so the total parts is 5 + 6 = 11.

Step 2: Find the value of each part in the ratio.
Total popsicles / Total parts = Value of each part
165 / 11 = 15

Step 3: Find the number of popsicles that Betty has.
Betty's part in ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many popsicles Betty and Sam each have, given the ratio of their popsicles and the total number of popsicles. Then, we will find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what the ratio 5:6 means
   * Betty's portion is 5 parts
   * Sam's portion is 6 parts
   * Total parts = 5 + 6 = 11 parts

2) We know the total number of popsicles is 165
   * If 11 parts = 165 popsicles
   * Then 1 part = 165 รท 11 = 15 popsicles

3) Now we can calculate each person's popsicles
   * Betty has 5 parts
   * Betty's popsicles = 5 ร 15 = 75 popsicles
   * Sam has 6 parts
   *...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

The total number of parts in this ratio is 5 + 6 = 11 parts. 

The problem also tells us that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. 

We can find out how many popsicles each part of the ratio represents by dividing the total number of popsicles by the total number of parts. 

So, 165 popsicles รท 11 parts = 15 pop...

   * The total number of popsicles they have together is 165.

2. Find the total number of parts in the ratio:
   * Betty's parts = 5
   * Sam's parts = 6
   * Total parts = 5 + 6 = 11
