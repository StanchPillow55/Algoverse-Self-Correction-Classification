=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, which includes both geraniums and petunias.

1. **Identify the number of geraniums:**
   Andy plants 90 geraniums. 

   \[
   \text{Number of geraniums} = 90
   \]

2. **Determine the number of petunias:**
   The problem states that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. To find the number of petunias, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums.

   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = \text{Number of geraniums} - 40
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of petunias} = 90 - 40 = 50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of flowers:**
   Now that we have the number of geraniums and petunias, we can find the total number of flowers by adding the two quantities together.

   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of geraniums} + \text{Number of petunias}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of flowers} = 90 + 50 = 140
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of flowers that Andy plants is 

   \[
   \boxed{140}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andy plants 90 geraniums.
- Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

Step 1: Calculate the number of petunias Andy plants.
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40 = 50 petunias

Step 2: Calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants.
Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50 = 140 flowers

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flowers Andy plants, which includes both geraniums and petunias.

1. **Identify the number of geraniums:**
   - Andy plants 90 geraniums.

2. **Determine the number of petunias:**
   - The problem states that Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.
   - Since he plants 90 geraniums, the number of petunias is calculated by subtracting 40 from the number of geraniums:
     \[
     \text{Number of petunia...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, I know Andy plants 90 geraniums

2. To find petunias:
* He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums
* So: Petunias = Geraniums - 40
* Petunias = 90 - 40 = 50 petunias

3. To find total flowers:
* Total = Geraniums + Petunias
* Total = 90 + 50 = 140 flowers

Reasoning: Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, I subtracted 40 from the number of geraniums to get the number of petunias. Then I added ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Andy plants 90 geraniums. 

He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums. To find out how many petunias he plants, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums. 

90 geraniums - 40 = 50 petunias

To find the total number of flowers he plants, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together.

90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Andy plants 90 geraniums.
   * He plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums.

2. Calculate the number of petunias Andy plants:
   * Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
   * Number of petunias = 90 - 40
   * Number of petunias = 50

3. Calculate the total number of flowers Andy plants:
   * Total flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
   * Total f...
