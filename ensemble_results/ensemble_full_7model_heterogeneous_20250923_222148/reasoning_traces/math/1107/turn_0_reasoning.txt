Final Answer: To find out how many girls are in the school, we first need to determine the total school population based on the information given about the boys.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that 40% of the school's population is made up of boys, and that there are 240 boys in total.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( P \) be the total school population. According to the problem, 40% of \( P \) is equal to the number of boys:
   \[
   0.40P = 240
   \]

3. **Solving for \( P \)**: To find \( P \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40}
   \]

4. **Calculating \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{240}{0.40} = 240 \div 0.40
   \]
   To divide by a decimal, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 100 to eliminate the decimal:
   \[
   P = \frac{240 \times 100}{0.40 \times 100} = \frac{24000}{40}
   \]
   Now, we can perform the division:
   \[
   P = 600
   \]

5. **Finding the number of girls**: Now that we know the total population \( P \) is 600, we can find the number of girls. Since the boys make up 40% of the population, the remaining percentage (which represents the girls) is:
   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

6. **Calculating the number of girls**: We can find the number of girls by calculating 60% of the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 0.60 \times P = 0.60 \times 600
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 360
   \]

7. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of girls in the school is:
   \[
   \boxed{360}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total school population and then calculate the number of girls in the school.

Given information:
- 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys.

Step 1: Find the total school population.
Let the total school population be x.
40% of x = 240 boys
0.40x = 240
x = 240 / 0.40
x = 600

Therefore, the total school population is 600 students.

Step 2: Find the number of girls in the school.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of students in the school and then find out how many of them are girls.

**Step 1: Determine the percentage of boys in the school.**

We are given that 40% of the school population is made up of boys. This means that the boys represent 40% of the total number of students.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of students in the school.**

We know that 40% of the school population equals 240 boys. We can set up ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* 40% of the school population is boys
* There are 240 boys

Step 1: If 40% equals 240 boys, let me find what 100% equals (total school population)
* 40% = 240
* To find 100%, I need to divide 240 by 40 and multiply by 100
* 240 รท 40 ร 100 = 600
* So the total school population is 600 students

Step 2: Find the percentage of girls
* If boys are 40%, then girls must be 60%
* 100% - 40% = 60% girls

Step 3: Cal...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out what percentage of the school population the boys represent. If 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, then 100% (the total school population) would be represented by a larger number.

We can set up a proportion to solve for this:

40% / 240 boys = 100% / total school population

We can solve for the total school population by cross-multiplying:

40 * total school population = 240 * 100

This simplifies to:

40 * total school popu...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to calculate the total number of students in the school, and then determine the number of girls.

Given:
- 40% of the school population is boys.
- The number of boys is 240.

Step 1: Express the number of boys as a fraction of the total school population.
Boys = 40% of the total population
40% can be written as a fraction: 40/100 or 2/5

Step 2: Set up an equation to solve ...
