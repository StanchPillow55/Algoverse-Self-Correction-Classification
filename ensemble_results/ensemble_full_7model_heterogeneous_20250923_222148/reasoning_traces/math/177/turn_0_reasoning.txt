=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating each expense and donation Zaid makes from his monthly salary of $6000.

1. **Calculate Zaid's expenses on rent and car fuel:**
   - **Rent:** Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
     \[
     \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
     \]

   - **Car Fuel:** Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
     \[
     \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
     \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Rent} + \text{Car Fuel} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Salary} - \text{Total Expenses} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500
   \]

4. **Calculate the donation to charity:**
   - Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity.
   \[
   \text{Donation to Charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = \text{Remaining Amount} - \text{Donation to Charity} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250
   \]

6. **Calculate the expenses for his daughter and wife:**
   - Zaid gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses.
   - Zaid gives his wife $700 for groceries and household goods.
   \[
   \text{Total for Daughter and Wife} = 200 + 700 = 900
   \]

7. **Calculate the final amount Zaid has after all expenses and donations:**
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} - \text{Total for Daughter and Wife} = 1250 - 900 = 350
   \]

Thus, after all his expenses and donations, Zaid will have **$350** left.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Zaid's salary is $6000.

First, let's calculate how much he spends on rent. He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, so:
$6000 * 1/4 = $1500

Next, let's calculate how much he spends on car fuel. He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, so:
$6000 * 1/3 = $2000

So, the total amount he spends on rent and car fuel is:
$1500 (rent) + $2000 (fuel) = $3500

Now, let's subtract this amount from his total salary to find out how much he has left:
$6000 (salary) - $3500 (expenses) = $...
