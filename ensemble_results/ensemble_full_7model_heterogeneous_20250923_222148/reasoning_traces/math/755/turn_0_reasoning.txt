Final Answer: To determine how many matches Joey played in one week, we will break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Matches Played on Monday**: 
   - Joey played 2 matches on Monday.

2. **Matches Played on Friday**: 
   - Joey played 1 match on Friday.

3. **Matches Played on Saturday**: 
   - The problem states that on Saturday, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, we calculate the number of matches he played on Saturday as follows:
   \[
   \text{Matches on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Matches on Monday} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Total Matches Played in the Week**: 
   - Now we will add up all the matches Joey played throughout the week:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = \text{Matches on Monday} + \text{Matches on Friday} + \text{Matches on Saturday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 2 + 1 + 4
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   \[
   \text{Total Matches} = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7
   \]

Thus, Joey played a total of 7 matches in one week.

**Final Answer**: Joey played 7 matches in one week.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 

On Friday, he played 1 match. 

On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, double that would be 2*2 = 4 matches on Saturday. 

To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we add the number of matches he played each day: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches. 

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.
