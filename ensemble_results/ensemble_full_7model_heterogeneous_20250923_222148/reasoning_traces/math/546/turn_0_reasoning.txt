=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many letters Elise has written in total, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Writing the Alphabet Twice:**
   The English alphabet consists of 26 letters. When Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, we can calculate the total letters written as follows:
   \[
   26 \text{ letters} \times 2 = 52 \text{ letters}
   \]

2. **Writing Half of the Alphabet Once:**
   Half of the alphabet means she writes 13 letters (since half of 26 is 13). Thus, the total letters written for this part is:
   \[
   13 \text{ letters}
   \]

3. **Re-writing Everything Already Written:**
   At this point, Elise has written:
   - 52 letters from writing the alphabet twice
   - 13 letters from writing half of the alphabet

   To find out how many letters she has written so far, we add these two amounts:
   \[
   52 + 13 = 65 \text{ letters}
   \]
   Now, when she rewrites everything she has already written, she writes another 65 letters.

4. **Calculating the Total:**
   Finally, we need to add the letters from the re-writing step to the total we have so far:
   \[
   65 \text{ letters (already written)} + 65 \text{ letters (rewritten)} = 130 \text{ letters}
   \]

Thus, the total number of letters Elise has written in total is:
\[
\boxed{130}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of letters Elise has written.

Given information:
- Elise writes the full alphabet twice.
- Elise writes half of the alphabet once.
- Elise re-writes everything she has already written.

Step 1: Calculate the number of letters in the full alphabet.
The full alphabet has 26 letters.

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters Elise writes in the first two full iterations of the alphabet.
Number ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track how many letters Elise writes at each step and then sum them up.

1. **First Step: Writing the Alphabet in Full Twice**
   - The English alphabet consists of 26 letters.
   - Elise writes the entire alphabet twice.
   - Therefore, the number of letters written in this step is:
     \[
     26 \times 2 = 52
     \]

2. **Second Step: Writing Half of the Alphabet Once**
   - Half of the alphabet would be half of 26 letters....

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's count how many letters are in the alphabet
* The alphabet has 26 letters

2. Let's track what Elise writes initially:
* Writes full alphabet first time = 26 letters
* Writes full alphabet second time = 26 letters
* Writes half of alphabet once = 13 letters
* Subtotal after first three writings = 26 + 26 + 13 = 65 letters

3. Then she re-writes everything she has already written
* She rewrites all 65 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many letters are in the alphabet. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.

Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. This means she writes 26 letters * 2 = 52 letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes an additional 13 letters.

So far, she has written 52 + 13 = 65 letters.

Then, she re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes another 65 letters.

So, in total, Elise has wr...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The alphabet has 26 letters.
   * Elise writes the full alphabet twice.
   * Then she writes half of the alphabet once.
   * Finally, she re-writes everything she has already written.

2. Calculate the number of letters Elise writes in the first step:
   * Full alphabet = 26 letters
   * She writes it twice: 26 Ã— 2 = 52 letters

3. Calculate the number of letters Elise...
