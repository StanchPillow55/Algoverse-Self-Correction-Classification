=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these statements into equations.

### Step 1: Translate the first statement

The first statement says:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times that, so we can write the equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]

### Step 2: Translate the second statement

The second statement says:
- In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
- Wendy's current age \( W \) is what we are comparing Colin's future age to. The equation for this statement is:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
\]

### Step 3: Solve the equations

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

#### Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation

Substituting \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation gives:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

#### Simplify the right side

Calculating the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

#### Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 3

\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

#### Rearranging the equation

Now, let's rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]
\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

#### Solve for \( C \)

Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 4: Find Wendy's age

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Conclusion

Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\] 

This satisfies both original conditions, confirming that the solution is correct.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age and \( C \) be Colin's current age.

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's translate these statements into equations.

### Step 1: Translate the first statement

The first statement says:
- Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
- Wendy's current age \( W \) is five times that, so we can ...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the given information and then solve for Colin's current age.

Given information:
- Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
- In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be Colin's current age.
- Let y be Wendy's current age.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the first given information.
Wendy's age = 5 Ã— ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for Colin's current age. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

### Step 2: Translate the Problem into Equations
We have two key pieces of information that we can translate into equations:

1. **Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.**
   - Seven y...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define variables:
* Let c = Colin's current age
* Let w = Wendy's current age

2) From the first statement: "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now"
* Colin will be (c + 7) in seven years
* w = 5(c + 7)
* w = 5c + 35

3) From the second statement: "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now"
* Colin's age in 25 years: c + 25
* This equals one-third of Wendy's current...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the problem, we have two equations:

1. W = 5 * (C + 7) (Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now)

2. C + 25 = W/3 (In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's express W from the first equation:

W = 5C + 35

Then, we substitute W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (5C ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use variables to represent the ages and set up equations based on the given information.

Let's define the variables:
- Let w be Wendy's current age
- Let c be Colin's current age

Step 1: Express Wendy's age in terms of Colin's age 7 years from now.
Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
w = 5(c + 7)

Step 2: Express Colin's age in 25 years in terms of Wendy's current age...
