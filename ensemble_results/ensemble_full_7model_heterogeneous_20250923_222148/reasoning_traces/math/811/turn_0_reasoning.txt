Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week and then find the average number of branches he climbed per day.

1. **Determine the total amount Felix earned per branch climbed:**
   - Felix charges $0.25 for each branch he climbs.

2. **Calculate the total number of branches climbed during the week:**
   - Felix made a total of $105 during the week.
   - To find the total number of branches climbed, we divide the total earnings by the cost per branch:
   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   - To divide $105 by $0.25, we can convert $0.25 to a fraction:
   \[
   0.25 = \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   - Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
   \[
   \frac{105}{0.25} = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]
   - Therefore, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

4. **Calculate the average number of branches climbed per day:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we divide the total number of branches by 7:
   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{420}{7} = 60
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - On average, Felix climbed **60 branches per day**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the average number of branches Felix climbed per day.

Given information:
- Felix charges $0.25 per branch he climbs.
- During the week, he made a total of $105.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week.
Total branches climbed = Total earnings / Cost per branch
Total branches climbed = $105 / $0.25 = 420 branches

Step 2: Calculate the average number of branches climbed per da...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of branches Felix climbed per day over the course of a week. Here’s how we can break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of branches climbed in the week:**

   Felix charges $0.25 per branch. He made a total of $105 during the week. To find out how many branches he climbed, we need to divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch.

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Felix charges $0.25 per branch
* He made $105 in one week
* We need to find the average number of branches per day

2. Let's find the total number of branches he climbed in the week:
* Each branch = $0.25
* Total money = $105
* Total branches = $105 ÷ $0.25
* Total branches = 420 branches in the week

3. To find the average branches per day:
* One week = 7 days
*...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week. Since he charges $.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made by the cost per branch.

So, $105 ÷ $.25 = 420 branches

This means Felix climbed 420 branches in total during the week.

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find this by dividing the total number of...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Felix charges $0.25 per branch he climbs.
   * He made a total of $105 during the week.

2. Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week:
   * Total money earned = $105
   * Charge per branch = $0.25
   * Total branches climbed = Total money earned ÷ Charge per branch
   * Total branches climbed = $105 ÷ $0.25
   * Total branches climbed = 420 b...
