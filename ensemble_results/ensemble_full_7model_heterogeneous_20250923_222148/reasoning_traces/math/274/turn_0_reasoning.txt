=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan spent on the seeds, we need to calculate the total cost for both the tomato seeds and the celery seeds separately, and then add those amounts together.

1. **Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
   - The cost of one packet of tomato seeds is $40.
   - To find the total cost for the tomato seeds, we multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 20 \times 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for tomato seeds} = 800
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the celery seeds:**
   - Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
   - The cost of one packet of celery seeds is $30.
   - To find the total cost for the celery seeds, we again multiply the number of packets by the cost per packet:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for celery seeds} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Cost per packet}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 80 \times 30
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for celery seeds} = 2400
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for all seeds:**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the tomato seeds and the total cost of the celery seeds together:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for tomato seeds} + \text{Total cost for celery seeds}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 3200
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds is **$3200**.

Final answer: **$3200**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds
* Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds
* Each tomato seed packet costs $40
* Each celery seed packet costs $30

2. Let's calculate the cost of tomato seeds:
* Cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
* Cost of tomato seeds = 20 × $40
* Cost of tomato seeds = $800

3. Let's calculate the cost of celery seed...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find out how much money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to multiply the number of each type of seed packet she bought by the cost of each packet, and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the tomato seeds. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, the total cost for the tomato seeds is:

20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate the cost for the celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of cele...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds and 80 packets of celery seeds.
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of tomato seeds.
Total cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
Total cost of tomato seeds = 20 × $40 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of celery seeds.
