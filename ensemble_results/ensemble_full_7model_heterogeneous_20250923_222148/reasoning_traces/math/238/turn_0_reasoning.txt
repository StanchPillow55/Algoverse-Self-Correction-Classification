=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa based on the relationships provided.

1. **Identify Jessa's age**: 
   We are given that Jessa is 20 years old.
   \[
   \text{Jessa's age} = 20 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine Joan's age**: 
   The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa. Therefore, we can calculate Joan's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine Mary's age**: 
   The problem also states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. We can calculate Mary's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mary's age} = \text{Joan's age} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of their ages**: 
   Now that we have the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Sum of ages} = 23 + 25 + 20
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   23 + 25 = 48
   \]
   \[
   48 + 20 = 68
   \]

Thus, the sum of the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary is two years younger than Joan.
- Joan is five years older than Jessa.
- Jessa is 20 years old.

Step 1: Find Joan's age.
Joan is five years older than Jessa.
Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5 = 25 years old

Step 2: Find Mary's age.
Mary is two years younger than Joan.
Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2 = 23 years old

Step 3: Calculate the sum of the age...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Mary, Joan, and Jessa, and then find the sum of their ages.

1. **Identify Jessa's Age:**
   - We are given that Jessa is 20 years old.

2. **Determine Joan's Age:**
   - The problem states that Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Since Jessa is 20 years old, we calculate Joan's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Joan's age} = \text{Jessa's age} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Determine Mary's Age:**

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Jessa is 20 years old
* Joan is 5 years older than Jessa
* Mary is 2 years younger than Joan

2. Let's find Joan's age:
* Joan = Jessa's age + 5
* Joan = 20 + 5
* Joan = 25 years old

3. Let's find Mary's age:
* Mary = Joan's age - 2
* Mary = 25 - 2
* Mary = 23 years old

4. Now we can find the sum of all three ages:
* Total = Jessa + Joan + Mary
* Total = 20 + 25 + 23
* Tota...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the ages of Joan and Mary. 

According to the problem, Joan is five years older than Jessa. Since Jessa is 20 years old, we add 5 to 20 to find Joan's age.

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25 years old

Next, we find Mary's age. The problem states that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, we subtract 2 from Joan's age to find Mary's age.

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23 years old
