=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify how much Eva has saved:**
   - According to the problem, Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Determine how much Anthony has saved:**
   - We know that Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
     \[
     \text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]
   - So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

3. **Calculate how much Roy has saved:**
   - The problem states that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony.
   - First, we need to find 40% of Anthony's savings:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 0.40 \times 30 = 12
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to Anthony's savings to find Roy's savings:
     \[
     \text{Roy's savings} = \text{Anthony's savings} + 40\% \text{ of Anthony's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Roy has saved **$42.00**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Roy has saved 40% more in money earned by chores than his brother Anthony.
- Anthony has saved $10.00 more than their sister Eva.
- Eva has saved $20.00.

Step 1: Find how much money Anthony has saved.
Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can calculate Anthony's savings as:
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
Anthony's savings = $20.00 + $10.00...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each sibling has saved, starting with Eva and working our way up to Roy.

1. **Determine Eva's Savings:**
   - We are given that Eva has saved $20.00.

2. **Determine Anthony's Savings:**
   - Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva.
   - Since Eva has $20.00, we calculate Anthony's savings as follows:
     \[
     \text{Anthony's Savings} = \text{Eva's Savings} + 10.00 = 20.00 + 10.00 = 30.00
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Eva has saved $20.00
* Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva
* Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony

2. Let's find Anthony's savings:
* Anthony = Eva + $10.00
* Anthony = $20.00 + $10.00
* Anthony = $30.00

3. Now let's find Roy's savings:
* Roy has 40% more than Anthony
* To find 40% more, multiply by 1.40
* Roy = Anthony × 1.40
* Roy = $30.00 × 1.40
* Roy = $42.00

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Anthony has saved. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can add these two amounts together to find Anthony's total savings. 

$10.00 + $20.00 = $30.00

So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Next, we need to find out how much money Roy has saved. Since Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony, we need to calculate 40% of Anthony's savings and then add that amount to Anthony's total savings.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way to find out how much money Roy has saved.

Given:
- Eva has saved $20.00
- Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva
- Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony

Step 1: Calculate how much money Anthony has saved.
Anthony's savings = Eva's savings + $10.00
