=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Sally spends in total on the pizzas, we need to calculate the cost of each pizza and then sum those costs.

1. **Cost of the small pizza**: 
   - The problem states that the small pizza costs $8.

2. **Cost of the family-size pizza**: 
   - The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. 
   - Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

3. **Total cost**: 
   - Now, we add the cost of the small pizza and the cost of the family-size pizza to find the total amount spent:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24 = 32
     \]

Thus, the total amount that Sally spends on both pizzas is **$32**.

Final answer: **$32**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sally buys one small pizza that costs $8.
- Sally buys one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × $8 = $24

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Sally spends.
Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Sally spends on both pizzas. We are given the cost of the small pizza and the relationship between the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of the small pizza:**
   - The small pizza costs $8.

2. **Determine the cost of the family-size pizza:**
   - We are told that the family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.
...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Small pizza costs $8
* Family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza

2. Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza:
* Family-size pizza = 3 × Small pizza cost
* Family-size pizza = 3 × $8
* Family-size pizza = $24

3. Calculate total spent by adding both pizzas:
* Total = Small pizza + Family-size pizza
* Total = $8 + $24
* Total = $32

Therefore, Sally spends ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the family-size pizza costs. Since it's 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

$8 * 3 = $24

So, the family-size pizza costs $24.

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find out how much Sally spends in total.

$8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in total.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Sally buys one small pizza at $8.
- She also buys one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.

Step 1: Determine the cost of the family-size pizza.
The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × $8 = $24

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Sally spends on the piz...
