=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up some equations based on the information given.

1. **Initial Fish Count**: 
   - Bob initially has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish Bob starts with is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial fish} = 3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

2. **Fish Bought from the Store**:
   - Bob buys a total of 17 fish from the pet store. Let \( x \) be the number of orange fish he bought, and \( y \) be the number of white fish he bought.
   - We know that:
     \[
     x + y = 17
     \]

3. **Final Fish Count**:
   - After adding the fish from the store, the total number of orange fish in the pond becomes \( 3 + x \) and the total number of white fish becomes \( 4 + y \).

4. **Condition Given in the Problem**:
   - After adding the new fish, Bob finds that he has twice as many orange fish as white fish. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     3 + x = 2(4 + y)
     \]

5. **Expanding the Equation**:
   - Let's expand the equation \( 3 + x = 2(4 + y) \):
     \[
     3 + x = 8 + 2y
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     x - 2y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]

6. **Substituting the First Equation**:
   - We have two equations now:
     1. \( x + y = 17 \) (Equation 2)
     2. \( x - 2y = 5 \) (Equation 1)

   - We can solve these equations simultaneously. From Equation 2, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
     \[
     x = 17 - y
     \]

7. **Substituting into Equation 1**:
   - Substitute \( x \) into Equation 1:
     \[
     (17 - y) - 2y = 5
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     17 - 3y = 5
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives:
     \[
     -3y = 5 - 17
     \]
     \[
     -3y = -12
     \]
     \[
     y = 4
     \]

8. **Finding \( x \)**:
   - Now substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 2 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x + 4 = 17
     \]
     \[
     x = 17 - 4 = 13
     \]

9. **Final Counts**:
   - Bob bought 13 orange fish and 4 white fish.

10. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of white fish Bob bought at the store is:
     \[
     \boxed{4}
     \]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to set up some equations based on the information given.

1. **Initial Fish Count**: 
   - Bob initially has 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.
   - Therefore, the total number of fish Bob starts with is:
     \[
     \text{Total initial fish} = 3 \text{ (orange)} + 4 \text{ (white)} = 7 \text{ fish}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob initially had 7 fish in his pond
  - 3 were orange
  - 4 were white
- Bob bought 17 more fish from the pet store
- After adding the new fish, he had twice as many orange fish as white fish

Step 1: Find the total number of fish Bob had after adding the 17 new fish.
Initial number of fish = 7
New fish added = 17
Total number of fish = 7 + 17 = 24

Step 2: Set up an equation to represen...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many white fish Bob bought at the store. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Setup

1. **Initial Fish Count:**
   - Bob initially had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish in his pond.

2. **Fish Bought:**
   - Bob bought 17 fish from the pet store. These fish are a mix of orange and white fish.

3. **Final Condition:**
   - After adding the 17 fish to his pond, Bob has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know initially:
* Bob started with 7 fish:
  * 3 orange fish
  * 4 white fish
* He bought 17 more fish (mix of orange and white)
* After adding new fish, orange fish = 2 × white fish

2. Let's say he bought:
* x white fish
* (17-x) orange fish (since total new fish = 17)

3. After adding new fish:
* Total white fish = 4 + x
* Total orange fish = 3 + (17-x)

4. Since orange fish = 2 × white ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store as O and the number of white fish as W. 

From the problem, we know that Bob bought 17 fish in total, so we can write the first equation as:

O + W = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Before buying new fish, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. So, we can write the second equation as:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Let's simplify the second equat...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, Bob had 7 fish in his pond: 3 orange and 4 white.
   * He bought 17 more fish from the pet store.
   * After adding the new fish, he has twice as many orange fish as white fish.

2. Let's define variables to represent the unknown quantities:
   * Let 'w' be the number of white fish Bob bought from the store.
   * Since he bought a total of 17 fish, the...
