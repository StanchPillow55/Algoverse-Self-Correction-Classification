=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon, and then determine the cashback amount that will be received from the app company.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas before cashback.**

The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, we can calculate the total cost using the formula:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Price per Gallon} \times \text{Number of Gallons}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cashback amount.**

The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon. To find the total cashback for 10 gallons, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Total Cashback} = \text{Cashback per Gallon} \times \text{Number of Gallons}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Cashback} = 0.20 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the final cost after applying the cashback.**

To find the final cost after cashback, we subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[
\text{Final Cost} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Total Cashback}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Final Cost} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars} - 2.00 \, \text{dollars} = 28.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The final cost of the gas after applying the cashback rewards is **$28.00**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 per gallon.
- The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon.
- The person is buying 10 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the gas before the cashback.
Total cost of gas = Number of gallons × Price per gallon
Total cost of gas = 10 gallons × $3.00 per gallon = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback amount.
Cashback per gal...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the gas before cashback, determine the cashback amount, and then subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the final cost after cashback.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost Before Cashback

The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, we can calculate the total cost before cashback by multiplying the price per gallon by the number of gallons purchased:

\[

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the initial cost of gas:
* Cost per gallon = $3.00
* Number of gallons = 10
* Initial cost = $3.00 × 10 = $30.00

2. Next, let's calculate the total cashback:
* Cashback per gallon = $0.20
* Number of gallons = 10
* Total cashback = $0.20 × 10 = $2.00

3. Finally, let's subtract the cashback from the initial cost:
* Final cost = Initial cost - Total cashback
* Final cost = $30.00 - $2.00 = ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas without any cashback. The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon and someone is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cost would be:

$3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00

Next, let's calculate the total cashback. The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon and someone is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cashback would be:

$0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00

Finally, to find out how much the gas will cost after th...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

Given information:
- Gas price: $3.00 per gallon
- Cashback offer: $0.20 per gallon
- Amount of gas purchased: 10 gallons

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas before cashback.
Total cost before cashback = Gas price × Amount of gas purchased
Total cost before cashback = $3.00 × 10 gallons
Total cost before cashback = $30.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cashback amount.
Total cashback = Cashback offe...
