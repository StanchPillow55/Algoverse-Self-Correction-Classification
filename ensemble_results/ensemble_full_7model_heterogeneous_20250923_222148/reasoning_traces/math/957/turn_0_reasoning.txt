=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Aliya's age**: 
   We are given that Aliya is currently 3 years old.

2. **Determine Shawna's age**: 
   The problem states that Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. 
   Since Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Shawna's father's age**: 
   Next, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
   We can calculate Shawna's father's age using Shawna's age:
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how old Shawna is. 

Since Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old, we can calculate Shawna's age by multiplying Aliya's age by 3. 

Shawna's age = 3 * Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 * 3
Shawna's age = 9 years old

Now, let's find out how old Shawna's father is. 

Since Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, we can calculate his age by multiplying Shawna's age by 5. 

Shawna's father's age = 5 * Shawna's age
Shawna's fa...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find Shawna's age first, and then we'll calculate her father's age.

Given:
- Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.
- Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya.
- Aliya is 3 years old.

Step 1: Determine Shawna's age.
Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, and Aliya is 3 years old.
Shawna's age = 3 × Aliya's age
Shawna's age = 3 × 3 = 9 years old

Step 2: Ca...
