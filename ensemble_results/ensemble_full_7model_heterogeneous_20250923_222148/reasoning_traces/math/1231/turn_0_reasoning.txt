Final Answer: To find Sally's mean score from her math quizzes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **List the Scores**: First, we will list all the scores Sally received:
   - 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60

2. **Count the Number of Scores**: Next, we will count how many scores there are. In this case, there are 9 scores.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Scores**: We will add all the scores together to find the total sum.
   \[
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - \(50 + 80 = 130\)
   - \(130 + 80 = 210\)
   - \(210 + 60 = 270\)
   - \(270 + 40 = 310\)
   - \(310 + 90 = 400\)
   - \(400 + 100 = 500\)
   - \(500 + 70 = 570\)
   - \(570 + 60 = 630\)

   So, the total sum of the scores is \(630\).

4. **Calculate the Mean**: The mean (average) score is calculated by dividing the total sum of the scores by the number of scores.
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Total Sum of Scores}}{\text{Number of Scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   630 \div 9 = 70
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, Sally's mean score is \(70\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) To find the mean score, I need to:
   * Add up all the scores (find the sum)
   * Divide by the number of scores (count)

2) Let me count the number of scores:
   50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, 60
   There are 9 scores total

3) Now let me add up all the scores:
   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

4) Calculate the mean by dividing the sum by the count:
   630 รท 9 = 70

Therefore, Sally's mean ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The mean score is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of scores. 

First, let's add up all of Sally's quiz scores:

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Next, we need to count how many scores there are. Sally has 9 quiz scores.

Finally, we divide the total score by the number of scores to find the mean:

630 รท 9 = 70

So, the mean score of Sally's math quizzes is 70.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step to find Sally's mean quiz score.

Given:
- Sally's quiz scores are: 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60.

Step 1: Understand what the mean is.
The mean is the average of a set of numbers, calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count of numbers in the set.

Step 2: Count the number of quiz scores.
Sally has 9 quiz scores in total.

Step 3: Add up all of Sally's quiz scores.
