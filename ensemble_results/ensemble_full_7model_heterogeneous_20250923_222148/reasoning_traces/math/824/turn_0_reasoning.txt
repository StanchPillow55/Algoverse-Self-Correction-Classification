Final Answer: To determine how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we will first calculate the total number of tins of cat food and dog food separately, and then find the difference between the two totals.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of tins of cat food.**

Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contains 11 tins. We can calculate the total number of tins of cat food using the formula:

\[
\text{Total tins of cat food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total tins of cat food} = 8 \times 11
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
8 \times 11 = 88
\]

So, Kimberly bought **88 tins of cat food**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of tins of dog food.**

Next, we calculate the total number of tins of dog food. Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contains 6 tins. We can use the same formula:

\[
\text{Total tins of dog food} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Tins per package}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total tins of dog food} = 6 \times 6
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

So, Kimberly bought **36 tins of dog food**.

**Step 3: Find the difference between the total tins of cat food and dog food.**

Now we need to find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought. We do this by subtracting the total tins of dog food from the total tins of cat food:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total tins of cat food} - \text{Total tins of dog food}
\]

Substituting in the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 88 - 36
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
88 - 36 = 52
\]

Thus, Kimberly bought **52 more tins of cat food than dog food**.

**Final Answer:**
Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of cat food tins:
* 8 packages × 11 tins per package
* 8 × 11 = 88 tins of cat food

2. Next, let's find the total number of dog food tins:
* 6 packages × 6 tins per package
* 6 × 6 = 36 tins of dog food

3. To find how many more tins of cat food than dog food:
* Subtract dog food tins from cat food tins
* 88 - 36 = 52 tins

Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food th...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many tins of cat food Kimberly bought. To do this, we multiply the number of packages of cat food she bought by the number of tins in each package. 

So, 8 packages of cat food * 11 tins per package = 88 tins of cat food.

Next, we need to find out how many tins of dog food Kimberly bought. We do this in the same way, by multiplying the number of packages of dog food she bought by the number of tins in each package.

So, 6 packages of dog fo...
