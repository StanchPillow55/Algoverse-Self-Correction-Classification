=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total amount of money Sharon received from the tooth fairy for each of her lost teeth.

1. **First Tooth**: 
   - The tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00 for her first tooth.
   - Amount received: **$5.00**

2. **Next Three Teeth**: 
   - For each of the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00.
   - Amount received for these three teeth:
     - Second tooth: $1.00
     - Third tooth: $1.00
     - Fourth tooth: $1.00
   - Total for these three teeth: 
     \[
     1.00 + 1.00 + 1.00 = 3.00
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth**: 
   - For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50
     \]
   - Amount received for the last two teeth:
     - Fifth tooth: $0.50
     - Sixth tooth: $0.50
   - Total for these two teeth:
     \[
     0.50 + 0.50 = 1.00
     \]

4. **Total Amount Received**: 
   - Now we will sum all the amounts Sharon received:
     - From the first tooth: $5.00
     - From the next three teeth: $3.00
     - From the last two teeth: $1.00
   - Total amount:
     \[
     5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is **$9.00**.

Final answer: **$9.00**

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First tooth:
* Sharon got $5.00 for the first tooth

2. Next three teeth:
* Sharon got $1.00 per tooth
* $1.00 × 3 teeth = $3.00 total for these three teeth

3. Last two teeth:
* The amount per tooth is half of what she got for the previous three teeth
* Previous amount was $1.00 per tooth
* So half of $1.00 = $0.50 per tooth
* $0.50 × 2 teeth = $1.00 total for these two teeth

4. Total amount calculation:
* Firs...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we know that Sharon received $5.00 for her first tooth.

Next, she lost three more teeth and received $1.00 for each of these teeth. So, she received 3 * $1.00 = $3.00 for these three teeth.

Then, for each of the last two teeth Sharon lost, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since she had received $1.00 per tooth for the previous three teeth, this means she received $1.00 / 2 = $0.5...
