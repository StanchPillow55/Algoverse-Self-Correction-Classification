=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of chimichangas made by the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

1. **Chimichangas made on Tuesday**: 
   The problem states that the shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays. 
   \[
   \text{Chimichangas on Tuesday} = 125
   \]

2. **Chimichangas made on Wednesday**: 
   Similarly, the shop also makes 125 chimichangas on Wednesdays. 
   \[
   \text{Chimichangas on Wednesday} = 125
   \]

3. **Chimichangas made on Friday**: 
   The problem indicates that the shop makes twice as many chimichangas on Friday as it does on the other two days. Since they make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday and Wednesday, we can calculate the number made on Friday as follows:
   \[
   \text{Chimichangas on Friday} = 2 \times 125 = 250
   \]

4. **Total chimichangas made over the three days**: 
   Now, we need to find the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. We do this by adding the number of chimichangas made on each of these days:
   \[
   \text{Total chimichangas} = \text{Chimichangas on Tuesday} + \text{Chimichangas on Wednesday} + \text{Chimichangas on Friday}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total chimichangas} = 125 + 125 + 250
   \]

5. **Performing the addition**:
   First, we add the chimichangas made on Tuesday and Wednesday:
   \[
   125 + 125 = 250
   \]
   Now, we add this result to the number made on Friday:
   \[
   250 + 250 = 500
   \]

Thus, the total number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is:
\[
\boxed{500}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* They make 125 chimichangas on Tuesday
* They make 125 chimichangas on Wednesday
* They make twice as many on Friday as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday

2. Let's calculate how many they make on Friday:
* Friday's amount = 2 × 125
* Friday's amount = 250 chimichangas

3. Now let's add all three days together:
* Total = Tuesday + Wednesday + Friday
* Total = 125 + 125 + 250
* To...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on both Tuesday and Wednesday. So, for these two days, the total number of chimichangas made is:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) = 250 chimichangas

On Friday, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesday (or Wednesday, since the amount is the same). So, on Friday, they make:

2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas

Adding the chimichangas made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday gives us the total for the three days:...
