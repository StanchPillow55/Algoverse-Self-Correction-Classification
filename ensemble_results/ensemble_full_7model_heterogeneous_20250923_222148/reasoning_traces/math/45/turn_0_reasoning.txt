=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the number of articles Meredith wrote each day, and then calculate the total time she spent writing those articles.

1. **Determine the number of articles written on each day:**
   - **Monday:** Meredith wrote 5 articles.
   - **Tuesday:** She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday. To find the number of articles written on Tuesday, we first calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5 articles:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5
     \]
     \[
     = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
     \]
   - **Wednesday:** She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of articles written on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:**
   - Total articles = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
   \[
   \text{Total articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent writing articles:**
   - Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time spent is:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Total articles} \times \text{Time per article}
   \]
   \[
   = 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Meredith spent a total of **104 hours** writing articles over the three days.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Each article takes 4 hours
* Monday: 5 articles
* Tuesday: 2/5 more than Monday
* Wednesday: 2 times Tuesday's articles

2. Let's calculate Tuesday's articles:
* Monday = 5 articles
* 2/5 more means multiply by (1 + 2/5) = 7/5
* Tuesday = 5 × 7/5 = 7 articles

3. Let's calculate Wednesday's articles:
* Tuesday = 7 articles
* Wednesday = 2 × 7 = 14 articles

4. Now let's calcu...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write, she spent 5 articles * 4 hours/article = <<5*4=20>>20 hours writing on Monday.

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 articles = <<2/5*5=2>>2 more articles than she did on Monday. So, on Tuesday, she wrote 5 articles + 2 articles = <<5+2=7>>7 articles. Therefore, she spent 7 articles * 4 h...
