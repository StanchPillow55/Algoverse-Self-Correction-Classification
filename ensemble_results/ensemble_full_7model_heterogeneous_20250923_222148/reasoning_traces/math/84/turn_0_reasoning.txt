Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many games the football team won, given that they played a total of 22 games and won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( W \) be the number of games won.
- Let \( L \) be the number of games lost.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The total number of games played is 22:
   \[
   W + L = 22
   \]
2. The team won 8 more games than they lost:
   \[
   W = L + 8
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W + L = 22 \)
2. \( W = L + 8 \)

Next, we can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the second equation into the first equation. 

Substituting \( W \) in the first equation:
\[
(L + 8) + L = 22
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
2L + 8 = 22
\]

Next, we will isolate \( L \) by first subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[
2L = 22 - 8
\]
\[
2L = 14
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

Now that we have the number of games lost \( L \), we can find the number of games won \( W \) using the second equation:
\[
W = L + 8
\]
\[
W = 7 + 8 = 15
\]

Thus, the football team won \( W = 15 \) games.

Finally, we can summarize the results:
- The number of games won is \( 15 \).
- The number of games lost is \( 7 \).
- The total number of games played is \( 15 + 7 = 22 \), which is consistent with the information given in the problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of games the football team won.

Given information:
- The football team played a total of 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's represent the number of games they lost as x.

Step 1: Express the number of games they won in terms of the number of games they lost.
Number of games won = Number of games lost + 8
Number of games won = x + 8

Step 2: Find the total number of games played.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many games the football team won out of the 22 games they played, given that they won 8 more games than they lost.

Let's define some variables to help us set up the equations:

- Let \( W \) represent the number of games the team won.
- Let \( L \) represent the number of games the team lost.

We are given two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the games won and los...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Total games played = 22
* Won 8 more games than they lost
* Need to find number of wins

Step 1: Let's define variables
* Let w = number of wins
* Let l = number of losses
* We know w = l + 8 (wins are 8 more than losses)

Step 2: Set up equation using total games
* Total games = wins + losses
* 22 = w + l

Step 3: Substitute w = l + 8 into total games equation
* 22 = (l + 8) + l
* 22 = 2l + 8

Step 4: Solv...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of games the team lost as x. 

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so they won x + 8 games.

The total number of games played by the team is the sum of the games they won and lost, which is 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x (games lost) + x + 8 (games won) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 22 - 8
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 14...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the number of games won.

Given:
- The team played a total of 22 games.
- They won 8 more games than they lost.

Step 1: Let's define variables for the number of games won and lost.
Let x = the number of games won
Let y = the number of games lost

Step 2: Use the given information to set up equations.
