=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find out how many kids are allergic to at least one of the allergens (dairy or peanuts) and then subtract that from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Number of kids allergic to dairy (D) = 9
   - Number of kids allergic to peanuts (P) = 6
   - Number of kids allergic to both dairy and peanuts (B) = 3
   - Total number of kids in the class (T) = 32

2. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:**
   The formula to find the number of kids allergic to at least one of the allergens is:
   \[
   \text{Allergic to at least one} = D + P - B
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Allergic to at least one} = 9 + 6 - 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen:**
   \[
   \text{Allergic to at least one} = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
   \]

4. **Find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything:**
   To find the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids allergic to at least one allergen from the total number of kids:
   \[
   \text{Not allergic to anything} = T - \text{Allergic to at least one}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Not allergic to anything} = 32 - 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the final answer:**
   \[
   \text{Not allergic to anything} = 20
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **20 kids aren't allergic to anything**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of kids in Gina's class who are not allergic to anything.

Given information:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy.
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts.
- There are 32 kids in the class.

Step 1: Find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy or peanuts.
Kids allergic to dairy = 9
Kids allergic to peanuts = 6
Kids allergic to both dairy and peanut...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kids in Gina's class are not allergic to anything. We have information about kids who are allergic to dairy, peanuts, or both. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of kids who are allergic to at least one of these allergens.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the set of kids allergic to dairy.
- \( B \) as the set of kids allergic to peanuts.

From the problem, we know:
- \(|A| = 9\) (the number ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step using set theory.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* Total kids in class = 32
* Allergic to dairy = 9
* Allergic to peanuts = 6
* Allergic to both = 3
* We need to find kids with no allergies

2) To find kids with no allergies, we need to:
* First find total number of kids with ANY allergies
* Then subtract that from total kids

3) To find kids with ANY allergies:
* Kids allergic to dairy only = 9 - 3 = 6 kids
* Kids ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts. However, we can't simply add these two numbers together to get the total number of kids with allergies, because 3 kids are allergic to both. These 3 kids are being counted twice, once in the dairy group and once in the peanut group. 

So, to find the total number of kids with allergies, we add the number of ki...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find the total number of kids who are allergic to either dairy, peanuts, or both. Then, we'll subtract that number from the total number of kids in the class to find out how many aren't allergic to anything.

Given:
- 9 kids are allergic to dairy
- 6 kids are allergic to peanuts
- 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts
- There are 32 kids in Gina's class
