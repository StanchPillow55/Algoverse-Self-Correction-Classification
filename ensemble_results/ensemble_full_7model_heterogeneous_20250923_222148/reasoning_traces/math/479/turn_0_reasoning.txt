=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To calculate the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the plane tickets and the hotel stay.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane tickets
Tom is buying two plane tickets, and each ticket costs $5000.

\[
\text{Cost of plane tickets} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the hotel cost
The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. However, since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.

First, we need to calculate the increased price of the hotel per day:

\[
\text{Increase} = 20\% \text{ of } 1500 = 0.20 \times 1500 = 300
\]

Now, we add this increase to the normal price to find the new price per day:

\[
\text{New hotel price per day} = 1500 + 300 = 1800
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total hotel cost for 3 days
Now, we can calculate the total cost for the hotel for 3 days:

\[
\text{Total hotel cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total trip cost
Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets to the total hotel cost to find the total trip cost:

\[
\text{Total trip cost} = \text{Cost of plane tickets} + \text{Total hotel cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total trip cost} = 10000 + 5400 = 15400
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of the trip is **$15,400**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of plane tickets
* Each ticket costs $5000
* Need 2 tickets (Tom and his wife)
* Total ticket cost = $5000 × 2 = $10,000

2. Next, let's calculate the hotel cost
* Normal price is $1500 per day
* Price is 20% higher than normal
* To find 20% increase: $1500 × 0.20 = $300 increase per day
* New daily rate = $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day
* They stay for 3 days
* Total hotel cost = $18...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Since each ticket costs $5000 and there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. Since the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal, we need to find out what 20% of the normal price is. 20% of $1500 is $1500 * 0.20 = $300. 

So, the cost of the hotel per day during this busy weekend is the normal price plus the additional...
