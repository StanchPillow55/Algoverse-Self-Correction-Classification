Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure. Let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
   - On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

   So, the calculation for the third day is:
   \[
   \text{Holes dug on the third day} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ holes}
   \]

   Now, we can find the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
   \[
   \text{Total holes by end of third day} = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   According to the problem, the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day.

   First, we need to find the number of holes at the end of the first day:
   \[
   \text{Holes at the end of the first day} = 10 \text{ holes}
   \]

   Now, we calculate four times that amount:
   \[
   \text{Holes at the end of the fourth day} = 4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   We know the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day is 40 holes, and we already calculated that there were 29 holes at the end of the third day. Therefore, the number of holes dug on the fourth day can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = \text{Total holes at end of fourth day} - \text{Total holes at end of third day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

Thus, the pirates dug **11 holes** on the fourth day before finding the treasure.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before they found the treasure. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of holes dug by the end of each day:**

   - **First Day:** The pirates dug 10 holes.
     \[
     \text{Holes after Day 1} = 10
     \]

   - **Second Day:** The pirates dug 13 more holes.
     \[
     \text{Holes after Day 2} = 10 + 13 = 23
     \]

   - **Third Day:** The pira...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's track the number of holes by day:
* Day 1: 10 holes dug
* Day 2: 13 more holes dug
* Day 3: 8 holes dug, but 2 holes filled in
* Day 4: Need to find this number

2. Let's calculate total holes after each day:
* End of Day 1: 10 holes
* End of Day 2: 10 + 13 = 23 holes
* End of Day 3: 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes
* End of Day 4: We know this is 4 times the holes at end of Day 1

3. Calculate target number of...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.

On the second day, they dug an additional 13 holes, bringing the total to 10 + 13 = 23 holes.

On the third day, they dug 8 more holes, but then filled in 2. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day was 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes.

The problem states that by the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. At the end of the fir...
