Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the price of the diamond jewel**:
   We are given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

   \[
   \text{Price of diamond jewel} = 2000
   \]

2. **Calculate the price of the gold jewel**:
   The problem states that the price of a gold jewel is \( \frac{4}{5} \) times the price of a diamond jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{8000}{5} = 1600
   \]

3. **Calculate the price of the silver jewel**:
   The problem states that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of the gold jewel. Therefore, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = \text{Price of gold jewel} - 400
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of silver jewel} = 1600 - 400 = 1200
   \]

4. **Calculate the total price for all three jewels**:
   Now that we have the prices for all three jewels, we can find the total price by adding them together:

   \[
   \text{Total price} = \text{Price of diamond jewel} + \text{Price of gold jewel} + \text{Price of silver jewel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price} = 4800
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total price for all three jewels is:

   \[
   \boxed{4800}
   \]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the price of each type of jewel and then find their total cost.

1. **Determine the price of the gold jewel:**

   We are given that the price of a gold jewel is \(\frac{4}{5}\) times the price of a diamond jewel. We also know the price of a diamond jewel is $2000.

   \[
   \text{Price of gold jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond jewel}
   \]

   Substituting the price of the diamond jewel:

   \[
   \text{Price ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Gold Jewell price is 4/5 of Diamond Jewell price
- Silver Jewell price is $400 less than Gold Jewell price
- Diamond Jewell price is $2000

Step 1: Calculate Gold Jewell price
* Gold = 4/5 × Diamond
* Gold = 4/5 × $2000
* Gold = $1600

Step 2: Calculate Silver Jewell price
* Silver = Gold - $400
* Silver = $1600 - $400
* Silver = $1200

Step 3: Calculate total price for all three jewels
* Total ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, let's find the price of the silver jewel. We know that the price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gol...
