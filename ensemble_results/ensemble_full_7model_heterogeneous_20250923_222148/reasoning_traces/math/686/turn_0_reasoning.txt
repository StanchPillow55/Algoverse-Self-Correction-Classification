=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes.**
   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.
   - Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta.
   - Therefore, the number of cookies Celinda bakes is:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda.**
   - Total cookies = Cookies baked by Greta + Cookies baked by Celinda
   - Total cookies = 30 + 60
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies is:
     \[
     30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies}
     \]

3. **Determine how many cookies they eat.**
   - Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.

4. **Calculate the number of cookies that are put in the box.**
   - To find the number of cookies in the box, we subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookies baked.
   - Cookies in the box = Total cookies - Cookies eaten
   - Cookies in the box = 90 - 10
   - Therefore, the number of cookies in the box is:
     \[
     90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of cookies in the box is:
     \[
     \boxed{80}
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many cookies Greta baked:
* Greta baked 30 cookies

2. Next, let's calculate how many cookies Celinda baked:
* Celinda baked twice as many as Greta
* Celinda's cookies = 30 × 2 = 60 cookies

3. Now let's find the total cookies baked:
* Total cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
* Total cookies = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies

4. They ate 10 cookies while cooling:
* Remaining cookies = To...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many cookies Celinda baked. Since she baked twice as many as Greta, who baked 30 cookies, we multiply 30 by 2. 

30 * 2 = 60 cookies

So, Celinda baked 60 cookies. 

Next, we add the number of cookies Greta baked to the number of cookies Celinda baked to find the total number of cookies they baked together.

30 (Greta's cookies) + 60 (Celinda's cookies) = 90 cookies

Then, we subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookie...
