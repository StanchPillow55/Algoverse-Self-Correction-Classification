=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to determine the total number of stripes and the total number of zebras.

1. **Count the stripes on each zebra:**
   - Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each:
     \[
     2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - Then, there is one zebra with 36 stripes:
     \[
     36 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - Finally, there is another zebra with half the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes:
     \[
     \text{Half of } 36 = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ stripes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**
   Now, we add up all the stripes:
   \[
   \text{Total stripes} = 34 + 36 + 18
   \]
   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   34 + 36 = 70
   \]
   \[
   70 + 18 = 88
   \]
   So, the total number of stripes is:
   \[
   88 \text{ stripes}
   \]

3. **Count the total number of zebras:**
   Jane has counted:
   - 2 zebras with 17 stripes each
   - 1 zebra with 36 stripes
   - 1 zebra with 18 stripes

   Therefore, the total number of zebras is:
   \[
   2 + 1 + 1 = 4 \text{ zebras}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average number of stripes:**
   The average number of stripes per zebra is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the total number of zebras:
   \[
   \text{Average stripes} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Total zebras}} = \frac{88}{4}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

Thus, the average number of stripes on the zebras is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each.
- Jane counts a zebra with 36 stripes.
- Jane counts another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of stripes on all the zebras.
Zebra 1: 17 stripes
Zebra 2: 17 stripes
Zebra 3: 36 stripes
Zebra 4: 36 stripes / 2 = 18 stripes

Total number of stripes = 17 + 17 + 36 + 18 =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of zebras and their respective stripes:**

   - Two zebras with 17 stripes each.
   - One zebra with 36 stripes.
   - One zebra with half of 36 stripes.

2. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**

   - For the two zebras with 17 stripes each:
     \[
     2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
     \]

   - For the zebra with 36 stripes:
     \[
     36 \text{ stri...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the zebras and their stripes:
* 2 zebras with 17 stripes each
* 1 zebra with 36 stripes
* 1 zebra with half of 36 stripes (which is 18 stripes)

2. Let's calculate the total number of stripes:
* First two zebras: 17 + 17 = 34 stripes
* Third zebra: 36 stripes
* Fourth zebra: 36 รท 2 = 18 stripes
* Total stripes = 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes

3. To find the average, we need:
* Total number of ze...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out the total number of stripes on all the zebras. 

Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.

Then, there's a zebra with 36 stripes.

And another zebra with half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes, so that's 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

So, the total number of stripes on all the zebras is 34 (from the first two zebras) + 36 (from the third zebra) + 18 (from the fourth zebra) = 88 stripes.

The average number o...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are four zebras in total.
   * Two zebras have 17 stripes each.
   * One zebra has 36 stripes.
   * The last zebra has half the number of stripes as the zebra with 36 stripes.

2. Calculate the number of stripes on the last zebra:
   * The last zebra has half the stripes of the zebra with 36 stripes.
   * Half of 36 is 36 รท 2 = 18 stripes.

3. Calculate the...
