=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of onions needed
Antoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. Since he likes to double that amount:

\[
\text{Amount of onions needed} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the onions
The onions are on sale for $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the onions is:

\[
\text{Cost of onions} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the beef stock
Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are also on sale for $2.00 per box. Thus, the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[
\text{Cost of beef stock} = 2 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the ingredients
Now, we add the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of onions} + \text{Cost of beef stock} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the cost per serving
The soup serves 6 people. To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[
\text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{12 \text{ dollars}}{6 \text{ servings}} = 2 \text{ dollars/serving}
\]

### Final Answer
The cost per serving of Antoine's french onion soup is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Calculate the total cost of onions:
* Recipe calls for 2 pounds, but Antoine doubles it = 4 pounds
* Cost per pound = $2.00
* Total onion cost = 4 pounds × $2.00 = $8.00

2. Calculate the cost of beef stock:
* Needs 2 boxes
* Cost per box = $2.00
* Total stock cost = 2 boxes × $2.00 = $4.00

3. Calculate total cost of ingredients:
* Total cost = Onion cost + Stock cost
* Total cost = $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine likes to double the amount of onions in his recipe, so instead of 2 pounds, he uses 4 pounds. At $2.00 a pound, the total cost of the onions is 4 * $2.00 = $8.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the beef stock. He needs 2 boxes, and each box is $2.00, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

Now, let's add the cost of the onions and the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredie...
