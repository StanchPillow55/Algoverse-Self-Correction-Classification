=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of birds scared away by Jeremy.**
2. **Calculate the number of birds remaining after some were scared away.**
3. **Add the new birds that joined the remaining birds.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of birds scared away

Jeremy saw 12 birds in total. He scared away \( \frac{1}{3} \) of these birds. 

To find out how many birds this is, we calculate:
\[
\text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of birds remaining

Now, we subtract the number of birds that were scared away from the total number of birds:
\[
\text{Remaining birds} = \text{Total birds} - \text{Birds scared away} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Add the new birds that joined

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. We add these new birds to the number of remaining birds:
\[
\text{Total birds now} = \text{Remaining birds} + \text{New birds} = 8 + 20 = 28
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jeremy saw 12 birds in their backyard.
- He threw a stone at them, scaring away 1/3 of that number.
- A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds.

Step 1: Calculate the number of birds that were scared away.
1/3 of 12 birds = 12 × 1/3 = 4 birds

Step 2: Calculate the number of birds that remained after the stone was thrown.
Number of birds remaining = Total birds...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events described and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Birds:**
   Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Scaring Away Birds:**
   Jeremy threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of the birds. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12.

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]

   So, 4 birds were scared away.

3. **Remaining Birds:**
   After ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many birds flew away when Jeremy threw the stone
* Initial number of birds = 12
* Fraction that flew away = 1/3
* Number of birds that flew away = 12 × (1/3) = 4 birds

2. Calculate how many birds remained after some flew away
* Birds remaining = Initial birds - Birds that flew away
* Birds remaining = 12 - 4 = 8 birds

3. Add the new birds that joined later
* Birds remaining + New birds = T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many birds Jeremy scared away. We know he scared away 1/3 of the 12 birds he initially saw. 

To find 1/3 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/3:

12 * 1/3 = 4 birds

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. 

Next, we subtract the number of birds that were scared away from the total number of birds Jeremy initially saw to find out how many birds remained:

12 - 4 = 8 birds

So, 8 birds remained in the backyard after Jeremy scared some away. 

Then, 20 more bi...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, there were 12 birds in the backyard.
   * Jeremy scared away 1/3 of the birds.
   * Later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds.

2. Calculate the number of birds that were scared away:
   * 1/3 of 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4 birds
   So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds.

3. Calculate the number of birds remaining after Jeremy scared some away:
   * Remaining birds...
