=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizzas for the soccer game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}
     \]
   - Additionally, there are 3 coaches.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas are needed:**
   - Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed for 39 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
     \[
     \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Since we cannot order a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 39 is exactly divisible by 3, so we need 13 pizzas.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the pizzas:**
   - Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
     \[
     13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Maddy will spend a total of **$195** on pizzas for the soccer game.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{195}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 12 team members
- There are 3 coaches
- Each team member brings 2 guests
- A pizza will serve 3 people
- Each pizza costs $15

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to feed.
Total people = Team members + Coaches + Guests
Total people = 12 + 3 + (12 × 2) = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of pizzas needed.
Number of pizzas = Total people / ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy and then calculate the total cost based on the price per pizza.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people.**

- There are 12 team members.
- Each team member brings 2 guests, so the number of guests is \(12 \times 2 = 24\).
- There are 3 coaches.

Adding these together gives the total number of people:
\[
12 \text{ (team members)} + 24 \text{ (guests)} + 3 \text{ (coaches)} = 39 \text{ p...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of people:
* Team members: 12
* Coaches: 3
* Guests: Each team member brings 2 guests
  * Number of guests = 12 team members × 2 guests = 24 guests
* Total people = Team members + Coaches + Guests
* Total people = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people

2. Now, let's calculate how many pizzas are needed:
* Each pizza serves 3 people
* Number of pizzas = Total people ÷ People per pizza
* N...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of people Maddy needs to feed. There are 12 team members, 3 coaches, and each team member brings 2 guests. So, the total number of people is 12 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 12*2 (guests) = 12 + 3 + 24 = 39 people.

Next, we need to determine how many pizzas Maddy needs to buy. Since each pizza serves 3 people, she needs to buy 39 (people) / 3 (people per pizza) = 13 pizzas.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost. Since...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the total number of people:
   * There are 12 team members and 3 coaches, so that's 12 + 3 = 15 people.
   * Each team member brings 2 guests, so that's an additional 12 × 2 = 24 people.
   * Total number of people = Team members and coaches + Guests
   * Total number of people = 15 + 24 = 39 people

2. Calculate the number of pizzas needed:
   * Each pizza serves 3 people.
   * Number of pizzas n...
