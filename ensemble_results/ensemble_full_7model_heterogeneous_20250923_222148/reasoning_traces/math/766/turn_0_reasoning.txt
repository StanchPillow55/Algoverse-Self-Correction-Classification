=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much money Marissa has left after buying the ball.**
2. **Calculate how many candy bars she can buy with the remaining money.**

### Step 1: Calculate Remaining Money After Buying the Ball

Marissa initially has $80. She buys a ball for $20. We need to subtract the cost of the ball from her initial amount:

\[
\text{Remaining Money} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Cost of the Ball}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining Money} = 80 - 20 = 60
\]

So, Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball.

### Step 2: Calculate How Many Candy Bars She Can Buy

Next, we know that each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars Marissa can buy with her remaining $60, we will divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar:

\[
\text{Number of Candy Bars} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost of One Candy Bar}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of Candy Bars} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

### Final Answer

Marissa can buy **12 candy bars** for Jimmy.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Marissa initially had $80. After buying the ball for $20, she was left with $80 - $20 = $60.

The candy bars are sold at $5 each. To find out how many candy bars Marissa bought for Jimmy, we need to divide the total amount of money she had left by the price of each candy bar.

So, $60 รท $5 = 12.

Therefore, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.
