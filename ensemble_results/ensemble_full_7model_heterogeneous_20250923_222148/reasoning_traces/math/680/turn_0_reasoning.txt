=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of adults**: 
   Jack is riding with 8 other adults, so the total number of adults is:
   \[
   1 \text{ (Jack)} + 8 \text{ (other adults)} = 9 \text{ adults}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the adults**: 
   Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of all 9 adults can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Average weight per adult}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Determine the maximum load of the elevator**: 
   The maximum load that the elevator can support is given as 700 kg.

4. **Calculate the excess weight**: 
   To find out how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = \text{Total weight} - \text{Maximum load}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Excess weight} = 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   The total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by } 20 \text{ kg.}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator and then find the difference between the total weight and the maximum load of the elevator.

Given information:
- The elevator supports a maximum load of 700 kg.
- An adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults.

Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator.
Total weight = Weight of Jack + Weight of 8 other...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults riding the elevator, and then compare this total weight to the maximum load capacity of the elevator.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people in the elevator.**

Jack is riding the elevator with 8 other adults. Therefore, the total number of people in the elevator is:

\[ 1 + 8 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the 9 people.**

Each adult weighs an average of...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Maximum elevator load = 700 kg
* Average adult weight = 80 kg
* Number of people = Jack + 8 others = 9 people total

2. Calculate the total weight of all people:
* Total weight = Number of people × Average weight
* Total weight = 9 × 80 kg
* Total weight = 720 kg

3. Calculate how much they exceed the maximum load:
* Amount exceeded = Total weight - Maximum load
...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults. Since an adult weighs an average of 80 kg, we can multiply this by the number of adults to find the total weight.

So, the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults is 80 kg * 9 = 720 kg.

Next, we need to find out by how much this total weight exceeds the maximum load of the elevator. To do this, we subtract the maximum load of the elevator from the total weight of the adults.

So, the amount b...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The elevator's maximum load is 700 kg.
- An adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
- Jack rides the elevator with 8 other adults.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of adults in the elevator.
Total adults = Jack + Other adults
Total adults = 1 + 8 = 9

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of all adults in the elevator.
Total weight = Number of adults × Average weight per adult
Total weight...
