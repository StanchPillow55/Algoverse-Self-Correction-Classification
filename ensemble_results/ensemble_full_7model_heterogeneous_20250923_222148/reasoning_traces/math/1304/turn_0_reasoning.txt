=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find out how many students Butler High School enrolls on average and then determine the difference between the average enrollments of Norman High School and Butler High School.

1. **Identify the average enrollment at Norman High School:**
   - According to the problem, Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students each year.

2. **Calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School:**
   - The problem states that Butler High School enrolls an average of \( \frac{3}{4} \) as many students as Norman High School.
   - To find the average enrollment at Butler High School, we multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
   \[
   \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = \frac{3 \times 4000}{4} = \frac{12000}{4} = 3000
   \]
   - Therefore, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students each year.

4. **Calculate the difference in average enrollment:**
   - Now, we need to find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is compared to Butler High School:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Average enrollment at Norman High School} - \text{Average enrollment at Butler High School}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
   \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   - The average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
