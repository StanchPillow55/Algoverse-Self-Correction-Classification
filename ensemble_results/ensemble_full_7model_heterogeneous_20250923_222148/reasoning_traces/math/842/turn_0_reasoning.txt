=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much change Thea received after purchasing the hat, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of the hat**: The cost of the hat is given as $70.

2. **Determine the amount Thea paid**: Thea paid with four $20 bills. We need to calculate the total amount she paid:
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the change**: To find out how much change Thea received, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of the hat}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 80 - 70 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The amount of change Thea received is $10.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* The hat costs $70
* Thea paid with four $20 bills

2. Calculate how much money Thea gave:
* 4 × $20 = $80 total payment

3. Calculate the change:
* Change = Amount paid - Cost of hat
* Change = $80 - $70 = $10

Reasoning:
* Since Thea paid more than the cost of the hat, she will receive change
* The difference between what she paid ($80) and the cost ($70) is her...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, which is a total of 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.

The hat she bought was worth $70, so the craftsman needs to give her change.

To find out how much change she got, we subtract the cost of the hat from the amount she gave the craftsman.

So, $80 - $70 = $<<80-70=10>>10.

Therefore, Thea got $10 in change.

Given information:
- Thea bought a hat worth $70.
- She gave the craftsman four $20 bills.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Thea gave to the craftsman.
Total amount given = Number of $20 bills × Value of each bill
Total amount given = 4 × $20
Total amount given = $80

Step 2: Calculate the change Thea should receive.
