=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Gabriel still needs to buy the car and the phone, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.**
   - The cost of the car is $10,000.
   - The cost of the phone is $800.
   - We will add these two amounts together to find the total cost.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Car} + \text{Cost of Phone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10000 + 800 = 10800
   \]

2. **Calculate Gabriel's total available funds.**
   - Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
   - His brother gave him $200.
   - We will add these two amounts together to find Gabriel's total available funds.

   \[
   \text{Total Available Funds} = \text{Gabriel's Money} + \text{Brother's Contribution}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Available Funds} = 5000 + 200 = 5200
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Gabriel needs.**
   - We will subtract Gabriel's total available funds from the total cost of the car and phone to find out how much more money he needs.

   \[
   \text{Money Needed} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Total Available Funds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money Needed} = 10800 - 5200 = 5600
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy the car and the phone.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5600}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total cost of what Gabriel wants to buy:
   * Car cost: $10,000
   * Phone cost: $800
   * Total cost = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800

2. Now, let's add up how much money Gabriel has:
   * Money from working: $5,000
   * Money from brother: $200
   * Total money available = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200

3. To find how much more money Gabriel needs:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Gabriel needs in total to buy both the car and the phone. 

The cost of the car is $10000 and the cost of the phone is $800. 

So, the total cost is $10000 (for the car) + $800 (for the phone) = $10800.

Now, we need to find out how much money Gabriel already has. 

He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 

So, the total money Gabriel has is $5000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200.
