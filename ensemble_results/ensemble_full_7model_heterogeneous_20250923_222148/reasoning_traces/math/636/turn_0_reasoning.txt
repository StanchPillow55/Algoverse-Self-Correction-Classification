=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a day and then calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, she processes twice the number of customers that Jewel does in the same time period.

2. **Calculating Julie's Daily Production**:
   - Since Jewel processes 50 customers per day, and Julie processes twice as many:
   \[
   \text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily production} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
   \]

3. **Calculating Total Daily Production**:
   - Now, we can find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = \text{Jewel's daily production} + \text{Julie's daily production} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]

4. **Calculating Weekly Production**:
   - They work all days of the week, which means they work 7 days. To find the total weekly production, we multiply the total daily production by the number of days in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times 7 = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel is:
   \[
   \boxed{1050} \text{ customers}
   \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Jewel processes 50 customers per day
* Julie works twice as fast as Jewel
* We need to find their combined weekly total
* A week has 7 days

2. Calculate Julie's daily customer count:
* Julie = 2 × Jewel
* Julie = 2 × 50 = 100 customers per day

3. Calculate their combined daily total:
* Daily total = Julie + Jewel
* Daily total = 100 + 50 = 150 customers per day

4. C...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel. This means that if Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers a day.

Therefore, the total number of customers that both of them process in a day is 100 (Julie) + 50 (Jewel) = 150 customers.

If they work all 7 days of the week, the total number of customers they process in a week is 150 customers/day * 7 days/week = 1050 customers/week.

So, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel i...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   * Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.
   * They work all days of the week.

2. Calculate how many customers Julie processes per day:
   * Julie's speed = 2 × Jewel's speed
   * Julie's daily customers = 2 × 50
   * Julie's daily customers = 100

3. Calculate the total number of customers processed by both Ju...
