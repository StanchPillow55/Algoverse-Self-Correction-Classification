=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many hours Tyler needs to work to afford the books he wants, we first need to calculate the total cost of the books and then see how much more money he needs after using his saved allowance.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the books

1. **Cost of the dictionary**: $18
2. **Cost of the dinosaur book**: $13
3. **Cost of the children's cookbook**: $8

Now, we add these costs together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 18 + 13 + 8
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- First, add the cost of the dictionary and the dinosaur book:
  \[
  18 + 13 = 31
  \]

- Next, add the cost of the children's cookbook:
  \[
  31 + 8 = 39
  \]

Thus, the total cost of the books is **$39**.

### Step 2: Determine how much more money Tyler needs

Tyler has saved **$14** from his allowance. We need to find out how much more he needs to reach the total cost of the books.

\[
\text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Saved money}
\]
\[
\text{Additional money needed} = 39 - 14
\]

Calculating this:

\[
39 - 14 = 25
\]

So, Tyler needs an additional **$25**.

### Step 3: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work

Tyler earns **$5 per hour**. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the additional $25, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Additional money needed}}{\text{Earnings per hour}}
\]
\[
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{25}{5}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{25}{5} = 5
\]

### Final Answer

Tyler needs to work **5 hours** to afford the books he wants.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total cost of all the books:
* Dictionary: $18
* Dinosaur book: $13
* Cookbook: $8
* Total cost = $18 + $13 + $8 = $39

2. Tyler already has $14 saved
* Amount still needed = Total cost - Savings
* Amount needed = $39 - $14 = $25

3. Tyler earns $5 per hour
* To find hours needed: Amount needed รท Hourly rate
* Hours = $25 รท $5 = 5 hours

Let me verify:
* 5 hours ร $5 per hour = $25 additiona...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much all the books cost in total. 

The cost of the dictionary is $18, the dinosaur book is $13, and the children's cookbook is $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14. We subtract this from the total cost of the books to find out how much more money Tyler needs to earn. 

So, $39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the total amount ...
