=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total number of bananas required by each type of ape for one month, and then multiply that by 2 to find the total for two months.

1. **Calculate the monthly banana requirements for each type of ape:**
   - **Monkeys:** 200 bananas per month
   - **Gorillas:** 400 bananas per month
   - **Baboons:** 100 bananas per month

2. **Add the monthly requirements together:**
   \[
   \text{Total monthly bananas} = \text{Monkeys} + \text{Gorillas} + \text{Baboons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total monthly bananas} = 200 + 400 + 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total monthly bananas} = 700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total banana requirements for 2 months:**
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = \text{Total monthly bananas} \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 700 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total bananas for 2 months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
   \]

Thus, the zookeeper needs to order **1400 bananas** to last for 2 months.

**Final Answer: 1400 bananas**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.
- The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

To find the total number of bananas needed for 2 months, we need to calculate the monthly banana requirements and then multiply it by 2 months.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required for all the apes in the zoo over a 2-month period. We will break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the monthly banana requirement for each type of ape:**

   - **Monkeys:** The monkeys need 200 bananas every month.
   - **Gorillas:** The gorillas need 400 bananas every month.
   - **Baboons:** The baboons need 100 bananas every month.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the monthly banana needs for each type of ape:
* Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
* Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
* Baboons: 100 bananas per month

2. Calculate total bananas needed per month:
* Monthly total = Monkeys + Gorillas + Baboons
* Monthly total = 200 + 400 + 100
* Monthly total = 700 bananas per month

3. Calculate bananas needed for 2 months:
* 2-month total = Monthly total Ã— 2
*...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many bananas each type of ape needs for 2 months. 

Since the monkeys need 200 bananas every month, for 2 months, they will need:
200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas

The gorillas need 400 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they will need:
400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas

The baboons need 100 bananas every month, so for 2 months, they will need:
100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Now, we add up all the bananas n...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months.
   * Monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
   * Gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
   * Baboons need 100 bananas per month.

2. Calculate the total number of bananas needed per month:
   * Bananas for monkeys per month = 200
   * Bananas for gorillas per month = 400
   * Bananas for baboons per month = 100
   * Total bananas...
