=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of both the red car and the blue car based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the price of the blue car**: 
   The problem states that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Calculate the price of the red car**: 
   The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we first need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price.

   \[
   \text{40% of blue car's price} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40
   \]

   This means the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car.

3. **Determine the price of the red car**: 
   To find the price of the red car, we subtract the discount from the blue car's price.

   \[
   \text{Price of red car} = \text{Price of blue car} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of red car} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Summarize the costs**: 
   - The price of the blue car is $100.
   - The price of the red car is $60.

5. **Final answer**: 
   The costs of both cars are:
   - Blue car: $100
   - Red car: $60

Thus, the final answer is:
- The blue car costs $100.
- The red car costs $60.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
- The price of the blue car is $100.

Step 1: Calculate the price of the red car.
Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, that means the red car's price is 60% of the blue car's price.
Price of the red car = 60% of $100 = 0.60 × $100 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of both cars.
Total cost = Price of the blue car + Price of the ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of both the red car and the blue car, given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Price of the Blue Car:**
   - The problem states that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Determine the Discount on the Red Car:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* The blue car costs $100
* The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car

2. To find the price of the red car:
* 40% cheaper means the red car costs 60% of the blue car's price
* 60% = 0.60
* Red car price = $100 × 0.60
* Red car price = $60

3. To find total cost of both cars:
* Total = Blue car + Red car
* Total = $100 + $60
* Total = $160

Therefore:
* The blue car costs $10...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. The price of the blue car is given as $100. 

To find the price of the red car, we need to calculate 40% of the price of the blue car and then subtract that from the price of the blue car. 

Step 1: Calculate 40% of the price of the blue car
40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Step 2: Subtract this from the price of the blue car to find the price of the red car
Price of red car = Price of blue car - 40% of...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the cost of the red car and then add it to the cost of the blue car to determine the total cost of both cars.

Given:
- The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car.
- The price of the blue car is $100.

Step 1: Calculate the price difference between the blue car and the red car.
Price difference = 40% of the blue car's price
Price difference = 0.40 × $100 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the price o...
