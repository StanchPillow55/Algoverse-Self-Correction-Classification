=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Walter has collected from his neighbors and the online fund.**
   - Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
   - Walter collects $1500 from the online fund.
   
   We can find the total amount collected by adding these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total from neighbors and online fund} = 500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]

2. **Add the amount Walter's friend gives him.**
   - Walter's friend gives him $200.
   
   Now we add this amount to the total collected so far:

   \[
   \text{Total amount collected} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

3. **Determine how much Walter's lawyer will donate.**
   - Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times the total amount collected by Walter from everyone else (which includes the neighbors, the online fund, and the friend).
   
   Therefore, we calculate the lawyer's contribution as follows:

   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times \text{Total amount collected}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2200 = 6600
   \]

4. **Final answer.**
   - Walter's lawyer is going to contribute **$6600**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6600}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify all the donations Walter collected before telling his lawyer:
   * Neighbors: $500
   * Online fund: $1,500
   * Friend: $200

2. Calculate the total donations before lawyer's contribution:
   * Total = $500 + $1,500 + $200
   * Total = $2,200

3. The lawyer will donate three times this amount:
   * Lawyer's contribution = $2,200 Ã— 3
   * Lawyer's contribution = $6,600

Reasoning:
* We need ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Walter has collected before his lawyer makes a donation. 

He collected $500 from his neighbors and $1500 from the online fund. 

So, $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Then, his friend gives him an additional $200. 

So, $2000 (from neighbors and online fund) + $200 (from friend) = $2200

Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates. 

So, the lawyer's contribution will be 3...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's calculate the total amount Walter collected before his friend's contribution:
   * From his neighbors: $500
   * From the online fund: $1500
   * Total collected = $500 + $1500 = $2000

2. Now, Walter's friend contributes $200.
   * Friend's contribution: $200
   * New total = Previous total + Friend's contribution
   * New total = $2000 + $200 = $2200

3. Walter's lawyer has offered to donate ...
