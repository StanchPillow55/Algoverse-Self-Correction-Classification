Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of candies that James, Robert, and John have.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( R \) be the number of candies Robert has.
   - According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can express the number of candies James has as:
     \[
     J = R + 6
     \]
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     Jn = 2R
     \]

2. **Use the information given about John:**
   - We know that John has 54 candies:
     \[
     Jn = 54
     \]
   - From the equation \( Jn = 2R \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]

3. **Solve for \( R \):**
   - To find \( R \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of candies James has:**
   - Now that we know \( R \), we can find the number of candies James has using the equation \( J = R + 6 \):
     \[
     J = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

5. **Determine how many more candies John has than James:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number of candies James has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = Jn - J = 54 - 33
     \]
   - Calculate the difference:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 21
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James has 6 more candies than Robert.
- John has twice as many candies as Robert.
- John has 54 candies.

Step 1: Find how many candies Robert has.
Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, we can use the following equation:
John's candies = 2 × Robert's candies
54 = 2 × Robert's candies
Robert's candies = 54 / 2 = 27 candies

Step 2: Find how many candies James has.
James has 6 mor...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candies each person has and then find the difference between the number of candies John has and the number James has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( R \) represent the number of candies Robert has.
- According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, John has \( 2R \) candies.
- We are given that John has 54 candies. So, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2R = 54
  \]

**Step 1: Solve...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* John has twice as many candies as Robert
* John has 54 candies
* James has 6 more candies than Robert

2. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert:
* John = 2 × Robert
* 54 = 2 × Robert
* Therefore, Robert = 54 ÷ 2 = 27 candies

3. Now we can find how many candies James has:
* James = Robert + 6
* James = 27 + 6 = 33 candies

4. To find how many more candies John has th...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation 2R = 54, where R represents the number of candies Robert has. Solving for R, we get R = 54/2 = 27. So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, let's figure out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can set up the equation J = R + 6, where J represents the number of candies James h...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to determine the number of candies each person has, and then find the difference between John and James' candies.

Given:
- James has 6 more candies than Robert.
- John has twice as many candies as Robert.
- John has 54 candies.

Step 1: Let's express Robert's candies in terms of a variable, say 'x'.
Robert's candies = x

Step 2: Express James' candies in terms of Robert's....
