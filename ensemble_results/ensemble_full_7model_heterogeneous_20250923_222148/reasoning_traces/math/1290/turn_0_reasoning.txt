=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sunflower seeds from both the small and large sunflowers.

1. **Calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we can calculate the number of seeds in the small sunflower as follows:
     \[
     \text{Seeds in small sunflower} = 3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ seeds/dozen} = 36 \text{ seeds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of seeds in the large sunflower:**
   - The problem states that a large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   - First, we need to calculate 50% of the number of seeds in the small sunflower:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 36 \text{ seeds} = 0.5 \times 36 = 18 \text{ seeds}
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the number of seeds in the small sunflower to find the total number of seeds in the large sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Seeds in large sunflower} = 36 \text{ seeds} + 18 \text{ seeds} = 54 \text{ seeds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sunflower seeds:**
   - Now that we have the number of seeds in both the small and large sunflowers, we can find the total number of seeds:
     \[
     \text{Total seeds} = \text{Seeds in small sunflower} + \text{Seeds in large sunflower}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total seeds} = 36 \text{ seeds} + 54 \text{ seeds} = 90 \text{ seeds}
     \]

Thus, the total number of sunflower seeds altogether is \(\boxed{90}\).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
- A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.

Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower.
1 dozen = 12 seeds
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds

Step 2: Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower.
A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
50% of 36 seeds = 0.5 × 36 = 18 seeds
Number of seeds in a large s...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sunflower seeds from both the small and large sunflowers.

**Step 1: Determine the number of seeds in a small sunflower.**

The problem states that a small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds. Since one dozen equals 12, we calculate the number of seeds in a small sunflower as follows:

\[
3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
\]

So, a small sunflower has 36 seeds.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many seeds are in a small sunflower
   * 1 dozen = 12
   * 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 seeds in a small sunflower

2. Now, let's find how many seeds are in a large sunflower
   * Large sunflower has 50% more seeds than small sunflower
   * 50% = 0.5 = 1/2
   * Additional seeds = 36 × 0.5 = 18 seeds
   * Total seeds in large sunflower = 36 + 18 = 54 seeds

3. Calculate total seeds from both sunflow...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many seeds a small sunflower has. We know that it has 3 dozen seeds. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to find the total number of seeds in a small sunflower.

3 dozen * 12 = 36 seeds

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. We know that it has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find this, we calculate 50% of the number of seeds in a small sunflower and add that to the number of seeds in a small sunf...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.
   * A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.

2. Convert dozens to a number:
   * 1 dozen = 12
   * 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36
   So, a small sunflower has 36 seeds.

3. Calculate the number of seeds in a large sunflower:
   * A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower.
   * 50% of 36 = 0.5 × 36 = 18...
