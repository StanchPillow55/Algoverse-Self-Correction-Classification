=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of boys at Small Tree School.**
2. **Calculate the number of boys who were absent on Friday.**
3. **Find the number of boys present on Friday.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of boys

We know that there are a total of 96 fourth-graders, and 43 of them are girls. To find the number of boys, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of boys} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of girls}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 96 - 43 = 53
\]

So, there are 53 boys at Small Tree School.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of boys who were absent on Friday

According to the problem, 5 girls and 4 boys were absent on Friday. We need to focus on the boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys absent} = 4
\]

### Step 3: Find the number of boys present on Friday

To find the number of boys who were present on Friday, we subtract the number of boys who were absent from the total number of boys:

\[
\text{Number of boys present} = \text{Total boys} - \text{Boys absent}
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys present} = 53 - 4 = 49
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of fourth-grade boys who were at Small Tree School on Friday is:

\[
\boxed{49}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of boys in fourth grade
* Total fourth-graders = 96
* Number of girls = 43
* Number of boys = Total - Girls
* Number of boys = 96 - 43 = 53 boys

2. Now, let's find how many boys were present on Friday
* Total boys = 53
* Boys absent = 4
* Boys present = Total boys - Absent boys
* Boys present = 53 - 4 = 49 boys

Therefore, 49 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Frida...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of fourth-grade boys in Small Tree School. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. 

So, the number of boys is the total number of fourth-graders minus the number of girls. 

That is, 96 (total fourth-graders) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys).

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. So, the number of boys present at school on Friday is the total number of boys minus the number of boys absent.
