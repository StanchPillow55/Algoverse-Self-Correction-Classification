=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.**
   - Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
   - Millie makes 3 pitchers.
   - Total cups of lemonade = Number of pitchers × Cups per pitcher
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups/pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade.**
   - Millie sells each cup for $1.
   - Total revenue = Total cups × Price per cup
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ cups} \times 1 \text{ dollar/cup} = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies.**
   - Millie spends $18 on supplies.

4. **Calculate the profit.**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 18 \text{ dollars} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how long Millie runs her lemonade stand.**
   - Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
   - To find out how many hours she needs to run the stand to sell all 36 cups, we divide the total cups by the average cups sold per hour.
   \[
   \text{Hours open} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per hour}} = \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour.**
   - Profit per hour = Total profit / Hours open
   \[
   \text{Profit per hour} = \frac{18 \text{ dollars}}{9 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that Millie makes a profit of **$2 per hour** that she spends running the lemonade stand.

**Final Answer: $2 per hour**

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Millie's profit per hour from her lemonade stand. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Total Revenue
First, calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make with 3 pitchers.

- Each pitcher holds 12 cups.
- Millie has 3 pitchers.

\[
3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
\]

Next, calculate the total revenue if she sells all 36 cups at $1 per cup.

\[

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make:
* 3 pitchers × 12 cups per pitcher = 36 total cups

2. Calculate total potential revenue:
* Each cup sells for $1
* 36 cups × $1 = $36 total revenue

3. Calculate profit (before considering time):
* Revenue - Costs = Profit
* $36 - $18 = $18 total profit

4. Calculate time needed to sell all lemonade:
* Millie sells 4 cups per hour
* Total cu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many cups of lemonade Millie can make from the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, let's find out how much money she will make if she sells all of the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, she will make 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, let's find out how much profit she will make. Profit is the amount of money made (revenue) minus the cost of the supplies. S...
