=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of copies sold by Harald as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald. Therefore, we can express the number of copies sold by Marilyn as \( 10H \).

The problem states that the total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald combined is 88,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000
\]

Now, we can simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
11H = 88,000
\]

Next, we need to solve for \( H \). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
H = 8,000
\]

Thus, Harald sold 8,000 copies.

To find out how many copies Marilyn sold, we can substitute \( H \) back into the expression for Marilyn's sales:

\[
\text{Copies sold by Marilyn} = 10H = 10 \times 8,000 = 80,000
\]

Finally, we can verify our solution by checking the total sales:

\[
H + 10H = 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000
\]

Since the total matches the given information, our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Harald sold } 8,000 \text{ copies.}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
- They sold 88,000 copies combined.

Let's represent the number of copies Harald sold as "x".

Since Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, we can represent Marilyn's sales as "10x".

The total number of copies sold is the sum of Harald's and Marilyn's sales:
Harald's sales + Marilyn's sales = Total copie...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the number of copies Harald sold.
- \( M \) as the number of copies Marilyn sold.

According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. This can be expressed as:
\[ M = 10H \]

We are also told that together they sold 88,000 copies. This gives us the equation:
\[ H + M = 88,000 \]

Now, we have a system of two equations:
1. \( M =...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define what we know:
   * Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many as Harald's
   * Together they sold 88,000 copies
   * Let's say Harald sold 'x' copies

2) We can write an equation:
   * Harald's copies = x
   * Marilyn's copies = 10x
   * Total copies = 88,000
   * So: x + 10x = 88,000

3) Simplify the left side of equation:
   * x + 10x = 11x
   * 11x = 88,000

4) Solve for x:
   * x = 88,000 รท 11
   * x...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so we can denote the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10H.

The problem states that together they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

H (Harald's sales) + 10H (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000

Combining like terms gives us:

11H = 88,000

To find the value of H (the number of copies Harald sold), we ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out how many copies Harald sold, given the total combined sales and the ratio of Marilyn's sales to Harald's.

Given:
- Marilyn's first record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.
- They sold a combined total of 88,000 copies.

Step 1: Let's express Marilyn's sales in terms of Harald's.
Marilyn's sales = 10 ร Harald's sales

Step 2: Express the total sales in terms of Harald's sales.
