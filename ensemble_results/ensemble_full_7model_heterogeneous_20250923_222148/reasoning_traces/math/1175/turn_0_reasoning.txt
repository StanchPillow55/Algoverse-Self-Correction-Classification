=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- In the first half of the soccer match, team A scores 4 goals.
- In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A.
- In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.
- In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.
Team B's goals in the first half = Team A's goals in the first half - 2
Team B's goals in the first half = 4 - 2 = 2 goals

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
Team B's goals in the second half = 4 × Team B's goals in the first half
Team B's goals in the second half = 4 × 2 = 8 goals

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.
Team A's goals in the

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

### First Half Goals
1. **Team A's Goals**: Team A scores 4 goals.
   \[
   \text{Goals by Team A in the first half} = 4
   \]

2. **Team B's Goals**: Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A.
   \[
   \text{Goals by Team B in the first half} = 4 - 2 = 2
   \]

### Total Goals in the First Half
Now, we can calculate the total number of goal...

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- In the first half of the soccer match, team A scores 4 goals.
- In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A.
- In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.
- In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of goals scored by each team in both halves of the match and then sum them up to find the total number of goals scored in the match.

### First Half:

1. **Team A's Goals:**
   - Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.

2. **Team B's Goals:**
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A in the first half.
   - Therefore, Team B scores \(4 - 2 = 2\) goals in the first half.

### Second Half:

1. **Team B's Goals:**
 ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First half goals:
* Team A scores 4 goals
* Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A
* So Team B scores: 4 - 2 = 2 goals in first half

2. Second half goals for Team B:
* Team B scores 4 times its first half goals
* First half Team B scored 2 goals
* So second half Team B scores: 2 × 4 = 8 goals

3. Second half goals for Team A:
* Team A scores 1/4 of Team B's second half goals
* Team B scored 8 goals in second ha...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): In the first half of the match, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

To find the total number of goals scored in th...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- In the first half, team A scores 4 goals.
- In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A.
- In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.
- In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals team B scored in the first half.
Team B's goals in the first half = Team A'...
