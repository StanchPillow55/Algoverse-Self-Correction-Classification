=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Emma's age based on the information provided about Mia's age and the age difference between them.

1. **Identify Mia's Age**: 
   - Mia is currently 40 years old.

2. **Determine the Age Difference**: 
   - We know that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age.

3. **Calculate Emma's Age**: 
   - Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding the age difference to Mia's age:
   \[
   \text{Emma's Age} = \text{Mia's Age} + \text{Age Difference}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Emma's Age} = 40 + 16 = 56
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average of Their Ages**: 
   - The average age is calculated by adding both ages together and dividing by 2:
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{\text{Mia's Age} + \text{Emma's Age}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{40 + 56}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   - The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is \( \boxed{48} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Mia and Emma are currently 16 years apart in age.
- Mia, who is younger than Emma, is 40 years old.

Step 1: Find Emma's age.
Since Mia is 40 years old and 16 years younger than Emma, we can add 16 to Mia's age to find Emma's age.
Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

Step 2: Calculate the average of Mia and Emma's ages.
Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age)...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of both Mia and Emma and then find the average of their ages.

1. **Identify Mia's Age:**
   - We are given that Mia is 40 years old.

2. **Determine Emma's Age:**
   - We know that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age, with Mia being the younger one.
   - Therefore, Emma's age can be calculated by adding the age difference to Mia's age:
     \[
     \text{Emma's age} = \text{Mia's age} + 16 = 40 + 16 = 56
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Mia is 40 years old
* Mia is younger than Emma
* They are 16 years apart in age

2. Since Mia is younger and they're 16 years apart:
* Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
* Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

3. To find the average of their ages:
* Average = (Sum of values) รท (Number of values)
* Average = (Mia's age + Emma's age) รท 2
* Average = (40 + 56) รท 2
* Average = 96 รท 2
* A...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Given that Mia is 40 years old and the age difference between Mia and Emma is 16 years, we can find Emma's age by adding the age difference to Mia's age.

Emma's age = Mia's age + Age difference
Emma's age = 40 years + 16 years = 56 years

The average of their ages is calculated by adding their ages together and dividing by the number of people, which is 2 in this case.

Average age = (Mia's age + Emma's age) / 2
Average age = (40 years + 56 years) / 2 = 96 years / 2 = 48...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mia and Emma have an age difference of 16 years.
   * Mia is younger than Emma.
   * Mia is currently 40 years old.

2. Find Emma's current age:
   * Since Mia is younger than Emma and they have an age difference of 16 years, we can find Emma's age by adding 16 to Mia's age.
   * Emma's age = Mia's age + 16
   * Emma's age = 40 + 16 = 56 years old

3. Calculate t...
