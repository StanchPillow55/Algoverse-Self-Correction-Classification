=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores in the video game, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( E \) = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( B \) = the number of berries Emma collects
- \( T \) = the time (in seconds) Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know the following:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma, so she collects \( B + 3 \) berries.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, so she has \( T - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Now we can express the scores for both players using the scoring rules:
- Points for jumping on enemies: 10 points per enemy
- Points for collecting berries: 5 points per berry
- Points for time left on the timer: 30 points per second

### Score Calculation

**Emma's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10E + 5B + 30T
\]

**Ava's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4)
\]

Now, let's simplify Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
\]

### Finding the Difference in Scores

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores we calculated:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10E + 5B + 30T - 25) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
\]
The \( 10E \), \( 5B \), and \( 30T \) terms cancel out:
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between Ava's and Emma's scores is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores in the video game, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( E \) = the number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( B \) = the number of berries Emma collects
- \( T \) = the time (in seconds) Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level

From the problem, we know the following:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma, so she jumps on \( E + 8 \) enemies.
- Ava collects 3 more ber...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ava and Emma each play one level of the video game.
- They receive:
  - 10 points for every enemy they jump on
  - 5 points for each berry they collect
  - 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.

Step 1: Calculate Ava's sco...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the given conditions and then find the difference between their scores.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( E_e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( B_e \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( T_e \) be the number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level.

According to the problem:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( E_a = E_e + 8 \)...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify the scoring system:
* 10 points per enemy jumped on
* 5 points per berry collected
* 30 points per second remaining

2. Let's say Emma's values are x for enemies and y for berries
* Then Ava's values would be (x + 8) enemies and (y + 3) berries
* If Ava finishes 4 seconds slower, her time remaining would be 4 seconds less than Emma's

3. Let's calculate the difference in points for each category:

--- Model 5 Response ---
Model 5 (replicate:meta/meta-llama-3-70b): REPLICATE_API_ERROR: ReplicateError Details:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumped on as E, the number of berries she collected as B, and the time she took to finish the level as T. 

Then Ava jumped on E+8 enemies, collected B+3 berries, and took T+4 seconds to finish the level.

Emma's score is calculated as follows: 
E (enemies) * 10 (points per enemy) + B (berries) * 5 (points per berry) + T (seconds left) * 30 (points per second) = 10E + 5B + 30T.

Ava's score is calculated as follows: 
(E+8) * 10 + (B...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step and solve it:

Given information:
- 10 points for every enemy jumped on
- 5 points for each berry collected
- 30 points for every second left on the timer when finishing the level
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma

Step 1: Let's express Ava's score in terms of Emma's.
Ava's score = (Emma's enemies + 8) Ã— 10 ...
