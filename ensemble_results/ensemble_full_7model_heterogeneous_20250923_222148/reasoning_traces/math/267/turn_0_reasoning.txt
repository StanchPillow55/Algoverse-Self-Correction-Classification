Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - Given: It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It is stated that it takes 40% longer to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees.
   - First, we calculate 40% of the time it took to heat to 300 degrees:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 20 \text{ minutes} = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the original time of 20 minutes to find the total time to heat to 400 degrees:
     \[
     \text{Total time to heat to 400 degrees} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Time to cook the chicken:**
   - It is given that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   - The total time to warm up the oil is 28 minutes (from the previous step).
   - Therefore, the cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Cooking time} = 28 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Now we add the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees and the cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time to heat to 400 degrees} + \text{Cooking time}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 51 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is **51 minutes**.

Final answer: **51 minutes**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.
- It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.
- After warming the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken from starting to heat the oil until the chicken is cooked. We'll break this down into steps:

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees:**
   - It takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Time to heat oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes 40% longer than the time taken to heat to 300 degrees.
   - First, calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the initial heating time
* Time to heat oil to 300°: 20 minutes

2. Calculate how much longer it takes to heat from 300° to 400°
* 40% longer means: 20 × 0.40 = 8 additional minutes
* Time to heat from 300° to 400°: 8 minutes

3. Calculate total oil heating time
* Total heating time = Time to 300° + Time from 300° to 400°
* Total heating time = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

4. Calculate cooking time

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know that it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees and that it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

To find out how much longer it takes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:

0.40 * 20 minutes = 8 minutes

So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees. 

Adding this to the original 20 minutes, we find that it takes 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to heat t...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Heating oil to 300 degrees:
   - It takes 20 minutes for the oil to reach 300 degrees.

2. Heating oil from 300 to 400 degrees:
   - It takes 40% longer than the time to reach 300 degrees.
   - To calculate the time:
     * 40% of 20 minutes = 0.4 × 20 = 8 minutes
     * Total time to reach 400 degrees = 20 + 8 = 28 minutes

3. Cooking time:
   - The cooking time is 5 minutes less than the total tim...
