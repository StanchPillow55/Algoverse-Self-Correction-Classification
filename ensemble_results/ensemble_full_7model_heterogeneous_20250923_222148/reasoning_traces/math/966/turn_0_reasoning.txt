=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of brownies Greta had and how many were eaten during the party.

1. **Brownies Greta made for herself**: 
   Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies. 
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies received from the office**: 
   Greta received 1/2 dozen brownies from her office party. 
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies from her friends' surprise party**: 
   Greta's friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her. 
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total brownies before the party**: 
   Now, we will add all the brownies Greta had before the party:
   \[
   \text{Total brownies} = \text{Brownies made} + \text{Brownies from office} + \text{Brownies from friends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total brownies} = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party**: 
   During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{3}{2} \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Total brownies left after the party**: 
   We will subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies Greta had:
   \[
   \text{Brownies left} = \text{Total brownies} - \text{Brownies eaten}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Brownies left} = 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Greta has **48 individual brownies left over from the entire day**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's convert all the dozens of brownies to individual brownies. 

1 dozen is equal to 12 individual items. 

So, Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 1*12 = 12 individual brownies.

At her office, they gave her 1/2 a dozen brownies, which is 0.5*12 = 6 individual brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 4*12 = 48 individual brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 1.5*12 = 18 individual brownie...
