Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many pupils like blue.**
2. **Calculate the number of pupils remaining after accounting for those who like blue.**
3. **Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.**
4. **Calculate how many pupils like yellow.**

Let's go through each step in detail:

### Step 1: Determine how many pupils like blue.
The problem states that half of the class likes blue. Since there are 40 pupils in total:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pupils remaining after accounting for those who like blue.
After accounting for the pupils who like blue, we find the remaining pupils:

\[
\text{Remaining pupils} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.
According to the problem, one-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. We calculate this as follows:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many pupils like yellow.
Now, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We do this by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = \text{Total pupils} - (\text{Pupils who like blue} + \text{Pupils who like green})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 40 - (20 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the number of pupils who like the color yellow is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many students like the color blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of students by 2.

40 / 2 = 20 students like blue.

Next, we need to find out how many students are left who do not like blue. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who like blue from the total number of students.

40 - 20 = 20 students do not like blue.

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining...
