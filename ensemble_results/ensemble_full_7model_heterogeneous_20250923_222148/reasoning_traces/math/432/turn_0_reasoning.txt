=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of dragons slain by each prince based on the information provided.

1. **Prince Thaddeus**:
   - He slew 100 dragons.
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = 100
   \]

2. **Prince Arthur**:
   - He slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Arthur, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Dragons slain by Thaddeus} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

3. **Prince Walter**:
   - He slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Walter, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = 2 \times \text{Dragons slain by Arthur} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

4. **Prince Bruce**:
   - He slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.
   - To find the number of dragons slain by Bruce, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Dragons slain by Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dragons slain by Walter} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
   \]

Now that we have calculated the number of dragons slain by each prince, we can summarize the results:
- Prince Thaddeus: 100 dragons
- Prince Arthur: 75 dragons
- Prince Walter: 150 dragons
- Prince Bruce: 30 dragons

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Prince Bruce has slain } 30 \text{ dragons.}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of dragons each prince slew and ultimately determine how many dragons Prince Bruce slew.

1. **Prince Thaddeus:**
   - Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.

2. **Prince Arthur:**
   - Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus.
   - To find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew, we calculate:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's establish Prince Thaddeus's number as our base:
* Prince Thaddeus = 100 dragons

2. Now calculate Prince Arthur's dragons:
* Prince Arthur = ¾ × Prince Thaddeus
* Prince Arthur = ¾ × 100
* Prince Arthur = 75 dragons

3. Next calculate Prince Walter's dragons:
* Prince Walter = 2 × Prince Arthur
* Prince Walter = 2 × 75
* Prince Walter = 150 dragons

4. Finally, calculate Prince Bruce's dragons:
* Pri...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. We know that he slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus. 

So, we calculate 3/4 of 100 (the number of dragons Prince Thaddeus slew) to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. 

3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons

Next, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. We know that he slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur. 

So, we multiply the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew (75) by...
