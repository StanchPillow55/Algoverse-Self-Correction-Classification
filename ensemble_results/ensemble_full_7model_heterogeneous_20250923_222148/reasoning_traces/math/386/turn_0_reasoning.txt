=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The average is found by adding all the test scores together and then dividing by the number of tests.

Here are the test scores Wilson received:
- Test 1: 65
- Test 2: 94
- Test 3: 81
- Test 4: 86
- Test 5: 74

**Step 1: Add the test scores together.**

\[
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(65 + 94 = 159\)
2. \(159 + 81 = 240\)
3. \(240 + 86 = 326\)
4. \(326 + 74 = 400\)

So, the total sum of the test scores is:

\[
400
\]

**Step 2: Divide the total sum by the number of tests to find the average.**

Since there are 5 test scores, we divide the total sum by 5:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{400}{5}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

**Final Answer:**

Wilson's current math grade is \(80\).

Since Wilson needs a grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend, he meets the requirement with his current average of 80.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Certainly! Let's solve this math problem step by step.

Given information:
- Wilson needs to have a math grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend.
- His math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.
- The test scores he received are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of the 5 test scores.

Step 1: Add up the 5 test scores.
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his five test scores. The average is found by summing all the test scores and then dividing by the number of tests.

Here are the test scores Wilson received:
- Test 1: 65
- Test 2: 94
- Test 3: 81
- Test 4: 86
- Test 5: 74

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the test scores.**

\[
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
\]

Let's add these numbers step by step:

1. \(65 + 94 = 159\)
2. \(159 + 81 = 240\)
3. \(240 ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) To find the average (mean) of Wilson's test scores, I need to:
   * Add all the test scores together
   * Divide by the number of tests (5)

2) Adding the test scores:
   * 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
   * = 400

3) Dividing by the number of tests:
   * 400 รท 5
   * = 80

4) Reasoning:
   * The average needs to be 80 or higher for Wilson to get the car
   * His current average is exactly 80
   * This means he just bar...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

The average is calculated by adding up all the numbers and then dividing by the count of numbers. 

So, first, we add up Wilson's test scores:

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Next, we divide this sum by the count of test scores, which is 5:

400 รท 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step to find Wilson's current math grade.

Given information:
- Wilson's math grade is calculated by the average of 5 test scores.
- His test scores are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

Step 1: Calculate the sum of all test scores.
Sum of test scores = 65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
Sum of test scores = 400

Step 2: Calculate the average of the test scores by dividing the sum by the number of tests.
Average = Sum of test scores รท Num...
