=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of vehicles from the first day**: 
   - The customs officer counted 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total vehicles from first day} = \text{Number of containers} \times \text{Vehicles per container} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles on the second day**:
   - The problem states that the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.
   - We already know that there were 10 vehicles from the first day.
   - To find the number of vehicles that were brought in on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles on second day} = \text{Total vehicles} - \text{Vehicles from first day} = 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day**:
   - We know that each container contains 5 vehicles.
   - To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles brought in on the second day by the number of vehicles per container:
     \[
     \text{Number of containers on second day} = \frac{\text{Vehicles on second day}}{\text{Vehicles per container}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The number of containers that were imported on the second day is \( \boxed{4} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of vehicles from the first day**: 
   - The customs officer counted 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is calculated as follows:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of containers imported on the second day, given the information provided.

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles.
- The total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.
- All the containers contain 5 vehicles.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of vehicles on the first day.
Number of vehicles on the first day = 2 containers × 5 v...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many containers were imported on the second day, given that each container holds 5 vehicles.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles initially at the port.**

Initially, there were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles. Therefore, the total number of vehicles initially is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Initial number of vehicles} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of vehicles after the secon...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Day 1: 2 containers with 5 vehicles each
* Each container holds 5 vehicles
* Final total number of vehicles is 30

2. Calculate vehicles from Day 1:
* Vehicles on Day 1 = Number of containers × Vehicles per container
* Vehicles on Day 1 = 2 × 5 = 10 vehicles

3. To find containers from Day 2:
* First, find number of vehicles brought on Day 2
* Vehicles on Day 2 = Total vehicles - Ve...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): On the first day, there were 2 containers each containing 5 vehicles. This means there were 2*5 = 10 vehicles on the first day.

The total number of vehicles on the second day is 30. If there were already 10 vehicles from the first day, this means there were 30 - 10 = 20 new vehicles brought in on the second day.

If each container holds 5 vehicles, then the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers.

So, 4 containers were imported on the ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given:
- On the first day, 2 containers were imported, each containing 5 vehicles.
- On the second day, more containers were imported.
- After the second day, the total number of vehicles at the port was 30.
- Each container contains 5 vehicles.

Step 1: Calculate the number of vehicles imported on the first day.
Vehicles on day 1 = Number of containers × Vehicles per container
Vehicles on day 1 = 2 × 5 ...
