=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many cookies Jenny eats, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Jenny buys in a week:**
   - Jenny buys 1 bag of cookies each week, and each bag contains 36 cookies.
   \[
   \text{Total cookies in a bag} = 36
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cookies Jenny puts in her son's lunch box:**
   - Jenny puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box each day for 5 days a week.
   \[
   \text{Cookies in lunch box per week} = 4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cookies her husband eats:**
   - Her husband eats 1 cookie each day for 7 days.
   \[
   \text{Cookies eaten by husband} = 1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies consumed by her son and husband:**
   - We add the cookies consumed by her son and husband.
   \[
   \text{Total cookies consumed by son and husband} = 20 \text{ cookies} + 7 \text{ cookies} = 27 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of cookies left for Jenny:**
   - We subtract the total cookies consumed by her son and husband from the total cookies in the bag.
   \[
   \text{Cookies left for Jenny} = 36 \text{ cookies} - 27 \text{ cookies} = 9 \text{ cookies}
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of cookies that Jenny eats is:
   \[
   \boxed{9}
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* There are 36 cookies in the bag
* Son gets 4 cookies × 5 days = 20 cookies per week
* Husband eats 1 cookie × 7 days = 7 cookies per week
* Jenny eats the remaining cookies

2. Let's calculate how many cookies are eaten by son and husband:
* Son's cookies: 4 × 5 = 20 cookies
* Husband's cookies: 1 × 7 = 7 cookies
* Total eaten by son and husband: 20 + 7 = 27 cookies

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, which is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, which is 1*7 = <<1*7=7>>7 cookies.

So, Jenny's son and husband together eat 20+7 = <<20+7=27>>27 cookies.

Since the bag has 36 cookies and 27 are eaten by her son and husband, Jenny eats 36-27 = <<36-27=9>>9 cookies.

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies.

Son's cookies = 4 cookies per day × 5 days
Son's cookies = 20 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookie...
