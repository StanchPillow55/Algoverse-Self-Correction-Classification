=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower, given the information about the blue and yellow blocks.

1. **Identify the number of blue blocks**: 
   The problem states that there are 4 blue blocks.

2. **Determine the number of yellow blocks**: 
   It is stated that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Since there are 4 blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks**: 
   Now, we can find the total number of blue and yellow blocks combined:
   \[
   \text{Total blue and yellow blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of blocks in the tower**: 
   We know from the problem that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.

5. **Set up the equation to find the number of red blocks**: 
   Let \( r \) represent the number of red blocks. The total number of blocks can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   32 = 4 + 8 + r
   \]

6. **Simplify the equation**: 
   Combine the blue and yellow blocks:
   \[
   32 = 12 + r
   \]

7. **Solve for \( r \)**: 
   To isolate \( r \), subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   r = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

8. **Conclusion**: 
   The number of red blocks in the tower is \( r = 20 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The tower is made of 4 blue blocks
- There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
- There is an unknown number of red blocks
- The total number of blocks in the tower is 32

Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks.
Since there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, we can calculate the number of yellow blocks as:
Number of yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 yellow blocks

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red blocks in the tower. We are given the following information:

1. There are 4 blue blocks.
2. There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks.
3. The total number of blocks (blue, yellow, and red) is 32.
4. We need to find the number of red blocks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* There are 4 blue blocks
* There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks
* The total number of blocks is 32
* We need to find the number of red blocks

2. Calculate the number of yellow blocks:
* Yellow blocks = 2 × blue blocks
* Yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = 8 blocks

3. Find the number of red blocks:
* Total blocks = Blue blocks + Yellow blocks + Red blocks
* 32 = 4 + 8 + R...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the tower is made of 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. So, the number of yellow blocks is 2 * 4 = 8 blocks.

So far, we have 4 blue blocks + 8 yellow blocks = 12 blocks.

The total number of blocks in the tower is given as 32. If we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total, we can find the number of red blocks.

So, the number of red blocks is 32 total blocks - 12 blue and yellow blocks = 20 red block...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The tower is made of blue, yellow, and red blocks.
   * There are 4 blue blocks.
   * The number of yellow blocks is twice the number of blue blocks.
   * The total number of blocks in the tower is 32.
   * We need to find the number of red blocks.

2. Calculate the number of yellow blocks:
   * Number of yellow blocks = 2 × Number of blue blocks
   * Number of y...
