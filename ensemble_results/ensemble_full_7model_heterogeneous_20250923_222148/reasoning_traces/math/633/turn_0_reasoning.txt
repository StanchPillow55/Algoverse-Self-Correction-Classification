=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up the problem using the concept of relative speed and distance.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob's speed is 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom's speed is 70 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the relative speed:**
   Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can find the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:
   \[
   \text{Relative Speed} = \text{Tom's Speed} - \text{Bob's Speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for time:**
   To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   In this case, the distance that Tom needs to cover to catch up with Bob is 75 miles, and the speed at which he is closing the gap is 15 mph.

4. **Calculate the time:**
   Now we can substitute the values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Therefore, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Given information:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the relative speed between Bob and Tom.
Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
Relative speed = 70 miles per hour - 55 miles per hour = 15 miles per hour

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob....

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to catch up to Bob given their respective speeds and the initial distance between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Bob is initially 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.
   - We need to find out how long it will take for Tom to catch up to Bob.

2. **Relative Speed:**
   - Si...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom
- Bob's speed = 55 mph
- Tom's speed = 70 mph

Step 1: Determine the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob
* Tom is moving faster than Bob
* Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed
* Relative speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

Step 2: Use the formula: Time = Distance รท Speed
* Time = 75 miles รท 15 mph
* Time = 5 hours

Let's verify this makes sense:
* In 5 hours, T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to determine the relative speed of Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the slower speed from the faster speed. So, Tom's relative speed to Bob is 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to make up the 75-mile gap between him and Bob. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can rearrange this formula to solve for time by dividing the distance by the speed. 

So, the time it...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to calculate the time when both of them have traveled the same distance.

Given:
- Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
- Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour.
- Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.

Step 1: Let's define the variables.
Let t be the time (in hours) it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob.

Step 2: Set up the distance equations for b...
