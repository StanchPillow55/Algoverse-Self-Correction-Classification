Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the number of students needing each shirt size based on the information provided and then calculate the total number of shirts ordered.

1. **Extra-Small Shirts**: 
   - The problem states that 11 students need size extra-small.
   - Let \( E = 11 \).

2. **Small Shirts**: 
   - It is stated that twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Therefore, the number of students needing size small is:
   \[
   S = 2 \times E = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium Shirts**: 
   - The problem indicates that four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Thus, the number of students needing size medium is:
   \[
   M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large Shirts**: 
   - It is mentioned that half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Therefore, the number of students needing size large is:
   \[
   L = \frac{1}{2} \times M = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-Large Shirts**: 
   - The problem states that six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Thus, the number of students needing size extra-large is:
   \[
   XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now we have the number of students needing each shirt size:
- Extra-Small: \( E = 11 \)
- Small: \( S = 22 \)
- Medium: \( M = 18 \)
- Large: \( L = 9 \)
- Extra-Large: \( XL = 15 \)

6. **Total Number of Shirts**: 
   - To find the total number of shirts ordered, we sum the number of students needing each size:
   \[
   \text{Total} = E + S + M + L + XL
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
   \]

   Now we perform the addition step-by-step:
   \[
   11 + 22 = 33
   \]
   \[
   33 + 18 = 51
   \]
   \[
   51 + 9 = 60
   \]
   \[
   60 + 15 = 75
   \]

Therefore, the total number of shirts that Krissa ordered is \( \boxed{75} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of shirts needed for each size and then add them up to get the total number of shirts ordered.

Given information:
- 11 students need size extra-small.
- Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
- Half as many students need size large as size medium.
- Six more students need size extra-large than large.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of shirts needed for each size and then sum them up to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.

1. **Extra-Small Shirts:**
   - We are given that 11 students need size extra-small shirts.
   - Let's denote the number of extra-small shirts as \( XS = 11 \).

2. **Small Shirts:**
   - Twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is \( 2 \times X...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many extra-small shirts:
* Extra-small = 11 students

2. For small shirts, it's twice as many as extra-small:
* Small = 11 ร 2 = 22 students

3. For medium shirts, it's 4 less than small:
* Medium = 22 - 4 = 18 students

4. For large shirts, it's half as many as medium:
* Large = 18 รท 2 = 9 students

5. For extra-large shirts, it's 6 more than large:
* Extra-large = 9 + 6 = 15 students

6. N...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small.

Next, we know that twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, we multiply the number of extra-small shirts by 2 to find the number of small shirts: 11 * 2 = 22.

Then, we know that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, we subtract 4 from the number of small shirts to find the number of medium shirts: 22 - 4 = 18.

Next, we know that half as many students need size larg...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the number of students who need each size shirt and then add them all together to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order.

Given:
- 11 students need size extra-small (XS)
- Twice as many students need size small (S) as extra-small
- Four less than the number of size small students need size medium (M)
- Half as many students need size large (L) as size medium
- Six m...
