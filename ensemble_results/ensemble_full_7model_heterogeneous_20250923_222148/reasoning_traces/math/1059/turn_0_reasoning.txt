=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day**:
   Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time. Therefore, the total amount of cat food consumed by the cats in one day is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total food per day} = \text{Food per feeding} \times \text{Number of feedings per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total food per day} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last**:
   Now that we know the total food consumed per day is 120 grams, we can find out how many days 720 grams will last by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Total food per day}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

In conclusion, Imma's 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how long 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, given that she feeds them twice a day with 60 grams of cat food each time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total amount of cat food used per day:**

   Imma feeds her cats twice a day. Each feeding consists of 60 grams of cat food. Therefore, the total amount of cat food used per day is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total food p...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Imma has 3 cats
* Each cat gets fed twice per day
* Each feeding is 60 grams of cat food
* She has 720 grams of cat food total

2. Calculate how much food is needed per day:
* Number of cats = 3
* Feedings per day = 2
* Grams per feeding = 60
* Daily food needed = 3 cats × 2 feedings × 60 grams
* Daily food needed = 360 grams per day

3. Calculate how many days t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Imma feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding is 60 grams. Therefore, the total amount of food she gives her cats in a day is 3 cats * 2 times a day * 60 grams = 360 grams.

We know that Imma has 720 grams of cat food. To find out how many days this will last, we divide the total amount of food by the amount of food she uses per day. 

So, 720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days.

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 2 days.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Imma has 3 cats.
- She feeds her cats twice a day.
- Each feeding consists of 60 grams of cat food.
- She has 720 grams of cat food in total.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of cat food needed per day.
- Imma feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding is 60 grams.
- Total cat food per feeding = 60 grams × 3 cats = 180 grams
- Total cat food per day = 180 grams per feeding × 2 feed...
