Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Lylah's salary four years ago**:
   We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be denoted as \( L \).

   Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can express Adrien's salary as:
   \[
   A = L + 0.3L = 1.3L
   \]
   We are given that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   1.3L = 40000
   \]

   To find Lylah's salary \( L \), we can solve for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40000}{1.3}
   \]
   \[
   L = 30769.23 \quad (\text{approximately})
   \]

2. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago**:
   Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

3. **Calculate Adrien's salary four years later**:
   We know that Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. Therefore, his salary four years later can be calculated as:
   \[
   A_{\text{new}} = A + 0.4A = 1.4A
   \]
   Substituting Adrien's salary four years ago:
   \[
   A_{\text{new}} = 1.4 \times 40000 = 56000
   \]

4. **Calculate Lylah's salary four years later**:
   Since both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, we need to determine the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. We know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. 

   To find Lylah's salary increase, we can assume it is the same percentage increase as Adrien's, which is 40%. Thus, Lylah's salary four years later can be calculated as:
   \[
   L_{\text{new}} = L + 0.4L = 1.4L
   \]
   Substituting Lylah's salary four years ago:
   \[
   L_{\text{new}} = 1.4 \times 30769.23 \approx 43076.92
   \]

5. **Calculate the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later**:
   Now we can find the total salary of both Adrien and Lylah four years later:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} = 56000 + 43076.92
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} \approx 99076.92
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is approximately **$99,076.92**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later.
4. Add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later to get the total salary.

Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.

Adrien's salary = 1.3x (30% higher than Lylah'...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to find the salaries of Adrien and Lylah four years later, given the information about their salaries four years ago and the percentage increases.

### Step 1: Determine Adrien's Salary Four Years Ago
We are given that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.

### Step 2: Calculate Adrien's Salary Four Years Later
Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. To find his new salary:

1. Calculate 40% of Adrien's salary from four years ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's first find Lylah's salary 4 years ago:
* We know Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's
* Adrien's salary 4 years ago = $40,000
* Let's say Lylah's salary = x
* Then: x + 30% of x = $40,000
* x + 0.3x = $40,000
* 1.3x = $40,000
* x = $40,000 รท 1.3
* x = $30,769.23
* So Lylah's salary 4 years ago was $30,769.23

2. Now let's find Adrien's new salary:
* Adrien's new salary increased by 40%
* New salary =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. 

We also know that this salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary at that time. To find out Lylah's salary, we can set up the equation:

Adrien's Salary = Lylah's Salary + 0.30 * Lylah's Salary

Substituting the given value for Adrien's salary:

$40000 = Lylah's Salary + 0.30 * Lylah's Salary

This simplifies to:

$40000 = 1.30 * Lylah's Salary

Solving for Ly...
