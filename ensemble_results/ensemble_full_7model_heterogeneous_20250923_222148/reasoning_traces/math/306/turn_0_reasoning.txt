=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of loaves produced each day**:  
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning**:  
   According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning.  
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60
   \]
   Calculating this:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

3. **Determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales**:  
   We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced:
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**:  
   The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. First, we find half of the remaining loaves:
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]
   This means 10 loaves are sold in total during the afternoon and evening.

5. **Determine the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**:  
   Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are sold equally, we divide the 10 loaves by 2:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

Thus, the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \( \boxed{5} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total loaves produced = 60
* Two-thirds sold in morning
* Half of remaining sold equally between afternoon and evening

2. Calculate loaves sold in morning:
* Two-thirds of 60
* 60 × (2/3) = 40 loaves sold in morning

3. Calculate loaves remaining after morning:
* Total - Morning sales = Remaining
* 60 - 40 = 20 loaves remaining

4. Calculate loaves sold in afternoon a...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. 

Step 1: Find out how many loaves are sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, we calculate 2/3 of 60.
(2/3) * 60 = 40 loaves

Step 2: Find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.
We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves.
60 - 40 = 20 loaves

Step 3: Find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.
Half of what is left is sold eq...
