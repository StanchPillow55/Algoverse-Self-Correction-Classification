=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of people that entered The Best Cookeries Around restaurant on that day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Group of People**:
   - In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.
   - So, we have:
     \[
     \text{Initial group} = 50
     \]

2. **People Entering at 10:00**:
   - At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.
   - Therefore, we add this to our total:
     \[
     \text{Total after 10:00} = 50 + 40 = 90
     \]

3. **Twice the Number of People from 10:00**:
   - The problem states that twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 (which is 40) came in and ordered lunch.
   - So, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Twice the number from 10:00} = 2 \times 40 = 80
     \]
   - Now we add this to our total:
     \[
     \text{Total after lunch} = 90 + 80 = 170
     \]

4. **Additional Group of People**:
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the initial group (which was 50) entered the restaurant.
   - We calculate:
     \[
     \text{Three times the initial group} = 3 \times 50 = 150
     \]
   - Finally, we add this to our total:
     \[
     \text{Final total} = 170 + 150 = 320
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is:
     \[
     \boxed{320}
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First group (morning):
* 50 people entered

2. Second group (10:00):
* 40 people entered

3. Third group (lunch):
* This is twice the number of people who entered at 10:00
* Second group was 40 people
* So: 40 × 2 = 80 people entered

4. Fourth group (evening):
* This is 3 times the number of people who came in first
* First group was 50 people
* So: 50 × 3 = 150 people entered

5. Total number of people:
* Add a...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.

2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. This makes a total of 50 + 40 = 90 people so far.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in. This means 2 * 40 = 80 people came in. Adding this to our total, we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.
