=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the number of books each person has using variables and then use the information given to find the answer step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books Steven has.
   - According to the problem, Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can express Alice's books as:
     \[
     A = S + 6
     \]
   - Clara has two times as many books as Steven, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     C = 2S
     \]

2. **Use the Information Given**:
   - We know that Clara has 20 books:
     \[
     C = 20
     \]
   - Since we have \( C = 2S \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2S = 20
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - To find \( S \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Books for Alice**:
   - Now that we know \( S \), we can find the number of books Alice has using the equation \( A = S + 6 \):
     \[
     A = 10 + 6 = 16
     \]

5. **Calculate the Difference in the Number of Books**:
   - We need to find how many more books Clara has than Alice. We can calculate this as:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = C - A = 20 - 16 = 4
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Clara has 4 more books than Alice.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define the number of books each person has using variables and then use the information given to find the answer step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books Steven has.
   - According to the problem, Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so we can express Alice's books as:
     \[
     A = S + 6

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
- Clara has 20 books.

Step 1: Find the number of books Steven has.
Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven, and Clara has 20 books, we can find the number of books Steven has.
Clara's books = 2 × Steven's books
20 = 2 × Steven's books
Steven's books = 20 / 2 = 10 books

Step 2: Find the number of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books each person has and then find the difference between the number of books Clara has and the number of books Alice has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Steven has.
- According to the problem, Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Clara has \( 2S \) books.
- We are given that Clara has 20 books, so we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2S = 20
  \]

**Step 1: Solve for...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let me identify what we know:
* Clara has 20 books
* Clara has two times as many books as Steven
* Alice has 6 more books than Steven

2. Let's find how many books Steven has:
* Clara has two times Steven's books = 20 books
* So, Steven's books = 20 ÷ 2
* Steven has 10 books

3. Now let's find Alice's books:
* Alice has 6 more books than Steven
* Alice's books = Steven's books + 6
* Alice's books = 10 + 6
...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of books Steven has as S, the number of books Alice has as A, and the number of books Clara has as C.

From the problem, we know that:

1) Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so A = S + 6.
2) Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so C = 2S.
3) Clara has 20 books, so C = 20.

We can substitute the value of C from the third equation into the second equation to find the number of books Steven has:

20 = 2S
S = 20 / 2
S = 10

Now that we know St...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find out how many books Steven and Alice have, and then calculate the difference between Clara's and Alice's books.

Given:
- Alice has 6 more books than Steven.
- Clara has two times as many books as Steven.
- Clara has 20 books.

Step 1: Determine the number of books Steven has.
Clara's books = 2 × Steven's books
20 = 2 × Steven's books
Steven's books = 20 ÷ 2 = 10

So...
