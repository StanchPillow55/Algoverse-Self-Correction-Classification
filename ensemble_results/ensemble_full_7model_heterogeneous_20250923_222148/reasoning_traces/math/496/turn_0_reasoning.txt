=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Angela's current age based on the information given about Brett's age and the future age relationship between them.

1. **Identify Brett's current age**: 
   - Brett is currently 14 years old.

2. **Determine Brett's age in four years**:
   - In four years, Brett will be:
     \[
     14 + 4 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Understand the relationship between Angela's age and Brett's current age**:
   - The problem states that in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is currently 14 years old, we can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Angela's age in four years} = 3 \times \text{Brett's current age} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Angela's current age**:
   - If Angela will be 42 years old in four years, we can find her current age by subtracting 4 years from her age in four years:
     \[
     \text{Angela's current age} = 42 - 4 = 38 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Angela is currently **38 years old**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{38}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brett is 14 years old.
- In four years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now.

Step 1: Find Brett's age in four years.
Brett's age in four years = 14 + 4 = 18 years old

Step 2: Find Angela's age in four years.
Angela's age in four years = 3 × Brett's current age
Angela's age in four years = 3 × 14 = 42 years old

Step 3: Find Angela's current age.
Angela's current age = A...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Brett is 14 years old now
* We need to find Angela's age now
* In 4 years, Angela will be three times Brett's current age

2. Let's find what three times Brett's current age is:
* Brett's current age = 14
* Three times Brett's current age = 14 × 3 = 42

3. Now we know that in 4 years, Angela will be 42 years old
* Angela's age in 4 years = 42

4. To find Angela's curre...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how old Angela will be in four years. Since Brett is currently 14, and Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now in four years, we can calculate Angela's age in four years by multiplying Brett's current age by 3.

14 years * 3 = 42 years

So, Angela will be 42 years old in four years.

Next, to find out how old Angela is now, we need to subtract the four years from the future age we just calculated. This is because the problem states t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brett is currently 14 years old.
   * In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now.

2. Calculate Brett's age in four years:
   * Brett's age in 4 years = Current age + 4
   * Brett's age in 4 years = 14 + 4 = 18 years old

3. Use the information about Angela's age in four years:
   * Angela's age in 4 years = 3 × Brett's current age
   * Ange...
