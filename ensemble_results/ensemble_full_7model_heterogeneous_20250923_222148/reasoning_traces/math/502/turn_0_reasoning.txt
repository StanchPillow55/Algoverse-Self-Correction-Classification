=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of gifts needed for each group of friends:**
   - Cherrie has 5 friends.
   - 2 of her friends want 5 gifts each.
   - The other 3 friends want 2 gifts each.

2. **Calculate the total gifts for the first group (2 friends wanting 5 gifts each):**
   \[
   \text{Total gifts for 2 friends} = 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts/friend} = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total gifts for the second group (3 friends wanting 2 gifts each):**
   \[
   \text{Total gifts for 3 friends} = 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts/friend} = 6 \text{ gifts}
   \]

4. **Add the gifts from both groups to find the total gifts needed for her friends:**
   \[
   \text{Total gifts for friends} = 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
   \]

5. **Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts:**
   \[
   \text{Additional random gifts} = 10 \text{ gifts}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of gifts Cherrie bought:**
   \[
   \text{Total gifts bought} = \text{Total gifts for friends} + \text{Additional random gifts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total gifts bought} = 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
   \]

Thus, the total number of gifts that Cherrie bought is \( \boxed{26} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate gifts for friends who want 5 gifts each
* 2 friends × 5 gifts = 10 gifts

2. Next, calculate gifts for friends who want 2 gifts each
* 3 friends × 2 gifts = 6 gifts

3. Add the random extra gifts Cherrie bought
* Extra random gifts = 10 gifts

4. Now add all gifts together
* Total gifts = Gifts for first group + Gifts for second group + Random gifts
* Total gifts = 10 + 6 + 10 = 26 gifts

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Cherrie's 2 friends want 5 gifts each. So, for these 2 friends, Cherrie will buy 2 friends * 5 gifts = <<2*5=10>>10 gifts.

Her other 3 friends want 2 gifts each. So, for these 3 friends, Cherrie will buy 3 friends * 2 gifts = <<3*2=6>>6 gifts.

So far, Cherrie has bought 10 gifts + 6 gifts = <<10+6=16>>16 gifts.

Cherrie then decides to buy 10 more random gifts. So, in total, Cherrie has bought 16 gifts + 10 gifts = <<16+10=26>>26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26...
