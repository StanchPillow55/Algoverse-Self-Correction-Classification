=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow the steps of calculating the number of people on the train after each stop.

1. **Initial number of people on the train**: 
   The train starts with 172 people.

2. **First stop**:
   - At the first stop, 47 people get off the train. 
   - We subtract the number of people getting off from the initial number:
     \[
     172 - 47 = 125
     \]
   - After 47 people get off, there are 125 people left on the train.

   - Next, 13 more people get on the train.
   - We add the number of people getting on to the current number:
     \[
     125 + 13 = 138
     \]
   - After the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

3. **Second stop**:
   - At the next stop, 38 people get off the train.
   - We subtract the number of people getting off from the current number:
     \[
     138 - 38 = 100
     \]
   - After 38 people get off, there are 100 people left on the train.

Now, we have completed all the calculations for both stops.

**Final answer**: The number of people on the train after all stops is **100**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The train initially has 172 people traveling on it.
- At the first stop, 47 people get off and 13 more people get on.
- At the next stop, another 38 people get off.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the train after the first stop.
Initial number of people on the train = 172
Number of people who get off at the first stop = 47
Number of people who get on at the first stop = 13
Number of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many people are on the train after the given stops, we need to carefully track the number of people getting on and off the train at each stop. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of People on the Train:**
   - The train starts with 172 people.

2. **First Stop:**
   - At the first stop, 47 people get off the train.
   - To find out how many people remain on the train after these people get off, we subtra...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of people on train = 172 people

2. At first stop:
* 47 people get off: 172 - 47 = 125 people
* 13 people get on: 125 + 13 = 138 people

3. At second stop:
* 38 people get off: 138 - 38 = 100 people

Reasoning:
* Started with 172 people
* First stop had a net loss of 34 people (47 off - 13 on)
* Second stop had 38 people get off
* Each step reduced the total number of passengers

Final Answer: 100 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The train starts with 172 people on it. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. 

172 - 47 = 125

Then, 13 people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125.

125 + 13 = 138

At the next stop, 38 people get off the train, so we subtract 38 from 138.

138 - 38 = 100

So, there are 100 people left on the train. 

Therefore, the final answer is 100 people.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of people on the train and then account for the changes at each stop.

Given:
- Initially, there are 172 people on the train.
- At the first stop, 47 people get off, and 13 people get on.
- At the next stop, another 38 people get off.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the train after the first stop.
People getting off at the first stop = 47
People getting on at...
