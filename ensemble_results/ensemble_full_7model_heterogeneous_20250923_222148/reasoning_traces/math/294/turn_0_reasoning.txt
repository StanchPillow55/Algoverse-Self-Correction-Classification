=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the ages of the sons**:
   - The oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest. Therefore, the youngest son is:
     \[
     \text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges washed**:
   - The oldest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which means he washes 8 oranges.
   - The youngest son washes as many oranges as he is years old, which means he washes 4 oranges.
   - Now, we add the number of oranges washed by both sons:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges washed} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of unwashed oranges**:
   - Will initially bought 15 oranges. To find out how many are left unwashed, we subtract the number of washed oranges from the total number of oranges:
     \[
     \text{Unwashed oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total oranges washed} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The number of oranges left unwashed is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of oranges washed by the two sons and then subtract it from the total number of oranges to find the number of oranges left unwashed.

Given information:
- Will buys 15 oranges.
- The oldest son is 8 years old.
- The youngest son is half as old as the oldest, which means he is 4 years old.

Step 1: Find the number of oranges washed by the oldest son.
Oldest son's age = 8 years
Number of oranges washed b...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges Will's sons wash and then subtract that number from the total number of oranges to find out how many are left unwashed.

1. **Determine the age of the youngest son:**
   - We know the oldest son is 8 years old.
   - The youngest son is half as old as the oldest son.
   - Therefore, the age of the youngest son is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) years old.

2. **Calculate the number of oranges each son washes:**
   - The o...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Will bought 15 oranges
* He has 2 sons
* Oldest son is 8 years old
* Youngest son is half as old as oldest son

2. Calculate the youngest son's age:
* Youngest son = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 years old

3. Calculate how many oranges each son will wash:
* Oldest son will wash 8 oranges (because he's 8 years old)
* Youngest son will wash 4 oranges (because he's 4 years old)

4. Calculat...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how old the youngest son is. Since he is half as old as the oldest son, who is 8 years old, we divide 8 by 2. 

8 ÷ 2 = 4

So, the youngest son is 4 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges the two sons washed in total. Since they each wash as many oranges as they are years old, the oldest son washed 8 oranges and the youngest son washed 4 oranges.

8 + 4 = 12

So, the two sons washed 12 oranges in total.

Finally, we need to find ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Will buys 15 oranges.
   * He has 2 sons.
   * The oldest son is 8 years old.
   * The youngest son is half as old as the oldest.
   * Each son washes as many oranges as their age.

2. Calculate the age of the youngest son:
   * Youngest son's age = 1/2 × Oldest son's age
   * Youngest son's age = 1/2 × 8
   * Youngest son's age = 4 years old

3. Calculate the to...
