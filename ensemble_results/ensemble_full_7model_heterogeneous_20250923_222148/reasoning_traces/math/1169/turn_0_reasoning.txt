=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the amounts given to Ronnie and Rissa**:
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. Therefore, Rissa's amount is:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much money Rissa has left after giving some to her sister**:
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her original amount. 
   - Rissa's original amount is $15, so the amount she has left is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate how much Rissa gave to her little sister**:
   - To find out how much Rissa gave to her little sister, we subtract the amount she has left from her original amount:
     \[
     15 - 12 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their little sister, Ronnie also gave $3**:
   - Therefore, Ronnie's new amount after giving $3 to his little sister is:
     \[
     5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     \boxed{2}
     \] 

Thus, Ronnie has $2 left after giving money to their little sister.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Ronnie has left after both he and Rissa give an equal amount of money to their little sister.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amounts:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. Therefore, Rissa was given \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars.

2. **After Giving Money to Their Little Sister:**
   - Let \(x\) be the amount of money both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Ronnie was given $5
* Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie
* They each gave the same amount to their sister
* Rissa has 4/5 of her original money left

2. Calculate Rissa's initial amount:
* Rissa's money = 3 × Ronnie's money
* Rissa's money = 3 × $5 = $15

3. Find out how much money Rissa has left:
* Rissa has 4/5 of $15 left
* 4/5 × $15 = $12
* So Rissa has $12 left

4. Calcu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine how much money Rissa was given.
Since Rissa was given thrice as much money as Ronnie, and Ronnie was given $5, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Step 2: Determine how much money Rissa gave to their little sister.
Since Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money after giving some to their little sister, this means she gave away 1/5 of her money. So, Rissa gave 1/5 * $15 = $3 to their little sister.

Step 3: Determine how much...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how much money Ronnie has left, we first need to calculate the amount of money Rissa had initially and the amount both Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.

Given:
- Ronnie was given $5.
- Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie.
- After giving an equal amount to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Rissa had initially.
