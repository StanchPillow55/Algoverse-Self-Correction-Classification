=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Theo can spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we need to break down his expenses step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of business suits} = 6 \times 100 = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of suitcases} = 3 \times 50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit. The cost of one business suit is $100, so:
   \[
   5 \times 100 = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of flight ticket} = 500 + 700 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate total expenses:**
   - Now we sum up all the expenses:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of business suits} + \text{Cost of suitcases} + \text{Cost of flight ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the amount Theo wishes to save:**
   - Theo wants to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo will have after expenses and savings:**
   - Theo starts with $6000. After accounting for his total expenses and the amount he wishes to save, we can find out how much he has left for gifts:
   \[
   \text{Amount left for gifts} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Total expenses} - \text{Amount saved}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left for gifts} = 6000 - 1950 - 2000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left for gifts} = 6000 - 3950 = 2050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa is:

\[
\boxed{2050 \text{ dollars}}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of business suits

2. Next, calculate the cost of suitcases
* Cost of one suitcase = $50
* Cost of 3 suitcases = $50 × 3 = $150

3. Calculate the flight ticket cost
