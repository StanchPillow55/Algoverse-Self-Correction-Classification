Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of cards of each color: red, green, and yellow.

1. **Identify the number of red cards:**
   We are given that there are 15 red cards.

   \[
   \text{Red cards} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of green cards:**
   We are told that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find the number of green cards, we first calculate 60% of the number of red cards.

   \[
   60\% \text{ of red cards} = 0.60 \times 15 = 9
   \]

   Now, we add this to the number of red cards to find the total number of green cards.

   \[
   \text{Green cards} = \text{Red cards} + 60\% \text{ of red cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of yellow cards:**
   We are told that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. We first find the sum of the red and green cards.

   \[
   \text{Total red and green cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
   \]

   Therefore, the number of yellow cards is:

   \[
   \text{Yellow cards} = 39
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cards:**
   Now, we can find the total number of cards by adding the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Red cards} + \text{Green cards} + \text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 + 39
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   15 + 24 = 39
   \]
   \[
   39 + 39 = 78
   \]

Thus, the total number of cards of all mentioned colors is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red, green, and yellow cards in the set, and then find the total number of cards.

### Step 1: Determine the number of green cards.

We are given that there are 15 red cards. The problem states that there are 60% more green cards than red cards.

First, calculate 60% of the number of red cards:
\[ 60\% \text{ of 15} = 0.60 \times 15 = 9. \]

Since there are 60% more green cards than red cards, we add this to the n...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* There are 15 red cards
* Green cards are 60% more than red cards
* Yellow cards equal the sum of red and green cards

2. Let's find the number of green cards:
* 60% more means multiply by 1.60
* Green cards = 15 × 1.60
* Green cards = 24 cards

3. Now let's find the sum of red and green cards:
* Red + Green = 15 + 24
* Red + Green = 39 cards

4. Yellow cards equal the sum of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many green cards there are. We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 

To find out the number of green cards, we calculate 60% of the number of red cards, which is 15. 

60/100 * 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. 

Adding these 9 cards to the original 15 red cards, we find that there are 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 15 red cards.
   * The number of green cards is 60% more than the red cards.
   * The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards.

2. Calculate the number of green cards:
   * 60% of 15 = 0.6 × 15 = 9
   * Number of green cards = 15 + 9 = 24
