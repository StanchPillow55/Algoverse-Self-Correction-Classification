Final Answer: To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his drinking habits for both weekdays and weekends.

1. **Identify John's drinking habits on weekdays:**
   - John drinks a glass of water with breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
   - He also drinks one glass of water before going to bed.
   - Therefore, the total number of glasses of water he drinks in one day during the weekdays is:
     \[
     \text{Glasses of water per day} = \text{Breakfast} + \text{Lunch} + \text{Dinner} + \text{Before bed}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Glasses of water per day} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the total glasses of water for weekdays:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekdays is:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses on weekdays} = \text{Glasses per day} \times \text{Number of weekdays}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total glasses on weekdays} = 4 \times 5 = 20
     \]

3. **Identify John's drinking habits on weekends:**
   - On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John drinks a glass of water with breakfast and lunch, but he has a soda with dinner.
   - He still drinks one glass of water before going to bed.
   - Therefore, the total number of glasses of water he drinks in one day during the weekends is:
     \[
     \text{Glasses of water per day (weekend)} = \text{Breakfast} + \text{Lunch} + \text{Before bed}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Glasses of water per day (weekend)} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculate the total glasses of water for weekends:**
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks during the weekends is:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses on weekends} = \text{Glasses per day (weekend)} \times \text{Number of weekend days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total glasses on weekends} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

5. **Calculate the total glasses of water in a week:**
   - Now, we add the total glasses of water from weekdays and weekends:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses in a week} = \text{Total glasses on weekdays} + \text{Total glasses on weekends}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total glasses in a week} = 20 + 6 = 26
     \]

Thus, the total number of glasses of water John drinks in a week is \( \boxed{26} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's count weekday water consumption:
* Weekdays = Monday through Friday (5 days)
* Each weekday he drinks:
  * Breakfast: 1 glass
  * Lunch: 1 glass
  * Dinner: 1 glass
  * Bedtime: 1 glass
* Total per weekday = 4 glasses
* Total for all weekdays = 4 glasses Ã— 5 days = 20 glasses

2. Now let's count weekend water consumption:
* Weekends = Saturday and Sunday (2 days)
* Each weekend day he drinks:
  * Bre...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): John drinks 4 glasses of water every weekday and 3 glasses of water every weekend day.

There are 5 weekdays in a week and 2 weekend days in a week.

So, during the weekdays, John drinks 4 glasses of water/day * 5 days/week = 20 glasses of water/week.

During the weekends, John drinks 3 glasses of water/day * 2 days/week = 6 glasses of water/week.

Adding these together, John drinks 20 glasses of water/week + 6 glasses of water/week = 26 glasses of water in a week.

So, J...
