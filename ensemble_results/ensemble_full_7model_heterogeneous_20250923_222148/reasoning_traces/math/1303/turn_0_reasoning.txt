=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation.**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = holes per day × number of days
   \[
   \text{Total holes dug} = 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the rate at which Nate fills in the holes while the dog continues to dig.**
   - Nate fills in 9 holes per day.
   - The dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night.
   - Therefore, the net change in the number of holes per day is:
   \[
   \text{Net change} = \text{holes filled by Nate} - \text{holes dug by the dog}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net change} = 9 \text{ holes/day} - 6 \text{ holes/day} = 3 \text{ holes/day}
   \]
   This means that each day, Nate effectively reduces the total number of holes by 3.

3. **Calculate how many days it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.**
   - Initially, there are 84 holes to fill.
   - Since Nate fills in 3 holes per day, we can find the number of days required to fill in all the holes:
   \[
   \text{Days required} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net change per day}} = \frac{84 \text{ holes}}{3 \text{ holes/day}} = 28 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert the number of days into weeks.**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we convert days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Weeks required} = \frac{\text{Days required}}{7} = \frac{28 \text{ days}}{7} = 4 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, it takes Nate **4 weeks** to fill in all the holes.

**Final Answer: 4 weeks**

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation.**
   - The dog digs 6 holes per day.
   - Nate is on vacation for 14 days.
   - Total holes dug = holes per day × number of days
   \[
   \text{Total holes dug} = 6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation, and then calculate how long it will take Nate to fill in all the holes.

Given information:
- Nate's dog can dig 6 holes a day.
- The dog digs for 14 days while Nate is on vacation.
- When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day.
- The dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog d...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weeks it will take Nate to fill in all the holes dug by his dog. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Holes Dug

Nate's dog digs 6 holes per day. Nate is on vacation for 14 days. Therefore, the total number of holes dug by the dog during Nate's vacation is:

\[
6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Daily Net Change in...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many holes the dog dug during the 14 days of vacation:
* 6 holes per day × 14 days = 84 holes total

2. Now, each day after Nate returns:
* Nate fills in 9 holes
* Dog digs 6 new holes
* Net reduction = 9 - 6 = 3 holes per day

3. To find how many days it takes to fill all holes:
* Starting holes = 84
* Net reduction = 3 holes per day
* Days needed = 84 ÷ 3 = 28 days

4. Convert days to week...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down into steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation.
The dog can dig 6 holes a day and Nate is gone for 14 days. So, the dog digs 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes while Nate is on vacation.

Step 2: Calculate the net number of holes filled by Nate each day after he gets back.
When Nate gets back, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, each day, Nat...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Calculate the total number of holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation:
   * The dog digs 6 holes per day for 14 days.
   * Total holes dug = 6 holes/day × 14 days = 84 holes

2. Determine the net number of holes filled per day:
   * Nate fills 9 holes per day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night.
   * Net holes filled per day = 9 holes filled - 6 holes dug = 3 holes

3. Calculate the number ...
