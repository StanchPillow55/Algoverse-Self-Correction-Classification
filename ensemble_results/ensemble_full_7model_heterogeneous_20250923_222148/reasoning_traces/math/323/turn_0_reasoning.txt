=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream.

### Step 1: Determine the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve a cooling of 65 degrees, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees per ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weakening effect of the ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the 5 ice cubes is:

\[
\text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters per ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weakening effect of the cream.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, we need to account for this additional weakening:

\[
\text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 4: Combine the weakening effects.

Now, we can find the total weakening of the iced coffee by adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[
\text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Shannon's iced coffee is **75 milliliters weaker** after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream. 

\[
\boxed{75}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes when it is cooled by 65 degrees using ice cubes and when she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:**

   Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. Therefore, to find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve a 65-degree reduction, we divide 65 by 13:

   \[
   ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many ice cubes are needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees
   * Each ice cube cools by 13 degrees
   * Number of ice cubes = 65 รท 13 = 5 ice cubes

2. Calculate how much the ice cubes weaken the coffee
   * Each ice cube weakens by 12 milliliters
   * Total weakening from ice cubes = 5 ice cubes ร 12 milliliters
   * Total weakening from ice cubes = 60 milliliters

3. Add the weakening effec...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many ice cubes Shannon used to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes. 

65 รท 13 = 5 ice cubes

Next, we need to determine how much weaker the coffee became due to the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12.

5 ice cubes * 12 milliliters/ice cube = 60 milliliters

Finally, w...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees.
   * Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.
   * Shannon wants to cool her coffee by 65 degrees.
   * Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream.

2. Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees:
   * Cooling required = 65 degrees
   * Cooling per ice cube = 13 degrees
   * Number of ic...
