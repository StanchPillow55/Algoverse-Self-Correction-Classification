=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break down the total hours of TV Frankie watched each day and then determine how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

1. **Calculate TV time for each day:**
   - **Monday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Tuesday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Wednesday:** Watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Let’s denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \( x \). Since each episode is 0.5 hours, the total time for Wednesday is \( 0.5x \) hours.
   - **Thursday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour) and 0.5 hours (1 episode of 30 minutes). Total for Thursday is \( 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \) hours.
   - **Friday:** Watched 2 hours (2 episodes of 1 hour). 

2. **Sum up the total hours watched:**
   - Total hours from Monday: 1 hour
   - Total hours from Tuesday: 1 hour
   - Total hours from Wednesday: \( 0.5x \) hours
   - Total hours from Thursday: 1.5 hours
   - Total hours from Friday: 2 hours

   Now we can express the total hours watched as:
   \[
   1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2
   \]

3. **Combine the constants:**
   \[
   1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5
   \]
   So, the total hours watched can be rewritten as:
   \[
   5.5 + 0.5x
   \]

4. **Set up the equation for total hours:**
   We know that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5.5 + 0.5x = 7
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
   \[
   0.5x = 7 - 5.5
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 1.5
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 0.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Frankie watched **3 episodes** of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's list out how much TV Frankie watched each day:
   * Monday: 1 hour
   * Tuesday: 1 hour
   * Wednesday: x number of 30-minute episodes
   * Thursday: 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours
   * Friday: 2 hours

2. Let's add up all the known hours:
   * Monday + Tuesday + Thursday + Friday
   * 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours

3. We know the total is 7 hours
   * So Wednesday's viewing time = 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem day by day:

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched a 1-hour episode each night. So, he watched 1 hour * 2 days = 2 hours of TV.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. So, he watched 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours of TV.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes. So, he watched 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours of TV.

So, from Monday to Friday, excluding Wednesday, Frankie watched 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday...
