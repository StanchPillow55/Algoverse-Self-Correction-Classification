=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of the 5 phones and then calculate how much change the seller will give back after receiving $4000.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the phones

The seller bought 5 phones, and each phone costs $700. We can find the total cost by multiplying the number of phones by the cost per phone:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Phones} \times \text{Cost per Phone}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 700
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3500
\]

### Step 2: Determine the amount of money given to the seller

The seller gives the seller $4000 in dollar bills. 

### Step 3: Calculate the change to be given back

To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount Given} - \text{Total Cost}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Change} = 4000 - 3500
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Change} = 500
\]

### Final Answer

The seller will give back **$500** in change.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The electronics seller bought 5 phones for $700 each.
- The seller gave the buyer $4000 in dollar bills.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 5 phones.
Total cost of the phones = 5 phones × $700 per phone = $3,500

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much change the seller should give back after the purchase of 5 phones.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the phones.**

The seller bought 5 phones, each costing $700. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of phones by the cost per phone:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total cost of the phones
* Cost per phone = $700
* Number of phones = 5
* Total cost = $700 × 5 = $3,500

2. Now, let's find the change
* Amount given = $4,000
* Total cost = $3,500
* Change = Amount given - Total cost
* Change = $4,000 - $3,500 = $500

Reasoning:
* The seller needs to pay for 5 phones at $700 each, totaling $3,500
* They gave $4,000 in cash
* Therefore, they should rec...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the 5 phones. 

The cost of one phone is $700. So, the total cost of 5 phones would be 5 * $700 = $3500.

The electronics seller gave the seller $4000. 

To find out how much change the seller will give back, we subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given by the electronics seller. 

So, $4000 - $3500 = $500.

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change.
