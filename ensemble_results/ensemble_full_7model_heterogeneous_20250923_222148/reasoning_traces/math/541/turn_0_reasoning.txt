=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves daily in the first half of April and how much he needs to save daily in the second half to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.

### Step 1: Determine the number of days in April
April has 30 days.

### Step 2: Identify the first and second halves of the month
- The first half of April consists of the first 15 days.
- The second half of April consists of the last 15 days.

### Step 3: Define variables for daily savings
Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month.

### Step 4: Calculate total savings for the first half
In the first half (15 days), the total savings will be:
\[
\text{Total savings in first half} = 15x
\]

### Step 5: Define savings for the second half
According to the problem, Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half. Therefore, the daily savings in the second half will be:
\[
\text{Daily savings in second half} = 2x
\]

### Step 6: Calculate total savings for the second half
In the second half (15 days), the total savings will be:
\[
\text{Total savings in second half} = 15 \times (2x) = 30x
\]

### Step 7: Set up the equation for total savings
The total savings for the entire month must equal his target of $1125. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
15x + 30x = 1125
\]

### Step 8: Combine like terms
\[
45x = 1125
\]

### Step 9: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), divide both sides by 45:
\[
x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
\]

### Step 10: Calculate daily savings for the second half
Now that we have \( x \), we can find the daily savings for the second half:
\[
\text{Daily savings in second half} = 2x = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

### Final Answer
Elvis needs to save **$50** each day in the second half of the month to meet his savings target of $1125.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Elvis should save each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125, given that he saves twice as much daily in the second half as he does in the first half.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Month's Structure:**
   - April has 30 days.
   - The first half of April consists of the first 15 days (April 1 to April 15).
   - The second half of April consists of the last 15 days...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify the key information:
   * Monthly target = $1125
   * April has 30 days
   * First 15 days: x dollars per day
   * Last 15 days: 2x dollars per day (twice as much)

2) Let's set up an equation:
   * First 15 days total = 15x
   * Last 15 days total = 15(2x) = 30x
   * Total savings = Monthly target
   * 15x + 30x = 1125

3) Simplify the equation:
   * 45x = 1125

4) Solve for x:
   * x = 112...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is 15 days and the second half of the month is also 15 days.

Let's say Elvis saves x dollars each day in the first half of the month. Then, he will save 2x dollars each day in the second half of the month.

The total amount of money saved in the month is the sum of the money saved in the first half and the second half. So, we can write the equation:

15x (first half) + 15*2x (second half) = $1125 (total monthly saving tar...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125.
   * In April, he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
   * We need to find out how much he has to save each day in the second half of the month.

2. Determine the number of days in April:
   * April has 30 days.

3. Split the month into two equal halves:
   * First half: 1...
