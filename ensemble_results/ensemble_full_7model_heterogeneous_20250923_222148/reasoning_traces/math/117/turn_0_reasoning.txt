=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much John paid for the shoes, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the number of pairs of shoes John bought**:
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total pairs of shoes} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Pairs per child} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pairs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes**:
   - Each pair of shoes costs $60.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total pairs of shoes} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 6 \times 60
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - Now we calculate \(6 \times 60\):
     \[
     6 \times 60 = 360
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the total amount John paid for the shoes is $360.

Final answer:
\[
\text{John paid } \$360.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children.
- The cost of each pair of shoes is $60.

To find the total amount John paid, we need to calculate the total number of pairs of shoes he bought and then multiply it by the cost per pair.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes John bought.
Number of children × Number of pairs of shoes per child = Total number of ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost John paid for the shoes. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pairs of shoes John buys:**
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys is calculated by multiplying the number of children by the number of pairs per child:

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* John has 3 children
* He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child
* Each pair costs $60

2. Calculate total number of pairs of shoes:
* Number of pairs per child = 2
* Number of children = 3
* Total pairs = 2 × 3 = 6 pairs of shoes

3. Calculate total cost:
* Cost per pair = $60
* Total pairs = 6
* Total cost = $60 × 6 = $360

Reasoning: Since John bought 2 pairs for each ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. Since he bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, we multiply 2 by 3. 

2 pairs/child * 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes

Next, we need to find out how much all these shoes cost. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we multiply the total number of pairs by the cost per pair.

6 pairs * $60/pair = $360

So, John paid $360 for the shoes.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John has 3 children.
   * He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.
   * Each pair of shoes costs $60.

2. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes John buys:
   * Number of children = 3
   * Pairs of shoes per child = 2
   * Total pairs of shoes = Number of children × Pairs of shoes per child
   * Total pairs of shoes = 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of shoes

3. Calculate the to...
