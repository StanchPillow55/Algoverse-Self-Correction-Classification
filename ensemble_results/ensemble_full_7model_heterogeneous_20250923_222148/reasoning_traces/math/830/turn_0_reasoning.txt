=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we will break down her activities into three parts: the time spent filming TikTok videos, the time spent writing songs, and the time spent doing makeup. We will then sum these times to get the total time spent on TikTok in a month.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent filming TikTok videos

Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on videos per week:**
   \[
   \text{Time per week} = \text{Number of videos} \times \text{Time per video}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time per week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on videos in a month (4 weeks):**
   \[
   \text{Time per month} = \text{Time per week} \times 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time per month} = 72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent writing songs

Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs.

1. **Convert hours to minutes:**
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent writing songs in a month (4 weeks):**
   \[
   \text{Time per month} = 120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent doing makeup

Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.

1. **Calculate the total time spent on makeup per week:**
   \[
   \text{Time per week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on makeup in a month (4 weeks):**
   \[
   \text{Time per month} = 90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent on TikTok in a month

Now we will sum the time spent on videos, writing songs, and doing makeup.

1. **Total time spent on TikTok:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time on videos} + \text{Time on songs} + \text{Time on makeup}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 288 \text{ minutes} + 480 \text{ minutes} + 360 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Final Answer

Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.
