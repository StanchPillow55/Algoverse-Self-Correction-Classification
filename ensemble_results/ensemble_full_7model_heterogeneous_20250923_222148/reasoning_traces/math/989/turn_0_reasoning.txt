=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break the problem down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it will take her to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it will take her to cook 90 shrimp, we first need to determine the cooking rate:

\[
\text{Cooking rate} = \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ shrimp/minute}
\]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp using the same formula:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp cooked per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp

Now, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp is **45 minutes**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Given information:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.
- Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- Emily needs to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to sauté 90 shrimp.
Time to sauté 90 shrimp = (90 shrimp...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Emily to both peel and cook 90 shrimp. We will break down the problem into two parts: peeling and cooking.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. We need to find out how many minutes it will take her to peel 90 shrimp.

\[
\text{Time to peel 90 shrimp} = \frac{\text{Total shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp per minute}} = \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's understand Emily's rates:
* Peeling: 6 shrimp per minute
* Sautéing: 30 shrimp in 10 minutes = 3 shrimp per minute

2. For 90 shrimp, let's calculate peeling time:
* Peeling rate = 6 shrimp/minute
* Time to peel = 90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute
* Time to peel = 15 minutes

3. Now calculate sautéing time:
* Sautéing rate = 30 shrimp/10 minutes
* Time to saute = 90 shrimp ÷ (30 shrimp/10 minutes)
* Time t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. 

Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. Therefore, to find out how long it will take her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Next, let's find out how long it will take Emily to saute 90 shrimp. 

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to find out how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply the result by 10. 

(90 ÷ 30) x 10 = 30 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

Given:
- Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.
- Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.
- We need to find the time it takes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to peel 90 shrimp.
- Emily peels 6 shrimp per minute.
- To find the time needed to peel 90 shrimp, divide 90 by 6.
Time to peel 90 shrimp = 90 ÷ 6 = 15 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to saute 90 shrimp....
