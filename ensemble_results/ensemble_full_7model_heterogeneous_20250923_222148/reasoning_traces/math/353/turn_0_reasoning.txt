=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing.

1. **Calculate the time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spends 6 hours boating.
   - He spends half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent swimming} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching shows is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**
   - Now, we can add the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
     \[
     \text{Total time spent on activities} = \text{Time spent boating} + \text{Time spent swimming} + \text{Time spent watching shows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time spent on activities} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time John spent on vacation:**
   - According to the problem, the 15 hours spent on activities represents 30% of the total time he spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 15
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{15}{0.30} = 50 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   - We know that John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \text{Time spent sightseeing} = 0.40T = 0.40 \times 50 = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - Thus, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \boxed{20} \text{ hours}
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the time spent on known activities:
* Boating = 6 hours
* Swimming = half of boating = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 hours
* Shows = 3 shows × 2 hours each = 6 hours

2. Total time for these activities:
* Total = Boating + Swimming + Shows
* Total = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours

3. We know these activities represent 30% of total vacation time
* If 15 hours = 30%
* To find 100%, divide 15 by 30 and multiply by 100
* Total v...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total time John spent on boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time, which is 3 hours, swimming. So, he spent a total of 6 + 3 = 9 hours on boating and swimming.

He also watched 3 different shows which were 2 hours each. So, he spent 3 * 2 = 6 hours watching shows.

So, the total time he spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is 9 + 6 = 15 hours.

According to the problem, this was 30% of the time he spent. So, we...
