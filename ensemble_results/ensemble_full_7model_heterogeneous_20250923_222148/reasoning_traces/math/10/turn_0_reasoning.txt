=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we will calculate the downloads for each month step by step and then sum them up.

1. **First Month Downloads:**
   The problem states that there were 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month Downloads:**
   The downloads in the second month were three times the downloads in the first month. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 2} = 3 \times \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads:**
   The downloads in the third month were reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we need to calculate 30% of the second month's downloads:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   Now, we subtract this reduction from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads:
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 3} = \text{Downloads in Month 2} - 30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
   Now, we can find the total downloads by adding the downloads from all three months:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{Downloads in Month 1} + \text{Downloads in Month 2} + \text{Downloads in Month 3}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   60 + 180 = 240
   \]
   \[
   240 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The program had 60 downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month.
- The number of downloads in the third month was reduced by 30% compared to the second month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of downloads in the second month.
Downloads in the second month = 3 × Downloads in the first month

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the program had 60 downloads in the first month. 

In the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to find the number of downloads in the second month:

60 downloads * 3 = 180 downloads

In the third month, the number of downloads reduced by 30% from the second month. To find this, we first need to calculate 30% of the second month's downloads. We do this by multiplying 180 by 0.30:
