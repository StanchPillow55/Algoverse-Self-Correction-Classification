=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs each of Chatty's four children will receive when she has prepared three dozen eggs.

1. **Understanding the quantity of eggs:**
   - A dozen is equal to 12 eggs.
   - Therefore, three dozen eggs can be calculated as:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
     \]

2. **Dividing the total number of eggs among the children:**
   - Chatty has four children, and we need to divide the total number of eggs (36) equally among them.
   - To find out how many eggs each child receives, we perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Number of eggs per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of eggs}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{36}{4}
     \]

3. **Calculating the division:**
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{36}{4} = 9
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Each child receives 9 eggs.

Thus, the final answer is that each child receives **9 eggs**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
- Chatty has four children.
- Each child should get the same number of eggs.

Step 1: Convert three dozen eggs to the total number of eggs.
1 dozen = 12 eggs
3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs

Step 2: Divide the total number of eggs by the number of children to find the number of eggs each child receives.
Total number of eggs = 36
Number of children = 4
Number of egg...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many eggs each child receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Chatty prepared three dozen eggs.
   - There are four children.
   - Each child should receive the same number of eggs.

2. **Convert Dozens to Individual Eggs:**
   - A dozen is equal to 12 items.
   - Therefore, three dozen eggs is calculated as follows:
     \[
     3 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs per dozen} = 36 \text{ eggs}...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Chatty prepared three dozen eggs
* She has four children
* Each child gets the same number of eggs

2. Convert dozens to individual eggs:
* 1 dozen = 12 eggs
* 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs

3. To find eggs per child, divide total eggs by number of children:
* 36 eggs ÷ 4 children = 9 eggs per child

4. Let's verify this makes sense:
* 9 eggs × 4 children = 36 eggs total
* This ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the number of dozens of eggs into individual eggs. Since one dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. Since there are four children, we divide 36 by 4.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, each child receives 9 eggs.

Therefore, each child gets 9 eggs for the Easter activity.
