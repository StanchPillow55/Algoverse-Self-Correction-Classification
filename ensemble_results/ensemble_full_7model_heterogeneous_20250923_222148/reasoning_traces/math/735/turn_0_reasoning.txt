=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many votes each candidate received and then find out how many votes candidate C received.

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A:**
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes for candidate A is:
     \[
     \text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B:**
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - To find 50% of candidate A's votes:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total votes for candidate B is:
     \[
     \text{Votes for B} = \text{Votes for A} + 50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
     \]

3. **Determine the total votes accounted for candidates A and B:**
   - The total votes for candidates A and B combined is:
     \[
     \text{Total votes for A and B} = \text{Votes for A} + \text{Votes for B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C:**
   - The total number of voters is 100, so the votes for candidate C can be calculated by subtracting the votes for A and B from the total votes:
     \[
     \text{Votes for C} = \text{Total voters} - \text{Total votes for A and B} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Candidate C received 50 votes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}

   - Since there were 100 voters, the number of votes for candidate A is:
     \[
     \text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
- Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A's votes.
- The remaining votes were given to candidate C.
- There were 100 voters.

Step 1: Calculate the number of votes for candidate A.
Since candidate A got 20% of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes as follows:
20% of 100 voters = 0.20 × 100 = 20 votes for candidate A

Step 2: Calculate ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many votes each candidate received and then find out how many votes candidate C got.

1. **Determine the number of votes candidate A received:**

   Candidate A received 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, we calculate the number of votes for candidate A as follows:

   \[
   \text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of votes candidate B r...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find candidate A's votes:
* Total voters = 100
* Candidate A got 20% of votes
* Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 = 0.20 × 100 = 20 votes

2. Next, let's find candidate B's votes:
* Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A
* 50% more means multiply by 1.5
* Candidate B's votes = 20 × 1.5 = 30 votes

3. Now we can find candidate C's votes:
* Total votes = 100
* Candidate C's votes = Total votes - (Can...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Candidate A got 20% of the votes. Since there were 100 voters, this means Candidate A got 20% * 100 = <<20*.01*100=20>>20 votes.

Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A. This means Candidate B got 50% * 20 = <<50*.01*20=10>>10 more votes than Candidate A.

So, Candidate B got 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 votes.

The total votes that Candidates A and B got is 20 + 30 = <<20+30=50>>50 votes.

Since there were 100 voters, this means Candidate C got 100 - 50 = <<100-50=5...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 100 voters in total.
   * Candidate A got 20% of the votes.
   * Candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A.
   * Candidate C got the remaining votes.

2. Calculate the number of votes candidate A received:
   * Candidate A's votes = 20% of 100 voters
   * Candidate A's votes = 0.20 × 100 = 20 votes

3. Calculate the number of votes candidate B rec...
