Final Answer: To solve the problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

From the problem, we know two things:

1. The total number of animals (chickens and cows) is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \)  (Equation 2)

We can simplify Equation 2 by dividing all terms by 2:
\[
c + 2w = 35  \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

Now we have:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)  (Equation 3)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate \( c \):
\[
(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2w - w = 15
\]
\[
w = 15
\]

Now that we have \( w \), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
\[
c = 20 - 15
\]
\[
c = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

To verify, we can check the total number of legs:
- Chickens: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Cows: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 10 + 60 = 70 \) legs

Everything checks out.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to set up an equation and then solve for the number of chickens.

Given information:
- Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals on his farm, all either chickens or cows.
- The total number of legs of all the animals is 70.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of chickens.
- Let y be the number of cows.

We know that the total number of animals is 20, so we can write the equation:
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the 20 animals are chickens, given that the total number of legs is 70. We know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens
- \( w \) as the number of cows

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

We can solve ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * Total number of animals = 20
   * Total number of legs = 70
   * Chickens have 2 legs each
   * Cows have 4 legs each

2) Let's use variables:
   * Let x = number of chickens
   * Then (20 - x) = number of cows
   * (since total animals = 20)

3) Set up an equation using total legs:
   * (2 × chickens) + (4 × cows) = 70
   * 2x + 4(20-x) = 70

4) Solve the equation:
   * 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. 

We know two things from the problem:

1. C + K = 20 (because there are 20 animals in total)
2. 2C + 4K = 70 (because chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4, and all together they have 70 legs)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's express K from the first equation: K = 20 - C.

Now, we can substitute K in the second equation: 2C + 4*(20 - C) = 70.

This simplifies to: 2C + 8...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals.
   * The animals are either chickens or cows.
   * The total number of legs for all animals is 70.

2. Know the number of legs each animal has:
   * A chicken has 2 legs.
   * A cow has 4 legs.

3. Let's define variables:
   * Let 'x' be the number of chickens.
   * Since the total number of animals is 20, the number of cows will b...
