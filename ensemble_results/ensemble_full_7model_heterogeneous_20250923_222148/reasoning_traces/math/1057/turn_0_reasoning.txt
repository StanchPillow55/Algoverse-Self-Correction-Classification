=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch over the course of 4 weekends, given their viewing habits on Saturday and Sunday.

1. **Movies Watched on Saturday:**
   Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies Watched on Sunday:**
   According to the problem, they watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, the number of movies watched on Sunday can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Movies on Sunday} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Movies on Saturday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
   \]

3. **Total Movies Watched in One Weekend:**
   Now, we can find the total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday + Sunday):
   \[
   \text{Total movies in one weekend} = \text{Movies on Saturday} + \text{Movies on Sunday} = 4 + 2 = 6
   \]

4. **Total Movies Watched in 4 Weeks:**
   Since they watch movies every weekend, we need to calculate the total number of movies watched over 4 weekends:
   \[
   \text{Total movies in 4 weeks} = \text{Total movies in one weekend} \times 4 = 6 \times 4 = 24
   \]

Thus, the total number of movies that Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. So, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch:

4 movies on Saturday + 1/2 * 4 movies on Sunday = 4 + 2 = 6 movies

So, in one weekend, they watch 6 movies.

In 4 weeks, there are 4 weekends. So, in 4 weeks, they can watch:

4 weekends * 6 movies per weekend = 24 movies

So, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.

Final Answer: Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.
