=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of cars originally on the motorway**: 
   - We are given that there were originally 30 cars.

2. **Determine the cars that took an exit**:
   - It is stated that 5 cars took an exit to avoid the traffic jam. 
   - Therefore, the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam after these 5 cars exited is:
     \[
     30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Understand the traffic flow**:
   - We know that some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes, and then 20 more cars drove through in the next 15 minutes.

4. **Let \( x \) be the number of cars that drove through in the first 15 minutes**:
   - After the first 15 minutes, the number of cars remaining in the traffic jam would be:
     \[
     25 - x \text{ cars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of cars remaining after the second 15 minutes**:
   - In the second 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through. Therefore, the number of cars remaining after the second 15 minutes would be:
     \[
     (25 - x) - 20 = 5 - x \text{ cars}
     \]

6. **Set up the equation**:
   - For the traffic jam to be completely cleared, the number of cars remaining after the second 15 minutes must equal zero:
     \[
     5 - x = 0
     \]

7. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is \( \boxed{5} \). 

This means that in the first 15 minutes, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.
- Some cars drove through in the first 15 minutes of the traffic jam.
- 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam.
- 5 cars from the line took an exit and did not drive through the traffic jam.

To find the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to work backwards from...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are originally 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Exit Cars:**
   - 5 cars take an exit and do not drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, these cars should be subtracted from the total number of cars that will drive through the traffic jam.
   - Cars remaining to drive through the tra...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Originally 30 cars on the motorway
- Some cars drive through in first 15 minutes (this is what we need to find)
- 20 cars drive through in last 15 minutes
- 5 cars take an exit and don't go through the jam

Step 1: Let's identify what happens to all 30 original cars
- Some cars go through in first 15 minutes (let's call this x)
- 20 cars go through in last 15 minutes
- 5 cars take exit
Total mus...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as x.

According to the problem, 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes of the jam. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is x + 20.

The problem also states that 5 cars took an exit, so they didn't have to drive through the traffic jam. Therefore, the total number of cars that either drove through the traffic jam or took an exit is x + 20 +...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- The traffic jam lasts for 30 minutes in total.
- Some cars drive through in the first 15 minutes.
- 20 more cars drive through in the remaining 15 minutes.
- 5 cars from the line take an exit and don't drive through the traffic jam.
- There were originally 30 cars on the motorway.

Step 1: Determine the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam.
Total cars that drove through = Origina...
