=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth based on the information given about their ages relative to each other and then find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.

1. **Identify Erica's age**: We are given that Erica is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Beth's age**: The problem states that Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Since Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Alice's age**: The problem also states that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. Now that we know Beth's age, we can find Alice's age:
   \[
   \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age**: Now that we have both Alice's and Erica's ages, we can find the difference:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12
   \]

Thus, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \( \boxed{12} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Alice and Beth based on the information given about their ages relative to each other and then find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.

1. **Identify Erica's age**: We are given that Erica is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Beth's age**: The problem states that Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Since Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age as follows:

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
- Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
- Erica is 30 years old.

Step 1: Find Beth's age.
Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age.
Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5 = 35 years old

Step 2: Find Alice's age.
Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, we can calculate Alice's age.
Alice's age = Beth...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Alice and Erica and then find the difference between their ages.

Let's define the ages of the three individuals:

1. Erica's age is given as 30 years old.
2. Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Therefore, Beth's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years old}
   \]
3. Alice is 7 years older than Beth. Therefore, Alice's age can be calculated as:
   \[
   \...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Erica is 30 years old
* Beth is 5 years older than Erica
* Alice is 7 years older than Beth

Step 1: Find Beth's age
* Beth is 5 years older than Erica
* Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
* Beth's age = 30 + 5 = 35 years old

Step 2: Find Alice's age
* Alice is 7 years older than Beth
* Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
* Alice's age = 35 + 7 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the difference between Alice and Erica's ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how old Beth is. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can add 5 to Erica's age to find out Beth's age.

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35 years old

Next, we need to find out how old Alice is. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and we now know that Beth is 35 years old, we can add 7 to Beth's age to find out Alice's age.

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice'...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Alice is 7 years older than Beth.
   * Beth is 5 years older than Erica.
   * Erica is 30 years old.

2. Find Beth's age:
   * Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can calculate Beth's age:
   * Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
   * Beth's age = 30 + 5 = 35 years old

3. Find Alice's age:
   * Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, a...
