=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of People**: 
   At 8:00, there are 5000 people in line.

2. **People Who Voted by Midday**: 
   By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted. We can calculate how many people that is:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by midday} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
   \]

3. **Remaining People After Midday**: 
   To find the number of people remaining after midday, we subtract the number of people who voted from the initial number:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 5000 - 2000 = 3000
   \]

4. **People Who Voted by 16:00**: 
   By 16:00, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining people had voted. We calculate how many people that is:
   \[
   \text{People who voted by 16:00} = \frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
   \]

5. **Remaining People After 16:00**: 
   To find the number of people who had not voted by 16:00, we subtract the number of people who voted by 16:00 from the remaining number of people after midday:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people after 16:00} = 3000 - 2000 = 1000
   \]

Thus, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is \( \boxed{1000} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
2. Calculate the number of people who had voted by 16:00.
3. Calculate the number of people who had not voted by 16:00.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who had voted by midday (12:00).
* At 8:00, there were 5000 people lined up to vote.
* By midday (12:00), 2/5 of the people had voted.
* To find the number of people who had...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people have not voted by 16:00. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of People:**
   - There are initially 5000 people lined up to vote.

2. **People Who Voted by Midday:**
   - By midday, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the people had voted.
   - Calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5000:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = \frac{2 \times 5000}{5} = \frac{10000}{5} = 2000
     \]
   - So, 2000 people ha...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Initial number of people at 8:00
* Starting number = 5000 people

2) Number who voted by midday
* Fraction who voted by midday = 2/5
* Number who voted = 5000 × 2/5 = 2000 people
* Remaining after midday = 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

3) Number who voted by 16:00
* Of the 3000 remaining, 2/3 voted
* Number who voted in this period = 3000 × 2/3 = 2000 people
* Remaining after 16:00 = 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine the number of people who had voted by midday.
By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted. So, we need to calculate 2/5 of 5000. 

2/5 * 5000 = 2000 people

So, by midday, 2000 people had voted.

Step 2: Determine the number of people who had not voted by midday.
To find this, we subtract the number of people who had voted by midday from the total number of people.

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

So, by midday, 3000 peo...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of people in line and calculate how many people remain after each time point.

Given:
- At 8:00, there were 5000 people in line to vote.
- By midday, 2/5 of the people had voted.
- By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who voted by midday.
People who voted by midday = 2/5 × 5000
                            = 2000
