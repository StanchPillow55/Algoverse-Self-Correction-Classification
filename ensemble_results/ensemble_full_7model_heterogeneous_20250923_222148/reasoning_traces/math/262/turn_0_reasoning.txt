Final Answer: To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we can break the problem down into a few simple steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the boxes:**
   Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Marbles per box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = 5 \times 50 = 250
   \]

2. **Add the marbles received from her friend:**
   Maddison receives 20 additional marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the marbles she received to the total number of marbles she already has:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = \text{Total marbles in boxes} + \text{Marbles received from friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = 250 + 20 = 270
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   After performing the calculations, we find that Maddison has a total of 270 marbles.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{270}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles Maddison has after receiving additional marbles from her friend. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of marbles Maddison initially has:**

   Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in these boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles per box:

   \[

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the marbles in the boxes
* Number of boxes = 5
* Marbles per box = 50
* Total marbles in boxes = 5 × 50 = 250 marbles

Step 2: Add the marbles from her friend
* Marbles from friend = 20
* Total marbles = Marbles in boxes + Marbles from friend
* Total marbles = 250 + 20 = 270 marbles

Reasoning:
* First I found how many marbles were in all the boxes by multiplying boxes by marbles per box
* Then I a...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Maddison initially has 5 boxes of marbles, with 50 marbles in each box. To find out how many marbles she has in total, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box. 

So, 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, Maddison gets an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find out how many marbles she has now, we need to add these 20 marbles to the 250 she already had.

So, 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Therefore, Maddison now ...
