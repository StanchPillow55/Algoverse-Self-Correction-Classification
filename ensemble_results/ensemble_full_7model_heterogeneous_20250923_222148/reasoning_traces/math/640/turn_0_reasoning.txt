=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up with the base price of the truck. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: 
   \[
   \text{Base Price} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the King Cab Upgrade**: 
   \[
   \text{King Cab Upgrade} = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Leather Seats**: 
   The leather seats cost one-third of the king cab upgrade. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Running Boards**: 
   The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. Thus, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: 
   \[
   \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost Calculation**: 
   Now we sum all the costs together:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
   \]

   Now we perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the base price and the king cab upgrade:
     \[
     30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500
     \]
   - Next, add the leather seats:
     \[
     37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000
     \]
   - Then, add the running boards:
     \[
     40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000
     \]
   - Finally, add the upgraded exterior light package:
     \[
     42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
     \]

7. **Final Answer**: 
   The total cost of Bill's new truck is:
   \[
   \boxed{43,500} \text{ dollars}
   \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the base price of the truck:
   * Base price = $30,000

2. The king cab upgrade:
   * King cab = $7,500

3. Let's calculate the cost of leather seats:
   * Leather seats = 1/3 × king cab cost
   * Leather seats = 1/3 × $7,500
   * Leather seats = $2,500

4. Calculate running boards cost:
   * Running boards = leather seats cost - $500
   * Running boards = $2,500 - $500
   * Running boards =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

1. The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500.

2. The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate this by dividing the cost of the king cab upgrade by 3: $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.

3. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. So, we subtract $500 from the cost of the leather seats: $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.

4. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add u...
