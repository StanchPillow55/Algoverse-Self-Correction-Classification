=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**: 
   Erin starts with 7 lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Initial lollipops} = 7
   \]

2. **Lollipops Given by Mother**: 
   Erin's mother gives her 10 more lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops given by mother} = 10
   \]

3. **Total Lollipops After Mother's Gift**: 
   To find out how many lollipops Erin has after receiving the additional lollipops from her mother, we add the initial count to the number given by her mother.

   \[
   \text{Total lollipops} = \text{Initial lollipops} + \text{Lollipops given by mother}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lollipops} = 7 + 10 = 17
   \]

4. **Lollipops Given to Ella**: 
   Erin gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops given to Ella} = 3
   \]

5. **Total Lollipops After Giving to Ella**: 
   To find out how many lollipops Erin has left after giving some to Ella, we subtract the number of lollipops given to Ella from the total lollipops Erin had after her motherâ€™s gift.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops left} = \text{Total lollipops} - \text{Lollipops given to Ella}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lollipops left} = 17 - 3 = 14
   \]

Thus, after all the transactions, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

**Final Answer**: Erin has 14 lollipops left.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Erin initially has 7 lollipops.
- Erin's mother gives her 10 more lollipops.
- Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more.
Initial number of lollipops + Number of lollipops given by mother = Total number of lollipops
7 + 10 = 17 lollipops

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops Erin has left after giving 3 to ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of addition and subtraction based on the information given.

1. **Initial Number of Lollipops:**
   Erin starts with 7 lollipops.

2. **Adding Lollipops from Her Mother:**
   Erin's mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops. To find out how many lollipops Erin has after receiving more from her mother, we add the 10 lollipops to the 7 she already has:
   \[
   7 + 10 = 17
   \]
   So, Erin now has 17 lollipops.

3. **Gi...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Erin starts with 7 lollipops
* She gets 10 more lollipops from her mother
* She gives 3 lollipops to Ella

2. Let's find the total lollipops Erin had before giving any away:
* Initial lollipops + New lollipops = Total lollipops
* 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops

3. Now we subtract the lollipops she gave to Ella:
* Total lollipops - Lollipops given away = Remaining lollipops
* 17 - 3 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Erin starts with 7 lollipops. Her mother gives her another 10 lollipops. We add these together to find out how many lollipops Erin has in total.

7 lollipops + 10 lollipops = 17 lollipops

Then, Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella. We subtract these from Erin's total to find out how many she has left.

17 lollipops - 3 lollipops = 14 lollipops

So, Erin has 14 lollipops left.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Erin initially has 7 lollipops.
- Her mother gives her 10 more lollipops.
- Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her 10 more.
Total lollipops = Initial lollipops + Lollipops given by her mother
Total lollipops = 7 + 10 = 17

So, Erin now has 17 lollipops in total.

Step 2: Calculate the number of lollipops Erin has left aft...
