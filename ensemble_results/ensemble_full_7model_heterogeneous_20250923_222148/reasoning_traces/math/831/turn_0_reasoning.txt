=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total cost for Angela's installation, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the base installation cost**: The interior design firm charges a flat fee of $129.00 for the installation of a specific set of items:
   - 4 mirrors
   - 2 shelves
   - 1 chandelier
   - 10 pictures

2. **Identify Angela's items**: Angela has the following items that need installation:
   - 6 mirrors
   - 2 chandeliers
   - 20 pictures

3. **Calculate the number of additional items**: 
   - **Mirrors**: Angela has 6 mirrors, but the base installation includes 4 mirrors. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     6 - 4 = 2 \text{ additional mirrors}
     \]
   - **Chandeliers**: Angela has 2 chandeliers, but the base installation includes only 1 chandelier. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     2 - 1 = 1 \text{ additional chandelier}
     \]
   - **Pictures**: Angela has 20 pictures, but the base installation includes only 10 pictures. Therefore, she has:
     \[
     20 - 10 = 10 \text{ additional pictures}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of additional items**: 
   - Total additional items = additional mirrors + additional chandeliers + additional pictures
   \[
   2 + 1 + 10 = 13 \text{ additional items}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of additional items**: The firm charges $15.00 for each additional item. Therefore, the cost for 13 additional items is:
   \[
   13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost**: The total cost for Angela will be the base installation cost plus the cost of additional items:
   \[
   129 + 195 = 324 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total cost for Angela's installation will be:
\[
\boxed{324}
\]
