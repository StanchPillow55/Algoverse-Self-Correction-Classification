=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to analyze the purchases made by each group of customers.

1. **First 3 customers**: Each of these customers buys 1 DVD.
   - Number of DVDs sold to the first 3 customers = 3 customers × 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs.

2. **Next 2 customers**: Each of these customers buys 2 DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold to the next 2 customers = 2 customers × 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs.

3. **Last 3 customers**: These customers do not buy any DVDs.
   - Number of DVDs sold to the last 3 customers = 3 customers × 0 DVDs/customer = 0 DVDs.

Now, we will add the total number of DVDs sold from each group:

- Total DVDs sold = DVDs sold to first 3 customers + DVDs sold to next 2 customers + DVDs sold to last 3 customers
- Total DVDs sold = 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Thus, the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday is **7 DVDs**. 

Final answer: **7 DVDs**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's break down the problem into parts. 

We know that Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday. 

The first 3 customers buy one DVD each. So, we multiply the number of customers (3) by the number of DVDs each customer bought (1). 

3 customers * 1 DVD/customer = 3 DVDs

Next, his next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each. So, we multiply the number of these customers (2) by the number of DVDs each of these customers bought (2).

2 customers * 2 DVDs/customer = 4 DVDs
