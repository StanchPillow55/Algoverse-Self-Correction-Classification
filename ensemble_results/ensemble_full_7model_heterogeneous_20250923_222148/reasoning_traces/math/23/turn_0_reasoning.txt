Final Answer: To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time the candle burns**: 
   - The burning period starts at 1:00 PM and ends at 5:00 PM.
   - To find the duration, we subtract the start time from the end time:
     \[
     5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which the candle melts**:
   - The problem states that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. **Calculate the total melting over the burning period**:
   - Since the candle melts 2 centimeters each hour, we can calculate the total melting over the 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total melting} = \text{melting rate} \times \text{total hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total melting} = 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **State the final answer**:
   - After burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8 \text{ centimeters}}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
- The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

To find how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burned and then multiply it by the melting rate.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours the candle burned.
Time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM = 5 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Duration of Burning:**
   - The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
   - To find the duration, we calculate the difference between the start time and the end time.
   - From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a total of 4 hours.

2. **Calculate the Rate of Melting:**
   - The problem states that the candle ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, I need to find how many hours the candle burns
   * The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM
   * To find total hours: 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

2. I know that:
   * The candle melts 2 centimeters per hour
   * It burns for 4 hours

3. To find total centimeters melted:
   * Multiply hours × centimeters per hour
   * 4 hours × 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeter...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the candle burns at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. 

The time period from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

To find out how many centimeters the candle will have melted in this time, we multiply the number of hours by the rate of burning. 

So, 4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm. 

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour it burns.
   * The candle is burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

2. Calculate the number of hours the candle is burning:
   * From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, there are 4 hours.
   * Calculation: 5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

3. Calculate the total number of centimeters the candle will melt:
   * The candle melts 2 centimeters per hour.
