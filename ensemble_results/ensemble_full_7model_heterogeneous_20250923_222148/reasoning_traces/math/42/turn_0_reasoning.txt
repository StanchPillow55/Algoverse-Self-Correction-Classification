=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests after Grandma Jones baked and cut the pies.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of pie:**
   Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of pieces as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

   So, there are a total of 40 pieces of pie.

2. **Determine the number of pieces remaining:**
   At the end of the evening, it is stated that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

3. **Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests:**
   To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

   \[
   \text{Pieces taken} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Remaining pieces}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pieces taken} = 40 - 14 = 26
   \]

Thus, the number of pieces taken by the guests is \( \boxed{26} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
- Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
- At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of pie that were available.
Total number of pieces = Number of pies × Number of pieces per pie
Total number of pieces = 5 × 8 = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces taken by the guests.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We can do this by following these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pie pieces initially available:**

   Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies, and each pie was cut into 8 pieces. Therefore, the total number of pieces from all the pies is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie} = 5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

   So, ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of pie pieces at the start:
* 5 pies × 8 pieces per pie = 40 total pieces

2. We know that 14 pieces remained at the end
* Starting pieces - Remaining pieces = Pieces taken by guests
* 40 - 14 = 26 pieces were taken by guests

Let me verify:
* Total pieces at start: 40
* Pieces remaining: 14
* Pieces taken: 26
* Check: 26 + 14 = 40 ✓

Final Answer: 26 pieces of pie were tak...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces of pie Grandma Jones initially had. Since she cut each of her 5 pies into 8 pieces, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the total number of pieces. 

5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Next, we need to find out how many pieces were taken by the guests. We know that there were 14 pieces left at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies.
   * Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   * At the end of the evening, 14 pieces of pie remained.

2. Calculate the total number of pie pieces Grandma Jones prepared:
   * Number of pies = 5
   * Pieces per pie = 8
   * Total pieces = Number of pies × Pieces per pie
   * Total pieces = 5 × 8 = 40
   So, Grandma Jones prepared a tot...
