=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Items Requested by Dr. Grumpus:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Items Gathered by Igor:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half as many as requested.
     \[
     \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested.
     \[
     \text{Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
     \]
   - Beakers: Igor gathered the correct number, but we need to find out how many he lost.

3. **Total Items Gathered by Igor:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of beakers Igor actually gathered.
   - The total number of items Igor placed on the lab bench is given as 29. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Total items} = \text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers} + \text{Petri dishes}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   29 = 8 + x + 16
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   \[
   29 = 24 + x
   \]
   To isolate \( x \), we subtract 24 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 29 - 24 = 5
   \]

5. **Determining the Number of Beakers Lost:**
   - Since Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers and Igor gathered 5, the number of beakers Igor lost is:
   \[
   \text{Beakers lost} = \text{Requested beakers} - \text{Beakers gathered} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Igor lost **2 beakers**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial Request:**
   - Dr. Grumpus requested:
     - 16 test tubes
     - 7 beakers
     - 14 Petri dishes

2. **Determine What Igor Gathered:**

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's first identify what Dr. Grumpus requested:
   * 16 test tubes
   * 7 beakers
   * 14 Petri dishes
   * Total requested = 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 items

2. Now let's identify what Igor actually gathered:
   * Test tubes: Half of 16 = 8 test tubes
   * Petri dishes: 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes
   * Beakers: Started with 7 but lost some
   * We know the total on bench = 29 items

3. Let's solve for lost beakers:
   * If...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many test tubes and Petri dishes Igor gathered.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered 16/2 = <<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.

Now, let's calculate how many items Igor should have had in total if he hadn't lost any beakers. This is the sum of the number of test tubes, Petri dishes, an...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
   * Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested.
   * Igor gathered two more Petri dishes than requested.
   * Igor picked up the correct number of beakers but lost some on the way to the lab bench.
   * In total, Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench.

2. Calculate the number of test tu...
