=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define variables for each ingredient in Tanya's salt scrub and set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem.

Let:
- \( z \) = amount of citrus zest (in ounces)
- \( f \) = amount of fragrance (in ounces)
- \( s \) = amount of salt (in ounces)
- \( o \) = amount of oil (in ounces)
- \( u \) = amount of sugar (in ounces)

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. **Same amount of citrus zest as fragrance**: 
   \[
   z = f
   \]

2. **Same amount of salt as sugar**: 
   \[
   s = u
   \]

3. **Twice as much oil as salt**: 
   \[
   o = 2s
   \]

4. **Twice as much salt as zest**: 
   \[
   s = 2z
   \]

Now, we know that the total amount of the scrub must fill a 10-ounce jar. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total volume:
\[
z + f + s + o + u = 10
\]

Substituting the relationships we have into this equation:

1. Substitute \( z = f \) into the total volume equation:
   \[
   z + z + s + o + u = 10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2z + s + o + u = 10
   \]

2. Substitute \( s = u \) into the equation:
   \[
   2z + s + o + s = 10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2z + 2s + o = 10
   \]

3. Substitute \( o = 2s \) into the equation:
   \[
   2z + 2s + 2s = 10
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2z + 4s = 10
   \]

4. Divide the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   z + 2s = 5
   \]

5. Now, substitute \( s = 2z \) into the equation:
   \[
   z + 2(2z) = 5
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   z + 4z = 5
   \]
   \[
   5z = 5
   \]
   \[
   z = 1
   \]

Now that we have \( z \), we can find the other variables:

- Since \( z = 1 \), we can find \( f \):
  \[
  f = z = 1
  \]

- Now, find \( s \) using \( s = 2z \):
  \[
  s = 2(1) = 2
  \]

- Find \( u \) (which is equal to \( s \)):
  \[
  u = s = 2
  \]

- Finally, find \( o \) using \( o = 2s \):
  \[
  o = 2(2) = 4
  \]

Now we have all the amounts:
- \( z = 1 \) ounce
- \( f = 1 \) ounce
- \( s = 2 \) ounces
- \( u = 2 \) ounces
- \( o = 4 \) ounces

To summarize, the amount of oil Tanya uses is:
\[
\boxed{4} \text{ ounces}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tanya makes enough salt scrub to fill a 10-ounce jar each time.
- She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.
- She uses the same amount of salt as sugar.
- She uses twice as much oil as salt.
- She uses twice as much salt as zest.

Let's assign variables to represent the amounts of each ingredient:
- Let x = amount of zest and fragrance
- Let y = amount of salt and sugar
- Let ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of each ingredient Tanya uses in her salt scrub, given the relationships between the amounts of each ingredient. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( z \) be the amount of citrus zest (in ounces).
   - Since the amount of fragrance is the same as the amount of citrus zest, the fragrance is also \( z \) ounces.
   - Let \( s \) be the amount of salt (in ounces).
   - Since the a...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* Total mixture = 10 ounces
* Amount of citrus zest = amount of fragrance
* Amount of salt = amount of sugar
* Oil is twice as much as salt
* Salt is twice as much as zest

2) Let's use variables to represent amounts:
* Let zest = x ounces
* Then fragrance = x ounces (same as zest)
* Salt = 2x ounces (twice zest)
* Sugar = 2x ounces (same as salt)
* Oil = 4x ounces (twice salt)

3) Si...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x ounces each. According to the problem, Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so those are also x ounces each. 

The problem also states that she uses twice as much oil as salt. Since the amount of salt is x ounces, the amount of oil she uses is 2x ounces.

Finally, the problem says that she uses twice as much salt as zest. Since the amount of zest is x ounces, this means that x = 2x. However, this would impl...
