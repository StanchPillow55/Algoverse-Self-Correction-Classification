Final Answer: To determine how much Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday, we need to break down her earnings based on her regular hourly rate and the additional hours she worked.

1. **Calculate Jamie's regular hourly rate:**
   Jamie earns $20 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of regular hours she worked:**
   Jamie worked a total of 11 hours last Tuesday. However, her regular work hours are 8 hours. Therefore, the number of regular hours she worked is:
   \[
   \text{Regular hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional hours worked:**
   Since she worked 11 hours in total, the additional hours worked beyond her regular hours are:
   \[
   \text{Additional hours} = 11 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate her earnings for regular hours:**
   For the 8 regular hours, her earnings are:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from regular hours} = \text{Regular hours} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 8 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the special hourly rate for additional hours:**
   The special hourly rate for overtime is 150% of her regular hourly rate. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Special hourly rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Regular hourly rate} = 1.5 \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate her earnings for additional hours:**
   For the 3 additional hours, her earnings are:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from additional hours} = \text{Additional hours} \times \text{Special hourly rate} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ dollars/hour} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate total earnings for the day:**
   Now, we add her earnings from regular hours and additional hours to find her total earnings for that day:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from regular hours} + \text{Earnings from additional hours} = 160 \text{ dollars} + 90 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Jamie was paid a total of **$250** for her work last Tuesday.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{250}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify the key information:
* Regular hourly rate = $20
* Regular hours = 8 hours per day
* Overtime rate = 150% of regular rate = $20 × 1.50 = $30 per hour
* Total hours worked = 11 hours

2) Break down the hours:
* Regular hours = 8 hours
* Overtime hours = 11 - 8 = 3 hours

3) Calculate pay for regular hours:
* Regular pay = $20 × 8 hours
* Regular pay = $160

4) Calculate pay for overtime hours...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20. She worked 8 hours at this rate, so her earnings for these hours are:

20 * 8 = $<<20*8=160>>160

For any additional hours, she is paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This means her special hourly rate is:

20 * 1.5 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30

She worked 3 additional hours (11 hours - 8 hours) at this special rate, so her earnings for these hours are:

30 * 3 = $<<30*3=90>>90

To find her total earnings for the day, we add her earnings from h...
