=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate how much money Jayden currently has:**
   - Jayden has $70 from selling pictures.

2. **Calculate how much money Ava gives to Jayden:**
   - Ava's allowance is $90.
   - She gives Jayden half of her allowance:
     \[
     \text{Amount Ava gives} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]

3. **Calculate Jayden's total amount of money after receiving Ava's contribution:**
   - We add the amount Jayden already has to the amount Ava gives him:
     \[
     \text{Total amount Jayden has} = 70 + 45 = 115
     \]

4. **Determine the cost of the camera:**
   - The camera costs $200.

5. **Calculate how much more money Jayden needs:**
   - We subtract the total amount Jayden has from the cost of the camera:
     \[
     \text{Amount needed} = 200 - 115 = 85
     \]

Thus, Jayden needs an additional $85 to buy the camera.

**Final Answer:**
Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what money Jayden has:
   * Jayden's money from selling pictures = $70
   * Ava's allowance = $90
   * Ava gave Jayden half of her allowance = $90 รท 2 = $45

2. Calculate total money Jayden now has:
   * Total = Money from pictures + Money from Ava
   * Total = $70 + $45 = $115

3. Calculate how much more he needs:
   * Camera costs = $200
   * Money needed = Camera cost - Money he has
   * ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jayden initially has $70. His sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance, which is $90 / 2 = $45.

So, Jayden now has $70 (his initial money) + $45 (money from Ava) = $115.

The camera costs $200, so Jayden still needs $200 (cost of the camera) - $115 (Jayden's current money) = $85.

Therefore, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.
