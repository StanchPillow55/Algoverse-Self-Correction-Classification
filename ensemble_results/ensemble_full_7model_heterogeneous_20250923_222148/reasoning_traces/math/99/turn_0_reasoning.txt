=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.**
2. **Determine how many plants she will give away.**
3. **Calculate how many plants she will have left after giving some away.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has.

Mary received 18 new potted plants. She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 

First, we calculate the number of potted plants she has from the window ledges:

\[
\text{Number of plants on window ledges} = \text{Number of ledges} \times \text{Plants per ledge}
\]
\[
\text{Number of plants on window ledges} = 40 \times 2 = 80
\]

Now, we add the new plants she received:

\[
\text{Total number of plants} = \text{Plants on ledges} + \text{New plants}
\]
\[
\text{Total number of plants} = 80 + 18 = 98
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many plants she will give away.

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges. Therefore, the total number of plants she will give away is:

\[
\text{Plants given away} = \text{Number of ledges} = 40
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many plants she will have left after giving some away.

Now, we subtract the number of plants she gives away from her total number of plants:

\[
\text{Plants remaining} = \text{Total number of plants} - \text{Plants given away}
\]
\[
\text{Plants remaining} = 98 - 40 = 58
\]

### Final Answer

After giving away 1 potted plant from each ledge, Mary will have **58 potted plants** remaining.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many potted plants Mary currently has on her window ledges:
* Number of window ledges = 40
* Number of plants per ledge = 2
* Total plants on ledges = 40 × 2 = 80 plants

2. Add the new plants Mary received:
* New plants received = 18
* Total plants = Plants on ledges + New plants
* Total plants = 80 + 18 = 98 plants

3. Calculate how many plants Mary will give away:
* She will give 1 plant ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mary currently has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. This means she has 2*40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants.

In addition to these, she received 18 new potted plants from the nursery. So, in total, she now has 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants.

She plans to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge. Since she has 40 ledges, she will give away 40*1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.

Subtracting the number of plants she gives away from the total number of pl...
