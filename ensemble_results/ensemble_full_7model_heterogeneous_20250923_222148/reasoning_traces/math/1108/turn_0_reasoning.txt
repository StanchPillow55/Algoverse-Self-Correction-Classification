=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money your mom spent at the gardening shop, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items before the coupon.**
   - The cost of the pots is $19.
   - The cost of the sack of garden soil is $26.
   - We add these two amounts together to find the total cost before applying the coupon.

   \[
   \text{Total cost before coupon} = \text{Cost of pots} + \text{Cost of soil}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost before coupon} = 19 + 26
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost before coupon} = 45
   \]

2. **Apply the coupon discount.**
   - Your mom used a coupon for $7 off.
   - We subtract the coupon amount from the total cost before the coupon.

   \[
   \text{Total cost after coupon} = \text{Total cost before coupon} - \text{Coupon amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after coupon} = 45 - 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after coupon} = 38
   \]

3. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the amount of money your mom spent at the gardening shop is $38.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{38}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what my mom bought and the prices:
   * Set of pots = $19
   * Sack of garden soil = $26

2. Calculate the subtotal before the coupon:
   * Subtotal = $19 + $26
   * Subtotal = $45

3. Apply the coupon discount:
   * Coupon discount = $7
   * Final price = Subtotal - Coupon discount
   * Final price = $45 - $7
   * Final price = $38

Therefore, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to add the cost of the pots and the sack of garden soil. 

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the garden soil is $26. 

So, $19 (pots) + $26 (soil) = $45. 

This means that without the coupon, the total cost would have been $45. 

However, my mom had a $7 off coupon. To find out how much she paid after using the coupon, we subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost. 

So, $45 (total cost) - $7 (coupon) = $38.
