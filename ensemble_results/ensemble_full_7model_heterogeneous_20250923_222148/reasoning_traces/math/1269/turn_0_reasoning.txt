=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Elvis is from his house after completing his journey.

1. **Calculate the distance traveled west:**
   - Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 miles per hour (mph).
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance traveled west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles

2. **Calculate the distance traveled east:**
   - After traveling west, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph.
   - Distance traveled east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles

3. **Determine his final position relative to his starting point:**
   - After traveling west, Elvis is 90 miles away from his house in the west direction.
   - When he travels east for 144 miles, he is moving back towards his house.
   - To find his final position, we subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east:
     \[
     \text{Final position} = \text{Distance traveled east} - \text{Distance traveled west}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Final position} = 144 \text{ miles} - 90 \text{ miles} = 54 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Determine the direction:**
   - Since he traveled more distance east (144 miles) than he did west (90 miles), he ends up 54 miles east of his starting point (his house).

Thus, the final answer is that Elvis is **54 miles away from his house**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance Elvis traveled and then calculate his current distance from his house.

Given information:
- Elvis travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.
- Elvis then turns around and travels east for 8 hours at an average speed of 18 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled while driving west.
Distance traveled while driving west = Speed × Time
Distance traveled while driving west = 18 m...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Elvis is from his house after completing his journey. We will break down the journey into two parts: the westward journey and the eastward journey.

### Part 1: Westward Journey

1. **Time Traveled West:** Elvis travels west for 5 hours.
2. **Speed:** His average speed is 18 miles per hour (mph).
3. **Distance Traveled West:** To find the distance traveled west, we use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Spee...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how far Elvis drove west:
* Time going west = 5 hours
* Speed = 18 mph
* Distance west = Speed × Time
* Distance west = 18 mph × 5 hours = 90 miles west

2. Next, let's calculate how far he drove east:
* Time going east = 8 hours
* Speed = 18 mph
* Distance east = Speed × Time
* Distance east = 18 mph × 8 hours = 144 miles east

3. Now, to find how far he is from his house:
* He went 90 mil...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Elvis first travels west for 5 hours at an average speed of 18mph. The distance he covers is given by the formula distance = speed * time. So, the distance he covers while traveling west is:

Distance_west = 18mph * 5 hours = 90 miles

Then, Elvis turns around and travels east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18mph. The distance he covers while traveling east is:

Distance_east = 18mph * 8 hours = 144 miles

Since he is traveling back towards his house, we need to...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elvis first travels west for 5 hours.
   * Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours.
   * His average speed is 18 miles per hour (mph) for both parts of the journey.

2. Calculate the distance Elvis traveled west:
   * Time traveled west = 5 hours
   * Speed = 18 mph
   * Distance traveled west = Time × Speed
   * Distance traveled west = 5 hours × 18 mp...
