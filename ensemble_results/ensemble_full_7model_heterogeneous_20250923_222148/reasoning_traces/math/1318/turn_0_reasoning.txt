=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza each person will get when Henry and his 3 friends share the pizzas equally.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas.**
Henry and his 3 friends ordered 7 pizzas.

**Step 2: Determine the number of slices per pizza.**
Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of slices.**
To find the total number of slices, we multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices per pizza:

\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza}
\]
\[
\text{Total slices} = 7 \times 8 = 56
\]

**Step 4: Determine the total number of people sharing the pizzas.**
Henry has 3 friends, so the total number of people is:

\[
\text{Total people} = 1 \text{ (Henry)} + 3 \text{ (friends)} = 4
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the number of slices per person.**
To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people:

\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Total people}}
\]
\[
\text{Slices per person} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
\]

**Final Answer:**
Each person can have 14 slices of pizza.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* There are 4 people total (Henry and 3 friends)
* They ordered 7 pizzas
* Each pizza has 8 slices

2. Let's find the total number of slices:
* Number of slices per pizza = 8
* Number of pizzas = 7
* Total slices = 8 × 7 = 56 slices

3. Now we can find how many slices each person gets:
* Number of people = 4
* Slices per person = Total slices ÷ Number of people
* S...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of pizza slices. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and they ordered 7 pizzas, we multiply 8 by 7 to get the total number of slices. 

8 slices/pizza * 7 pizzas = 56 slices

Next, we need to find out how many people are sharing the pizzas. Henry and 3 of his friends make a total of 4 people.

Finally, we divide the total number of slices by the total number of people to find out how many slices each person can have.

56 slice...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends).
- They ordered 7 pizzas.
- Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.
- They want to share the pizzas equally.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.
Total slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza
Total slices = 7 × 8 = 56 slices

Step 2: Determine the number of slices each person can have if they share equally.
Slices per pers...
