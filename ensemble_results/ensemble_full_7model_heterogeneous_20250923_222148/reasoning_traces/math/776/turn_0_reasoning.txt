Final Answer: To determine how much you have to pay for a laptop that costs $1000 after applying a 20% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the discount**:
   The discount is calculated as a percentage of the original price. In this case, the original price of the laptop is $1000, and the discount rate is 20%.

   To find the discount amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Rate}}{100}\right)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right)
   \]

   Simplifying the calculation:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200
   \]

   So, the discount amount is $200.

2. **Calculate the final price after the discount**:
   To find the final price you have to pay after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the original price.

   Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 800
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   After applying a 20% discount to the original price of $1000, the amount you have to pay for the laptop is $800.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{800}
\]
