=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Raymond has left, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount of money Raymond has.**
   - Raymond starts with $21.

2. **Calculate the amount of money he saves from his allowance.**
   - He saves $11 from his allowance.
   - To find the total amount after saving, we add the saved amount to his initial amount:
     \[
     21 + 11 = 32
     \]
   - Now, Raymond has $32.

3. **Calculate the amount spent on the comic book.**
   - Raymond spends $5 on a comic book.
   - We subtract this amount from his current total:
     \[
     32 - 5 = 27
     \]
   - After buying the comic book, Raymond has $27 left.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on the puzzle.**
   - Raymond spends $19 on a puzzle.
   - We subtract this amount from his current total:
     \[
     27 - 19 = 8
     \]
   - After buying the puzzle, Raymond has $8 left.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - After all transactions, we find that Raymond has $8 remaining.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Next, we need to subtract the money Raymond spent on the comic book and the puzzle from the total amount of money he had. He spent $5 on the comic book and $19 on the puzzle. 

$5 + $19 = $24

So, Raymond spent a total of $24.
