=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack has after receiving a portion of Sophia's money.

1. **Initial Amount for Jack**: 
   Jack starts with $100.

2. **Sophia's Amount**: 
   Sophia has $100.

3. **Calculating the Amount Sophia Gives to Jack**:
   Sophia gives Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. To find out how much that is, we perform the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100
   \]
   Now, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \times 100 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
   \]
   So, Sophia gives Jack $20.

4. **Calculating Jack's New Total**:
   Now we need to add the amount Jack received from Sophia to his initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Jack's new total} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Amount received from Sophia}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Jack's new total} = 100 + 20
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   100 + 20 = 120
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, after receiving the money from Sophia, Jack now has a total of $120.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jack had $100 initially.
- Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100.

Step 1: Calculate how much money Sophia gave to Jack.
Sophia's money = $100
1/5 of Sophia's money = $100 × 1/5 = $20
Sophia gave Jack $20.

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jack has now.
Jack's initial money = $100
Money received from Sophia = $20
Total money Jack has now = $100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, the final answer is...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Jack has after receiving a portion of Sophia's money.

1. **Initial Amount Jack Has:**
   - Jack initially has $100.

2. **Amount Sophia Gives to Jack:**
   - Sophia has $100.
   - She gives Jack 1/5 of her $100.
   - To find 1/5 of $100, we perform the following calculation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, Sophia gives Jack $20.

3. **Total Amount Jack Has Now:**
   - Jack's init...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Jack starts with $100
* Sophia has $100
* Sophia gives Jack 1/5 of her money

2. Calculate how much money Sophia gives Jack:
* 1/5 of $100 = $100 ÷ 5
* $100 ÷ 5 = $20
* So Sophia gives Jack $20

3. Calculate Jack's final amount:
* Jack's initial amount + Amount from Sophia
* $100 + $20 = $120

Therefore, Jack now has $120.

Final Answer: $120

The reasoning is that we first c...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. 

Sophia had $100 and she gave 1/5 of it to Jack. To find out how much money that is, we divide $100 by 5.

$100 ÷ 5 = $20

So, Sophia gave $20 to Jack.

Next, we add the money Jack originally had to the money Sophia gave him.

Jack had $100 and Sophia gave him $20. 

$100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120. 

Final Answer: Jack has $120.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jack had $100 initially.
- Sophia has $100.
- Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her $100.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Sophia gave to Jack.
Sophia's money given to Jack = 1/5 × Sophia's money
Sophia's money given to Jack = 1/5 × $100
Sophia's money given to Jack = $20

Explanation: To find the amount Sophia gave to Jack, we multiply the fraction (1/5) by Sophia's total money ($100). Thi...
