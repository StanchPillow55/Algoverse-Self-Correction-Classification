Final Answer: To find the total cost of the discounted blouses that Misha picks out, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the regular price of each blouse**: 
   The regular price for each blouse is given as $20.

2. **Calculate the discount amount**: 
   The discount is 30% off the regular price. To find the discount amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Regular Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   Here, the discount rate is 30%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.30). Thus, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 20 \times 0.30 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the sale price of each blouse**: 
   To find the sale price after the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the regular price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \text{Regular Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses**: 
   Misha picks out 4 blouses, so we need to multiply the sale price of one blouse by the number of blouses:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Sale Price} \times \text{Number of Blouses}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 14 \times 4 = 56
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is:
   \[
   \boxed{56}
   \]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of 4 blouses that are each discounted by 30% from their regular price of $20.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Discount Amount for One Blouse:**

   The regular price of one blouse is $20. The discount is 30% of the regular price.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate the discount on a single blouse. Since each blouse is $20 and the discount is 30%, we find the discount by multiplying $20 by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form). 

$20 * 0.30 = $6

So, each blouse is discounted by $6. 

The next step is to subtract the discount from the original price to find the discounted price for each blouse. 

$20 - $6 = $14

So, each blouse costs $14 after the discount. 

Since Misha is buying 4 blouses, we multiply the dis...
