=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many tickets each graduate will receive to give to their friends and family, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seats available for guests**: 
   The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 seats. We need to subtract the number of seats reserved for graduates and faculty.

   - Seats for graduates: 950
   - Seats for faculty: 300

   We can calculate the total number of seats reserved for graduates and faculty:

   \[
   \text{Total reserved seats} = \text{Seats for graduates} + \text{Seats for faculty} = 950 + 300 = 1250
   \]

   Now, we can find the number of seats available for guests by subtracting the reserved seats from the total capacity:

   \[
   \text{Available seats for guests} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total reserved seats} = 6000 - 1250 = 4750
   \]

2. **Determine how many graduates there are**: 
   The problem does not specify the number of graduates directly. However, we can assume that the number of graduates is equal to the number of seats reserved for graduates, which is 950.

3. **Calculate the number of tickets each graduate receives**: 
   To find out how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, we divide the number of available seats for guests by the number of graduates:

   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = \frac{\text{Available seats for guests}}{\text{Number of graduates}} = \frac{4750}{950}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Tickets per graduate} = 5
   \]

Thus, each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.

**Final Answer**: Each graduate receives 5 tickets.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family, and then divide that number equally among the graduates.

Given information:
- The Fine Arts Center has a capacity of 6000 people.
- 950 seats are reserved for graduates.
- 300 seats are reserved for faculty attending.

Step 1: Calculate the number of remaining seats available for the graduates' friends and family.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate can give to their friends and family, given the constraints of the seating capacity in the Fine Arts Center.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Seating Capacity**: The Fine Arts Center has a total seating capacity of 6000 people.

2. **Seats Reserved for Graduates**: There are 950 seats reserved for the graduates themselves.

3. **Seats Reserved for Faculty**: There are 300 se...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total seats available: 6000
* Seats needed for graduates: 950
* Seats needed for faculty: 300
* Need to find tickets per graduate

2. Calculate total seats remaining for friends/family:
* Total seats - Graduate seats - Faculty seats
* 6000 - 950 - 300 = 4750 seats remaining

3. Calculate tickets per graduate:
* Remaining seats รท Number of graduates
* 4750 รท 950 = 5 tic...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to determine how many seats are left for friends and family after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty. 

The Fine Arts Center has a total of 6000 seats. 

Subtract the number of seats for graduates and faculty from the total number of seats:

6000 (total seats) - 950 (graduate seats) - 300 (faculty seats) = 4750 seats left for friends and family.

Next, we need to determine how many tickets each graduate would receive. To do this, we divid...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The Fine Arts Center has a total capacity of 6000 people.
   * 950 seats are reserved for graduates.
   * 300 seats are reserved for faculty.
   * The remaining seats will be split equally among the graduates for their friends and family.

2. Calculate the number of seats available for friends and family:
