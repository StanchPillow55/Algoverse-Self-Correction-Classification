=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we will first calculate the total number of sandwiches each family member eats in one day, and then multiply that by the number of days in a week.

1. **Calculate the daily consumption of sandwiches for each family member:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   - The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

2. **Add the daily consumption of all family members:**
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = \text{sandwiches by man} + \text{sandwiches by wife} + \text{sandwiches by son}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = 5 + 4 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches per day} = 11
   \]

3. **Calculate the total sandwiches consumed in one week:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the total daily consumption by 7:
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = \text{Total sandwiches per day} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = 11 \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sandwiches in one week} = 77
   \]

Thus, the family eats a total of **77 sandwiches in one week**.

Final answer: **77 sandwiches**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week.

Given information:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per day.
Sandwiches eaten by the man per day = 5
Sandwiches eaten by the wife per day = 4
Sandwiches eaten by the son per day = 2

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week. We will calculate the number of sandwiches each family member eats per week and then sum these amounts.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the number of sandwiches the man eats in one week:**
   - The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the number of sandwiches the man eats in one week is:
     \[
     5 \text...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Step 1: Calculate daily sandwich consumption for the family
* Man: 5 sandwiches per day
* Wife: 4 sandwiches per day
* Son: 2 sandwiches per day
* Total daily consumption = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day

Step 2: Calculate weekly sandwich consumption
* One week has 7 days
* Weekly consumption = Daily consumption × 7 days
* Weekly consumption = 11 × 7 = 77 sandwiches

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in on...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate how many sandwiches the family eats in one day. 

The man eats 5 sandwiches per day, his wife eats 4 sandwiches per day, and their son eats 2 sandwiches per day. 

So, in total, they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.

The next step is to calculate how many sandwiches they eat in one week. 

There are 7 days in a week. 

So, the family eats 11 sandwiches per day * 7 days per week = 77 sandwiches per week.

Therefore, the family eats 77 s...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   * His wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
   * Their son eats 2 sandwiches per day.
   * We need to find the total number of sandwiches the family eats in one week.

2. Calculate the number of sandwiches eaten by the man in one week:
   * The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
   * There are 7 days in a week.
   * Number of sandwiches eate...
