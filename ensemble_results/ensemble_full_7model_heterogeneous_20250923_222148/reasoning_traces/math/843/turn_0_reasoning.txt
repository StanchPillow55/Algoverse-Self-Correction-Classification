=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money Craig has initially.**
   - Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills.
   - The total amount of money he has is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the squirt guns.**
   - Craig buys 6 squirt guns, each costing $2.
   - The total cost for the squirt guns is:
     \[
     6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water balloons.**
   - Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons, each costing $3.
   - The total cost for the water balloons is:
     \[
     3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items purchased.**
   - The total cost for both the squirt guns and the water balloons is:
     \[
     12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate how much money Craig has left after his purchases.**
   - We subtract the total cost of the items from the initial amount of money Craig had:
     \[
     40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, after making his purchases, Craig has **$19 left**.

Final answer: Craig has **$19 left**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money Craig spends and then subtract that from the total amount of money he initially has.

**Step 1: Determine Craig's initial amount of money.**

Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills. Each twenty dollar bill is worth $20. Therefore, the total amount of money Craig starts with is:

\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the squirt guns.**

Craig buys six squirt guns, and each squirt gun cos...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much money Craig started with:
* 2 twenty dollar bills = $20 × 2 = $40 initial amount

2. Now let's calculate the cost of the squirt guns:
* Cost per squirt gun = $2
* Number of squirt guns = 6
* Total cost of squirt guns = $2 × 6 = $12

3. Next, let's calculate the cost of water balloons:
* Cost per pack = $3
* Number of packs = 3
* Total cost of water balloons = $3 × 3 = $9

4. Now le...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2*20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

He buys six squirt guns for $2 each, which costs him 6*2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, which costs him 3*3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.

So, in total, Craig spends 12+9 = $<<12+9=21>>21 on squirt guns and water balloons.

He started with $40, so after his purchases, he has 40-21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 left. 

So, Craig has $19 left.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills, which means he has a total of $40.
- He buys 6 squirt guns, each costing $2.
- He also buys 3 packs of water balloons, each costing $3.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the squirt guns.
Cost of squirt guns = Number of squirt guns × Price per squirt gun
