=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we will break down the costs into three components: the service charge, the labor charge, and the cost of parts.

1. **Service Charge**: 
   Patty's Plumbing has a flat service charge of $40 for visiting a house. This is a fixed cost that will be added to the total.

   \[
   \text{Service Charge} = 40
   \]

2. **Labor Charge**: 
   The labor charge is $35 per hour, or part thereof. The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is based on whole hours, we need to round up to the nearest whole hour because any part of an hour counts as a full hour.

   - Rounding 2.25 hours up gives us 3 hours.
   - Therefore, the labor charge will be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Labor Charge} = 35 \times 3 = 105
   \]

3. **Cost of Parts**: 
   The cost of parts used for the job is given as $60.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Parts} = 60
   \]

4. **Total Charge**: 
   Now we can calculate the total charge by adding all the components together:

   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = \text{Service Charge} + \text{Labor Charge} + \text{Cost of Parts}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total Charge} = 205
   \]

Thus, the total amount that Patty charged for the job is **$205**.

Final answer: **$205**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the components of the charge:
   * Visit charge: $40
   * Labor rate: $35 per hour (or part thereof)
   * Parts cost: $60
   * Time spent: 2.25 hours

2. Calculate the labor charge:
   * 2.25 hours means we need to round up to 3 hours (since it's charged per hour or part thereof)
   * Labor cost = $35 × 3 hours = $105

3. Add all components:
   * Visit charge: $40
   * Labor charge: $105
   ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the labor cost. Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour, or part thereof. This means that even if the work takes less than a full hour, the charge will still be for a full hour. 

The job took 2.25 hours. Since Patty charges for part of an hour as a full hour, we need to round 2.25 up to the next whole number, which is 3. 

So, the labor cost is 3 hours times $35 per hour, which equals $105.

Next, we add the visit fee, which is $40.

Finally, we add ...
