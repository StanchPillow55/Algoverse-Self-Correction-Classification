Final Answer: To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pieces of Pizza**: 
   Tobias starts with a total of 60 pieces of pizza.

2. **Pieces Eaten on the First Day**: 
   On the first day, Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total pieces. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining Pieces After the First Day**: 
   After eating 24 pieces, the number of pieces left is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces Eaten on the Second Day**: 
   On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces. We subtract this from the remaining pieces:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces after the second day} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Pieces Eaten on the Third Day**: 
   On the third day, Tobias ate \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces. We first need to calculate how many pieces that is:
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26
   \]
   To compute this, we can simplify:
   \[
   \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{7 \times 26}{13} = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Total Pieces Eaten**: 
   Now we can sum up all the pieces Tobias has eaten over the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} + \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} + \text{Pieces eaten on the third day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces that Tobias has eaten so far is \( \boxed{48} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The pizza has 60 pieces.
- On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pieces.
- On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
- On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
2/5 of 60 pieces = 2/5 × 60 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day.
Total pieces - Pieces eaten on the fi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten over the three days.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.**

Tobias ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the pizza on the first day. The pizza has 60 pieces in total.

\[
\text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the second day...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First day: 2/5 of 60 pieces
* 2/5 × 60 = 24 pieces eaten on first day
* Remaining after first day: 60 - 24 = 36 pieces

2. Second day: 10 pieces
* Eaten: 10 pieces
* Remaining after second day: 36 - 10 = 26 pieces

3. Third day: 7/13 of remaining pieces (26 pieces)
* 7/13 × 26 = (7 × 26)/(13)
* = 182/13 = 14 pieces eaten on third day

4. Total pieces eaten:
* First day: 24 pieces
* Second day: 10 pieces
* Third d...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
We know that Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day. Since the pizza has 60 pieces, we can calculate this as follows:

2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the second day.
We know that Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day. So, we just add this to the total from the first day:

24 pieces (first day) + 10 pieces (second day) = 34 pi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- The pizza has 60 pieces in total.
- On the first day, Tobias ate 2/5 of the pieces.
- On the second day, Tobias ate 10 pieces.
- On the third day, Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
2/5 of 60 pieces = (2 × 60) ÷ 5 = 120 ÷ 5 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces remaining after the first day.
