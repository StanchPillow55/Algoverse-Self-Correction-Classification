=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla after giving a total of 52 marbles to both Dallas and Darla.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Mazie has a total of 52 marbles.
   - After giving some marbles to Dallas, he ends up with 21 marbles, but this includes 4 marbles that he dropped.
   - We need to find out how many marbles Darla received.

2. **Finding out how many marbles Dallas originally had**:
   - Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can calculate how many he had before dropping them.
   - We add the 4 marbles he dropped to the 21 marbles he currently has:
     \[
     \text{Marbles Dallas originally had} = 21 + 4 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculating how many marbles Darla received**:
   - Since Mazie gave away a total of 52 marbles, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas originally had from the total number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 52 - \text{Marbles Dallas originally had}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 52 - 25 = 27
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Mazie gave Darla a total of 27 marbles.

Thus, the final answer is that Mazie gave **27 marbles** to Darla.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Mazie has 52 marbles in total
* She gives all marbles to Dallas and Darla
* Dallas has 21 marbles AFTER dropping 4 marbles
* We need to find how many Darla received

2. Let's find how many marbles Dallas originally received:
* Current marbles = 21
* Lost marbles = 4
* Original marbles = Current + Lost
* Original marbles = 21 + 4 = 25 marbles

3. Now we can find D...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many marbles Dallas originally received from Mazie before he dropped some. Since we know Dallas dropped 4 marbles and now has 21, we can add these two amounts together to find the original amount. 

21 marbles + 4 marbles = 25 marbles

So, Dallas originally received 25 marbles from Mazie.

Next, to find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had.

52...
