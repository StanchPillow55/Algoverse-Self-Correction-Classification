=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.

2. **Likes After Three Weeks**: According to the problem, three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. We can calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \text{Likes after three weeks} = 70 \times \text{Initial Likes} = 70 \times 2000
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   70 \times 2000 = 140000
   \]

   So, after three weeks, Fishio had 140,000 likes on her photo.

3. **New Likes Received**: The problem states that she received 20,000 more new likes recently. We need to add these new likes to the total number of likes after three weeks:

   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = \text{Likes after three weeks} + \text{New Likes}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = 140000 + 20000
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   140000 + 20000 = 160000
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes on Fishio's selfie is:

   \[
   \boxed{160000}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.
- Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
- Fishio recently received 20,000 more new likes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks.
Initial number of likes = 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 × 2000 = 140,000 likes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of lik...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial likes after 1 week = 2000 likes

2. Three weeks later:
* The likes became 70 times the initial likes
* Number of likes = 2000 × 70
* Number of likes = 140,000 likes

3. Recently received additional likes:
* New likes = 20,000

4. Total current likes:
* Total = Likes after three weeks + New likes
* Total = 140,000 + 20,000
* Total = 160,000 likes

Therefore, Fishio's Instagram photo currently has 160,000 l...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week. 

Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. So, we multiply the initial number of likes by 70 to find out how many likes she had after three weeks:

2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes

So, after three weeks, she had 140,000 likes on her photo.

Recently, she received 20,000 more new likes. To find out the total number of likes she has now, we add the new likes to...
