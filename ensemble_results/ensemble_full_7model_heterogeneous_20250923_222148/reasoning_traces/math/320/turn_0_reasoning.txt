=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial total number of people at the party.**
   - We start with 25 men and 15 women.
   - Total number of people = Number of men + Number of women
   \[
   \text{Total number of people} = 25 + 15 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate how many people left the party after an hour.**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total number of people left.
   \[
   \text{Number of people who left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine how many people stayed at the party.**
   - If 10 people left, then the number of people who stayed is:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who stayed} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of people who left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of people who stayed} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Identify how many men stayed at the party.**
   - We are given that 22 men stayed at the party.

5. **Calculate how many women stayed at the party.**
   - Since we know that 30 people stayed in total and 22 of them were men, we can find the number of women who stayed:
   \[
   \text{Number of women who stayed} = \text{Total number of people who stayed} - \text{Number of men who stayed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of women who stayed} = 30 - 22 = 8
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The number of women left at the party is 8.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women.
- After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left.
- 22 men stayed at the party.

Step 1: Find the total number of people at the beginning of the party.
Total people = Number of men + Number of women
Total people = 25 + 15 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who left the party.
Number of people who left = 1/4 of...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many women are left at the party after 1/4 of the total number of people have left, given that 22 men stayed.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the initial total number of people at the party:**

   - There are 25 men and 15 women at the beginning.
   - Total number of people = Number of men + Number of women

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of people at the start
* Men at start = 25
* Women at start = 15
* Total people at start = 25 + 15 = 40 people

2. Calculate how many people left after an hour
* 1/4 of total left
* 1/4 of 40 = 40 รท 4 = 10 people left

3. Calculate total people remaining
* Total remaining = Original total - People who left
* Total remaining = 40 - 10 = 30 people

4. We know 22 men stayed, so:
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of people at the beginning of the party is 25 men + 15 women = 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. So, 1/4 * 40 = 10 people left the party.

Since 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 25 men - 22 men = 3 men left the party.

If 3 out of the 10 people who left the party were men, then the remaining 10 people - 3 men = 7 people who left must have been women.

So, the number of women left at the party is the original num...
