=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, let's define the variables and work through the information step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - The first aquarium has 4 snails, and the second aquarium has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Snails**:
   - The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
     \[
     32 - 4 = 28
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails (which we calculated as 28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2x \).
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     28 = 2x
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Each aquarium has \( x = 14 \) fish.

Thus, the final answer is that there are **14 fish in each aquarium**.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of fish in each aquarium given the conditions provided.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium:**
   - Aquarium 1 has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium 2 has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:**
   \[
   \text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Understand the relationship between the difference in sn...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify the key information:
* First aquarium has 4 snails
* Second aquarium has 32 snails
* The difference in snails between aquariums is twice the total fish
* Both aquariums have equal number of fish

2) Find the difference in snails:
* Difference = 32 - 4 = 28 snails

3) Set up an equation:
* Let x = number of fish in each aquarium
* Total fish in both aquariums = x + x = 2x
* The difference in snails ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. 

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. 

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails.

So, we can set up the equation: 

2F = 28

To solve for F, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

F = 28 / 2 = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Aquarium 1 has 4 snails
   * Aquarium 2 has 32 snails
   * The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums
   * Both aquariums have the same number of fish

2. Calculate the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums:
   * Difference = Snails in Aquarium 2 - Snails in Aquarium ...
