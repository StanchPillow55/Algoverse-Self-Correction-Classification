Final Answer: To determine how much money was withheld from Sally's wage, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the bank account**: 
   - At the start of the week, Sally had $200 in her bank account.

2. **Identify the final amount in the bank account**: 
   - At the end of the week, her bank account shows $420.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money that has gone into her bank account this week**:
   - The change in her bank account balance can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Change in balance} = \text{Final balance} - \text{Initial balance}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Change in balance} = 420 - 200 = 220
   \]
   This means that $220 has been deposited into her bank account this week.

4. **Identify Sally's expected weekly wage**:
   - Sally's expected weekly wage is $300.

5. **Determine how much of her wage was actually deposited**:
   - Since Sally received no other money, the amount that should have been deposited (her wage) is $300. However, only $220 was deposited.

6. **Calculate the amount withheld from her wage**:
   - The amount withheld can be calculated by subtracting the amount deposited from her expected wage:
   \[
   \text{Amount withheld} = \text{Expected wage} - \text{Amount deposited}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Amount withheld} = 300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Thus, the amount withheld from Sally's wage is **$80**.

Final answer: **$80**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify the key information:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account and now has $420. This means that she received $420 - $200 = $220 this week.

However, Sally's weekly wage should be $300. If she only received $220, then $300 - $220 = $80 were withheld from Sally's wage.

So, $80 were withheld from Sally's wage.
