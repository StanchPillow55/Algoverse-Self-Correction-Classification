=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many minutes Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to calculate the total amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined.

1. **Calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday:**
   - Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
   - Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes

   We add these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the exercise time for Tuesday:**
   Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined. Therefore, we need to multiply the total time by 2:
   \[
   \text{Time for Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Total time on Sunday and Monday} = 2 \times 39 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Now we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Peter needs to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to meet his goal.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Tuesday, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Monday and Sunday combined.
- On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes.
- On Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the total time Peter exercised on Monday and Sunday.
Time exercised on Monday = 16 minutes
Time exercised on Sunday = 23 minutes
Total time exercised on Monday and Sunday = 16 minutes +...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Peter should exercise on Tuesday based on his exercise times on Sunday and Monday.

1. **Identify the exercise times for Sunday and Monday:**
   - On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.
   - On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.

2. **Calculate the total exercise time for Sunday and Monday combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total minutes on Sunday and Monday} = 23 \text{ minutes} + 16 \text{ minutes} = 39 \tex...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Sunday exercise time = 23 minutes
* Monday exercise time = 16 minutes
* Tuesday's goal = 2 × (Sunday + Monday)

2. Let's find Sunday + Monday exercise time:
* Sunday + Monday = 23 + 16
* Sunday + Monday = 39 minutes

3. Now to find Tuesday's goal, multiply by 2:
* Tuesday = 2 × 39
* Tuesday = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach hi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many minutes Peter exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday, he exercised for 16 minutes. 

So, the total time he exercised on both days is 23 minutes + 16 minutes = 39 minutes.

Peter wants to exercise on Tuesday for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined. 

So, to find out how many minutes he has to exercise on Tuesday, we multiply the total...
