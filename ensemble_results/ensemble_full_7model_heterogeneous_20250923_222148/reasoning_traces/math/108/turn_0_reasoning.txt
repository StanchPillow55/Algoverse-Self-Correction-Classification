=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year. According to the problem, he wants to bake twice as many cookies this year, so he intended to bake:

\[
2x
\]

However, he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended. Therefore, the total number of cookies he actually baked is:

\[
2x + 15
\]

Next, he dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool. Thus, the number of cookies he has left after dropping them is:

\[
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
\]

We know from the problem statement that after all of this, Henry has a total of 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
2x + 10 = 110
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[
2x + 10 - 10 = 110 - 10
\]
\[
2x = 100
\]

2. Divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{100}{2}
\]
\[
x = 50
\]

Thus, the number of cookies Henry baked last year is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

To verify, we can check the calculations:

- Last year, Henry baked \( 50 \) cookies.
- This year, he intended to bake \( 2 \times 50 = 100 \) cookies.
- He actually baked \( 100 + 15 = 115 \) cookies.
- After dropping 5 cookies, he has \( 115 - 5 = 110 \) cookies left.

Since all calculations check out, the final answer is indeed:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final number of cookies Henry has to determine how many cookies he baked last year.

Given information:
- Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
- He baked 15 more cookies than he meant to.
- He dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool.
- He now has a total of 110 cookies.

Step 1: Determine the number of cookies Henry meant to bake.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Henry baked last year. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year. Therefore, he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
   - However, he ends up baking 15 more cookies than he planned. So, the actual number of cookies he baked is \( 2...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's work backwards from what we know:
* Henry currently has 110 cookies after dropping 5
* Before dropping the cookies, he had:
  * 110 + 5 = 115 cookies

2. We know he baked 15 more than he meant to
* So his intended amount was:
  * 115 - 15 = 100 cookies

3. We know he wanted to make twice as many as last year
* So if we let x = number of cookies from last year:
  * 2x = 100
  * x = 100 รท 2
  * x = 50

Let's ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. 

According to the problem, Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which would be 2x. 

However, he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he intended to, so the number of cookies he actually baked is 2x + 15. 

After dropping 5 cookies, he was left with 110 cookies. This means that before dropping the cookies, he had 110 + 5 = 115 cookies.

We can now set up the equation 2x + 15 = 11...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the important information given in the problem.

Given:
- Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.
- He accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he intended.
- He dropped 5 cookies while putting them out to cool.
- After dropping the 5 cookies, he now has a total of 110 cookies.

Step 1: Let's express the number of cookies Henry intended to bake this year in te...
