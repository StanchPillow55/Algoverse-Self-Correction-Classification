=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after purchasing the computer and its accessories, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total budget**: Elvira has a total budget of €1500.

2. **List the costs of the items she wants to buy**:
   - Computer: €1090
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD burner: €74
   - Printer: €102

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items**:
   We will add the costs of the computer, scanner, CD burner, and printer together.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Computer} + \text{Cost of Scanner} + \text{Cost of CD Burner} + \text{Cost of Printer}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add the cost of the computer and the scanner:
     \[
     1090 + 157 = 1247
     \]

   - Next, add the cost of the CD burner:
     \[
     1247 + 74 = 1321
     \]

   - Finally, add the cost of the printer:
     \[
     1321 + 102 = 1423
     \]

   So, the total cost of all items is €1423.

4. **Calculate the remaining money**:
   To find out how much money Elvira has left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her total budget.

   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = \text{Total Budget} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Remaining Money} = 1500 - 1423
   \]

   Now, perform the subtraction:

   \[
   1500 - 1423 = 77
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

Thus, the final answer is **€77**.
