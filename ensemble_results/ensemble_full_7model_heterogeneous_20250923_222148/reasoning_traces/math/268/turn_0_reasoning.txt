Final Answer: To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for both the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum those costs.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of newspaper ads.**

The cost of each newspaper ad is $5, and the agent bought 50 newspaper ads. 

To find the total cost for the newspaper ads, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for newspaper ads} = 250
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of television ads.**

The cost of each television ad is $75, and the agent bought 15 television ads.

Using the same formula for the total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost for television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for television ads} = 15 \times 75
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for television ads} = 1125
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all ads.**

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads:

\[
\text{Total cost for all ads} = \text{Total cost for newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost for television ads}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost for all ads} = 250 + 1125
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for all ads} = 1375
\]

**Final Answer:**

The real estate agent spent a total of **$1375** on buying all the ads.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 of them. So, the total cost for newspaper ads is $5 * 50 = $<<5*50=250>>250.

Similarly, he spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 of them. So, the total cost for television ads is $75 * 15 = $<<75*15=1125>>1125.

To find the total amount spent on all ads, we add the cost of the newspaper ads to the cost of the television ads. So, $250 + $1125 = $<<250+1125=1375>>1375.
