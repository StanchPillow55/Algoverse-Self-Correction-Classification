=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up from the three different boxed sets.

1. **Identify the number of pieces in each set:**
   - The first boxed set has **500 pieces**.
   - The second boxed set has **3 times more pieces** than the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - The third boxed set has **1/4 the number of pieces** of the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   Now we add the number of pieces from all three sets together:
   \[
   500 + 1500 + 125
   \]

   We can perform the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add the first two sets:
     \[
     500 + 1500 = 2000
     \]
   - Now, add the third set:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up is:
   \[
   \boxed{2125}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Johnny has a lego boxed set with 500 pieces.
- He has another lego boxed set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one.
- He has another lego boxed set that has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece one.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the second lego boxed set = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the n...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of lego pieces Johnny picks up from the floor. We are given information about three different lego sets:

1. The first lego set has 500 pieces.
2. The second lego set has 3 times more pieces than the first set.
3. The third lego set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set.

Let's calculate the number of pieces in each set and then find the total.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the different sets of legos:
   * First set: 500 pieces
   * Second set: 3 times more than 500 pieces
   * Third set: 1/4 of 500 pieces

2. Let's calculate the second set:
   * Second set = 500 × 3
   * Second set = 1,500 pieces

3. Let's calculate the third set:
   * Third set = 500 × (1/4)
   * Third set = 500 ÷ 4
   * Third set = 125 pieces

4. Now let's add all sets together:
   * Total ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's identify the number of pieces in each lego set.

The first set has 500 pieces.

The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. To find out how many pieces this set has, we multiply the number of pieces in the first set by 3:

500 pieces * 3 = 1500 pieces

The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first set. To find out how many pieces this set has, we divide the number of pieces in the first set by 4:

500 pieces / 4 = 125 pieces

Now, to ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- One Lego set has 500 pieces.
- Another set has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second set (3 times more than 500).
Second set pieces = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the third set (1/4 of 500).
Third set pieces = 1/4 × 500 ...
