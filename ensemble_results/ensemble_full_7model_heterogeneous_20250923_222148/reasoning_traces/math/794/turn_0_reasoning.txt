=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to account for the female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

1. **Count the female lions**: 
   The problem states that there are 12 female lions.

   \[
   \text{Number of female lions} = 12
   \]

2. **Count the male lions**: 
   The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the lion cubs**: 
   The problem states that there are 14 lion cubs.

   \[
   \text{Number of lion cubs} = 14
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of lions**: 
   To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:

   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of lion cubs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   12 + 6 = 18
   \]
   \[
   18 + 14 = 32
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of lions in the enclosure is 

   \[
   \boxed{32}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 12 female lions
- There are half as many male lions as female lions
- There are 14 lion cubs

Step 1: Calculate the number of male lions.
Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, we can calculate the number of male lions as follows:
Number of male lions = 1/2 × Number of female lions
Number of male lions = 1/2 × 12 = 6 male lions

Step 2: Calculate the total numb...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how many lions are in the enclosure, we need to consider the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs separately, and then sum them up.

1. **Count the Female Lions:**
   - The problem states that there are 12 female lions.

2. **Count the Male Lions:**
   - The problem states that there are half as many male lions as there are female lions.
   - Since there are 12 female lions, the number of male lions is half of 12.
   - Cal...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem tells us that there are 12 female lions and half as many male lions. To find out how many male lions there are, we need to divide the number of female lions by 2:

12 female lions ÷ 2 = 6 male lions

Next, the problem tells us that there are 14 lion cubs. To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs:

12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 12 female lions in the enclosure.
   * The number of male lions is half the number of female lions.
   * There are 14 lion cubs in the enclosure.

2. Calculate the number of male lions:
   * The number of male lions is half the number of female lions.
   * Number of female lions = 12
   * Number of male lions = 12 ÷ 2 = 6

3. Add up the total number of lions:...
