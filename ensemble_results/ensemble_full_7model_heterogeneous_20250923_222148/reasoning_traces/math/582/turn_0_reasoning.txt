=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of Juan's house based on the information provided about Herb's house, and then calculate the combined value of both houses.

1. **Determine the value of Herb's house:**
   Herb paid $76,000 for his house. Therefore, the value of Herb's house is:
   \[
   \text{Value of Herb's house} = 76,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house:**
   Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of the value of Herb's house:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of Herb's house} = 0.30 \times 76,000
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
   \]
   This means Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house:
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800
   \]
   Now, we perform the subtraction:
   \[
   76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
   \]
   Thus, the value of Juan's house is:
   \[
   \text{Value of Juan's house} = 53,200
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined value of both houses:**
   Now that we have the values of both houses, we can find the combined value:
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = \text{Value of Herb's house} + \text{Value of Juan's house}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is:
   \[
   \boxed{129,200}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Herb's house cost $76,000.
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of Juan's house.
Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house, we can calculate the cost of Juan's house as follows:
Cost of Juan's house = Cost of Herb's house - (Cost of Herb's house × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house = $76,000 - ($76,000 × 0.30)
Cost of Juan's house...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of Juan's house and then add it to the value of Herb's house to find the combined value of both houses.

### Step 1: Determine the value of Herb's house
Herb's house is valued at $76,000.

### Step 2: Calculate the value of Juan's house
Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and then subtract that from Herb's house value.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Herb's house cost $76,000
* Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's
* We need to find the combined value of both houses

2. To find Juan's house value:
* 30% less means we subtract 30% from Herb's house value
* 30% = 0.30
* Juan's house = Herb's house - (30% × Herb's house)
* Juan's house = $76,000 - (0.30 × $76,000)
* Juan's house = $76,000 - $22,800
* Juan's house = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. Since we know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can calculate the value of Juan's house by finding 30% of Herb's house price and then subtracting that from Herb's house price.

30% of $76,000 is calculated as follows:

0.30 * $76,000 = $22,800

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's. To find out how much Juan's house is worth, we subtract this amount from the price of Herb's h...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Herb paid $76,000 for his house.
- Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's.

Step 1: Calculate the value of Juan's house.
To find the value of Juan's house, we need to subtract 30% from the value of Herb's house.

30% of Herb's house value = 0.30 × $76,000 = $22,800

Juan's house value = Herb's house value - 30% of Herb's house value
Juan's house value = $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,2...
