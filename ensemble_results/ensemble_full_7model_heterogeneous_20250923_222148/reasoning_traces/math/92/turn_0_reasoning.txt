=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the ages of each child based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Define the ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
   - According to the problem, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age can be expressed as:
     \[
     A = J + 5
     \]
   - It is also stated that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Therefore, we can express Corey's age as:
     \[
     C = A + 2
     \]
   - We know that James is 10 years old, and he is 1 year younger than Corey. Thus, we can express Corey's age in terms of James's age:
     \[
     C = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

2. **Substituting Corey's age:**
   - Now we have Corey's age \( C = 11 \). We can substitute this value into the equation for Corey's age:
     \[
     C = A + 2 \implies 11 = A + 2
     \]
   - Solving for \( A \):
     \[
     A = 11 - 2 = 9
     \]

3. **Finding Jackson's age:**
   - Now that we have Amy's age \( A = 9 \), we can substitute this back into the equation for Amy's age in terms of Jackson's age:
     \[
     A = J + 5 \implies 9 = J + 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( J \):
     \[
     J = 9 - 5 = 4
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - We have determined that Jackson's age is \( J = 4 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define the ages of each child based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Define the ages:**
   - Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
   - According to the problem, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, so Amy's age can be expressed as:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emily has 4 kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
- Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
- Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
- James is 10 years old.
- James is 1 year younger than Corey.

Step 1: Find Corey's age.
Since James is 1 year younger than Corey, and James is 10 years old, we can calculate Corey's age:
Corey's age = James' age + 1
Corey's age = 10 + 1 = 11 years old

Step 2: Find...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each of Emily's children based on the relationships described in the problem.

Let's define the ages of the children using variables:
- Let \( J \) be the age of Jackson.
- Let \( A \) be the age of Amy.
- Let \( C \) be the age of Corey.
- Let \( Jm \) be the age of James.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson: \( A = J + 5 \).
2. Amy is 2 years younger than Cor...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* James is 10 years old
* James is 1 year younger than Corey
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson

2. Let's find Corey's age:
* If James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey
* Then Corey is 11 years old (10 + 1 = 11)

3. Now let's find Amy's age:
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey
* Corey is 11
* So Amy is 9 years old (11 - 2 = 9)

4. Finally, w...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out the ages of each child based on the information given in the problem.

We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey. This means that Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

We also know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. So, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Finally, we know that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. So, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's organize the information we have:
* Emily has 4 kids: Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James.
* James is 10 years old.
* James is 1 year younger than Corey.
* Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
* Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.

Now, let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: Determine Corey's age.
* We know that James is 1 year younger than Corey.
* James is 10 years old.
* So, Corey must be 1 year older than James.
Corey's age = James' age...
