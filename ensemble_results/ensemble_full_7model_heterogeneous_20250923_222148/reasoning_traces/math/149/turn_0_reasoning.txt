=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of Facebook friends that Charlie, Dorothy, and James have.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( D \) represent the number of friends Dorothy has.
   - Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express Charlie's friends as \( C = 3D \).
   - James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express James's friends as \( J = 4D \).

2. **Use the information given**:
   - We know from the problem that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   C = 12
   \]
   Substituting the expression for Charlie's friends:
   \[
   3D = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( D \)**:
   To find the number of friends Dorothy has, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

4. **Calculate James's friends**:
   Now that we know \( D \), we can find the number of friends James has using the expression for James's friends:
   \[
   J = 4D
   \]
   Substituting \( D = 4 \):
   \[
   J = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.

Step 1: Find the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, we can use the following equation:
Charlie's friends = 3 × Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 × Dorothy's friends
Doroth...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has, given the relationships between the number of friends Charlie, Dorothy, and James have.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
2. James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
3. Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.

We need to find out how many friends James has.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Charlie has 12 Facebook friends
* Charlie has 3 times as many friends as Dorothy
* James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy

2. Let's find Dorothy's number of friends:
* If Charlie has 3 times Dorothy's friends and Charlie has 12 friends
* Then: Dorothy's friends × 3 = 12
* Dorothy's friends = 12 ÷ 3 = 4
* So Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends

3. Now we can find James's frie...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

3D = 12

To solve for D (Dorothy's number of friends), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

Next, we need to determine how many Facebook friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, and Dorothy has 4 ...
