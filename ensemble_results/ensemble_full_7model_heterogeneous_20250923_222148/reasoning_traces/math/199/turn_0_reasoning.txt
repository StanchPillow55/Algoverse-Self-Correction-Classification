Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payment rates:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Therefore, the number of sentences edited for each publisher is:
     \[
     \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000 \text{ sentences}}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from each publisher:**
   - **Earnings from Publisher A:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - **Earnings from Publisher B:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Number of sentences} \times \text{Payment per sentence} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - To find the total earnings, we add the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Mark edits the same number of sentences for each publisher
* Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays
* Total sentences = 1000
* Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence
* Publisher B pays 2 ร 5 = 10 cents per sentence

2. Since Mark edits equal numbers for each publisher:
* Sentences for Publisher A = 1000 รท 2 = 500 sentences
* Sentences for Publisher B = 1000 รท 2 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 1000 / 2 = <<1000/2=500>>500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, so Mark makes 500 * 5 = <<500*5=2500>>2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays Mark 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 cents per sentence.

So, Mark makes 500 * 10 = <<500*10=5000>>5000 cents from Publisher B.

Therefore, in total, Mark makes 2500 + 5000...
