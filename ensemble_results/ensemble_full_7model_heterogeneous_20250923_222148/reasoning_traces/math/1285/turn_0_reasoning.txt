Final Answer: To determine how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of meals Mamou started with**: 
   - Mamou has a total of 1,360 meals.

2. **Calculate the total number of meals distributed over the weekend**:
   - On Friday, Mamou distributed 64 meals.
   - On Saturday, she distributed 30 meals.
   - On Sunday, she distributed 48 meals.

3. **Add the meals distributed each day**:
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = \text{Meals on Friday} + \text{Meals on Saturday} + \text{Meals on Sunday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total meals distributed} = 64 + 30 + 48
   \]

4. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add Friday and Saturday:
   \[
   64 + 30 = 94
   \]
   - Next, add the result to the meals distributed on Sunday:
   \[
   94 + 48 = 142
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining meals**:
   - To find out how many meals Mamou has left, subtract the total meals distributed from the initial total:
   \[
   \text{Meals left} = \text{Total meals} - \text{Total meals distributed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Meals left} = 1360 - 142
   \]

6. **Perform the subtraction**:
   \[
   1360 - 142 = 1218
   \]

Thus, the number of meals Mamou has left to distribute is **1218**.

Final Answer: **1218 meals**.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already given out from the total number of meals she started with.

First, let's add up the number of meals she has already given out:

64 meals on Friday + 30 meals on Saturday + 48 meals on Sunday = 142 meals

Now, let's subtract this from the total number of meals she started with:

1,360 meals - 142 meals = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.

     - Friday: 64 meals
     - Saturday: 30 meals
     - Sunday: 48 meals

2. Calculate the total number of meals Mamou distributed over the three days:
   * Total meals distributed = Friday meals + Saturday meals + Sunday meals
   * Total meals distributed = 64 + 30 + 48
