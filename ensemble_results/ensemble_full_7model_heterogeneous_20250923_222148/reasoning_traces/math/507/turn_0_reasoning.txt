=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass instead of paying for individual bus trips, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of individual bus trips for one week:**
   - Janet takes two bus trips each day for five days a week.
   - The cost of each bus trip is $2.20.

   First, we calculate the total number of bus trips she takes in a week:
   \[
   \text{Total bus trips} = \text{Number of trips per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ trips}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total cost for these trips:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of bus trips} = \text{Total bus trips} \times \text{Cost per trip} = 10 \times 2.20 = 22.00
   \]

2. **Compare the cost of individual trips to the cost of the weekly bus pass:**
   - The cost of the weekly bus pass is $20.

3. **Calculate the savings:**
   - To find out how much Janet saves by purchasing the weekly bus pass, we subtract the cost of the weekly pass from the total cost of individual trips:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Total cost of bus trips} - \text{Cost of weekly bus pass} = 22.00 - 20.00 = 2.00
   \]

Thus, Janet would save **$2.00** by buying the weekly bus pass instead of paying for individual bus trips.

**Final Answer: $2.00**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass and then compare it to the cost of the weekly pass to determine the savings.

Given information:
- Janet takes two bus trips five days a week.
- Each bus trip costs $2.20.
- The weekly bus pass costs $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of Janet's bus trips without a weekly pass.
Cost per day = 2 bus trips × $2.20 per trip = $4.40
Cost per week = $4...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Janet's weekly cost for bus trips without a pass and compare it to the cost of a weekly bus pass. Then, we can determine how much she would save by purchasing the pass.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the number of bus trips Janet takes in a week:**
   - Janet takes two bus trips per day.
   - She takes these trips five days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of bus trips per week is:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Calculate how many bus trips Janet takes per week:
* 2 trips per day × 5 days = 10 trips per week

2. Calculate the total cost of individual bus trips per week:
* Cost per trip = $2.20
* Total cost = $2.20 × 10 trips
* Total cost = $22.00

3. Compare weekly pass cost vs. individual trip cost:
* Individual trips cost: $22.00
* Weekly pass cost: $20.00
* Savings = Individual trips cost - Weekly pass cost
* Savings ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each day. Since each trip costs $2.20 and she takes two trips a day, she spends 2.20 * 2 = $4.40 per day.

Next, we need to calculate how much she spends in a week. Since she takes the bus five days a week, she spends 4.40 * 5 = $22.00 per week.

Finally, we need to calculate how much she would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.00. Since she currently spends $22.00 per week and the pass costs $20.00, sh...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Janet takes two bus trips per day, five days a week.
   * Each bus trip costs $2.20.
   * A weekly bus pass costs $20.

2. Calculate the total number of bus trips Janet takes in a week:
   * Bus trips per day = 2
   * Days per week = 5
   * Total bus trips per week = Bus trips per day × Days per week
   * Total bus trips per week = 2 × 5 = 10

3. Calculate the total co...
