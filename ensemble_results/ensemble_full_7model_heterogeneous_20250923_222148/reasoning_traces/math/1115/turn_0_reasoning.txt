=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Anna's remaining budget after her initial spending**:
   - Anna had a budget of $16.
   - She spent $4.
   - Therefore, her remaining budget after spending $4 is:
     \[
     16 - 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much Anna has left after buying the books**:
   - Anna has $2 left in her budget after buying the books.
   - Thus, the amount she spent on the books is:
     \[
     12 - 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each book**:
   - Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount.
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of each book.
   - Since she bought 2 books, the total cost for the books can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x = 10
     \]
   - To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{10}{2} = 5
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Each book costs $5.

Thus, the final answer is that each of the books cost **$5**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Anna had a budget of $16.
- She has already spent $4.
- She bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount.
- She has $2 left in her budget.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Anna has spent so far.
Total amount spent = Amount already spent + Cost of the 2 books
Total amount spent = $4 + (2 Ã— cost of each book)

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Anna has left in her b...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each of the two books Anna bought cost, given the constraints of her budget.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial Budget**: Anna had a total budget of $16.
2. **Amount Already Spent**: She has already spent $4 from her budget.
3. **Books Purchased Today**: Anna bought 2 books today, and both books cost the same amount.
4. **Remaining Budget**: After buying the books, Anna has $2 left in her budget....

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Initial budget = $16
* Already spent = $4
* Bought 2 books (same price each)
* Money left = $2

2. Let's find how much money she had available for the 2 books:
* Money available = Initial budget - Already spent
* Money available = $16 - $4 = $12

3. Now we know:
* She spent this money on 2 books
* She has $2 left
* So the money she spent on books = Money availabl...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how much money Anna spent on books today. We know she started with a budget of $16 and has $2 left, so she must have spent $16 - $2 = $14 in total.

However, we also know that Anna spent $4 before she bought the books today. So, the amount of money she spent on the books today must be $14 (total spent) - $4 (spent before) = $10.

Since both books cost the same amount of money, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total cost of the ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Anna's total budget is $16.
   * She has already spent $4.
   * She bought 2 books today, both costing the same amount.
   * After buying the books, she has $2 left in her budget.

2. Calculate the remaining budget after Anna's initial spending:
   * Remaining budget = Total budget - Amount already spent
   * Remaining budget = $16 - $4
   * Remaining budget = $12
