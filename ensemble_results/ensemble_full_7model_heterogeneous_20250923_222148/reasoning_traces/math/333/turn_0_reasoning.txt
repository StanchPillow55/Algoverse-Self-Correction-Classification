Final Answer: To find the cost difference between the two offers from Furniture United and Cozy Homes, we need to calculate the total cost for each offer and then compare them.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for Furniture United's offer.

1. **Advance payment**: $1,350
2. **Monthly installments**: 6 installments of $350 each

   To find the total cost of the installments, we multiply the number of installments by the amount of each installment:
   \[
   \text{Total installments} = 6 \times 350 = 2,100
   \]

3. **Total cost for Furniture United**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + \text{Total installments}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1,350 + 2,100 = 3,450
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for Cozy Homes' offer.

1. **Advance payment**: $1,100
2. **Monthly installments**: 9 installments of $250 each

   To find the total cost of the installments, we multiply the number of installments by the amount of each installment:
   \[
   \text{Total installments} = 9 \times 250 = 2,250
   \]

3. **Total cost for Cozy Homes**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Advance payment} + \text{Total installments}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1,100 + 2,250 = 3,350
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost difference between the two offers.

Now that we have the total costs for both offers, we can find the difference:
\[
\text{Cost difference} = \text{Total cost for Furniture United} - \text{Total cost for Cozy Homes}
\]
\[
\text{Cost difference} = 3,450 - 3,350 = 100
\]

### Final Answer:
The cost difference between the two offers is **$100**.
