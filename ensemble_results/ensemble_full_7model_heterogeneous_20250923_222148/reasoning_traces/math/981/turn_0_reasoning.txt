=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amount of crawfish Joe caught each day and then determining how many servings that amount corresponds to.

1. **Amount caught on Thursday**: 
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.

   \[
   \text{Thursday's catch} = 3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Amount caught on Friday**: 
   Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday on Friday. 

   \[
   \text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times \text{Thursday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Amount caught on Saturday**: 
   Joe caught half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday.

   \[
   \text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Friday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total amount of crawfish caught**: 
   Now, we will add up the amounts caught on each day to find the total amount of crawfish Joe has.

   \[
   \text{Total catch} = \text{Thursday's catch} + \text{Friday's catch} + \text{Saturday's catch}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total catch} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculating servings**: 
   Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings Joe has, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving.

   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total catch}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Thus, Joe has a total of 7 servings of crawfish.

**Final Answer**: Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many pounds Joe caught each day:
   * Thursday: 3 pounds
   * Friday: 4 × 3 = 12 pounds
   * Saturday: 12 ÷ 2 = 6 pounds

2. Now let's add up the total pounds:
   * Total = Thursday + Friday + Saturday
   * Total = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds

3. To find the number of servings:
   * 1 serving = 3 pounds
   * Number of servings = Total pounds ÷ Pounds per serving
   * Number of servings = 21 ÷ 3 =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught on Friday. Since he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday, we multiply Thursday's catch by 4:

3 pounds * 4 = 12 pounds

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of crawfish Joe caught on Saturday. Since he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, we divide Friday's catch by 2:

12 pounds / 2 = 6 pounds

Now, we add up all the pounds of crawfish Joe caught over the three days:

3 pounds (Thurs...
