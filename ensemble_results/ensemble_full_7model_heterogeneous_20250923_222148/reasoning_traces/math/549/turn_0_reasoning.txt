=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - James has 80 toys.
   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.

2. **Calculating the size of Jonathan's desired play set**:
   - Since James has 80 toys, five times the size of James's play set would be:
     \[
     5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach 400 toys. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + 2 = 400
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x = 400 - 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 398
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Jonathan currently has \( 398 \) toys.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{398}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of toys Jonathan currently has.

Given information:
- Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set.
- James's play set has 80 toys.

Step 1: Find the number of toys needed for Jonathan's play set.
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × Size of James's play set
Size of Jonathan's play set = 5 × 80 = 400 toys

Step 2: Find...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information given.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - James has a play set with 80 toys.
   - Jonathan wants a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to achieve this.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) be the number of toys Jonathan current...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* James has 80 toys in his play set
* Jonathan wants a play set 5 times larger than James's
* Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this goal

2. Calculate how many toys Jonathan needs in total:
* James's play set = 80 toys
* Jonathan wants 5 times more
* 80 × 5 = 400 toys needed

3. Find Jonathan's current toys:
* Jonathan needs 2 more toys to reach 400
* S...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many toys are in a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. 

Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would contain 80 * 5 = 400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this total. Therefore, to find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we subtract these 2 extra toys from the total of 400. 

So, Jonathan currently has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.

Therefore...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James's play set has 80 toys.
   * Jonathan needs a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.
   * Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to achieve this.

2. Calculate the number of toys Jonathan needs for his play set:
   * Jonathan's play set size = James's play set size × 5
   * Jonathan's play set size = 80 × 5
   * Jonathan's play set...
