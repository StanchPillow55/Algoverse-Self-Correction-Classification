=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of bolts of fiber required to make a robe, given the amounts of blue and white fiber needed.

1. **Identify the amount of blue fiber needed**:
   The problem states that a robe takes **2 bolts of blue fiber**.

2. **Identify the amount of white fiber needed**:
   The problem also states that the robe takes **half that much white fiber**. Since the amount of blue fiber is 2 bolts, we calculate the amount of white fiber as follows:
   \[
   \text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Blue fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt of white fiber}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of fiber**:
   To find the total number of bolts of fiber used, we add the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber together:
   \[
   \text{Total fiber} = \text{Blue fiber} + \text{White fiber} = 2 \text{ bolts} + 1 \text{ bolt} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of bolts of fiber required to make the robe is:
   \[
   \boxed{3}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- A robe takes half the amount of white fiber compared to blue fiber.

To find the total number of bolts required, we need to calculate the amount of blue fiber and the amount of white fiber, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of blue fiber.
Blue fiber required = 2 bolts

Step 2: Calculate the amount of white fiber.
White fibe...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* The robe needs 2 bolts of blue fiber
* The white fiber needed is half of the blue amount

2. Calculate the amount of white fiber needed:
* White fiber = 1/2 × blue fiber
* White fiber = 1/2 × 2 bolts
* White fiber = 1 bolt

3. Calculate total bolts needed:
* Total = Blue fiber + White fiber
* Total = 2 bolts + 1 bolt
* Total = 3 bolts

Final Answer: The robe takes 3 bolts of ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that a robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. 

First, let's determine how much white fiber is needed. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and the blue fiber is 2 bolts, we calculate:

2 bolts (blue fiber) / 2 = 1 bolt (white fiber)

Now, to find the total amount of fiber needed, we add the amount of blue fiber and white fiber together:

2 bolts (blue fiber) + 1 bolt (white fiber) = 3 bolts

So, it takes 3 bolts in total ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- A robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
- The robe also requires half the amount of white fiber compared to blue fiber.

Step 1: Determine the number of bolts of white fiber needed.
Since the robe requires half the amount of white fiber compared to blue fiber, we can calculate the number of bolts of white fiber as follows:

White fiber bolts = 1/2 × Blue fiber bolts
White fiber bolts = 1...
