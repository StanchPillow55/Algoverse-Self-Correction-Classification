=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much it will cost Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of legs for all dogs**: 
   Each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, for 6 dogs, the total number of legs is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Legs per dog} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed**:
   Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to find out how many pairs are required for 24 legs:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \frac{\text{Total legs}}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost for the snowshoes**:
   Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. Therefore, the total cost for 12 pairs is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 12 \times 12 = 144
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
   \[
   \boxed{144}
   \] 

Thus, Mario will need to spend $144.00 to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mario has 6 sled dogs
- Each sled dog has 4 legs
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00

To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the sled dogs
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
3. Multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the sled dogs

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many snowshoes Mario needs to buy for his 6 sled dogs and then calculate the total cost based on the price per pair of snowshoes.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of legs for each dog:**
   Each dog has 4 legs.

2. **Calculate the total number of legs for all dogs:**
   Mario has 6 dogs, and each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs is:
   \[
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs per do...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many total dog legs need snowshoes:
   * 6 dogs × 4 legs per dog = 24 legs total

2. Since snowshoes come in pairs, let's find how many pairs we need:
   * 24 legs ÷ 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes needed

3. Now we can calculate the total cost:
   * Each pair costs $12.00
   * 12 pairs × $12.00 per pair = $144.00

Reasoning:
* Each dog has 4 legs that need snowshoes
* Snowshoes are sold in pa...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs, and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, each dog will need two pairs of snowshoes. 

So, for one dog, the number of pairs of snowshoes needed is 4 legs / 2 (since a pair covers two legs) = 2 pairs.

Since Mario has 6 dogs, the total number of pairs of snowshoes he needs to buy is 2 pairs/dog * 6 dogs = 12 pairs.

Now, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each pair of...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mario has 6 sled dogs.
   * Each dog has four legs.
   * Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

2. Calculate the total number of legs for all 6 dogs:
   * Number of legs per dog = 4
   * Total number of dogs = 6
   * Total number of legs = Number of legs per dog × Total number of dogs
   * Total number of legs = 4 × 6 = 24 legs

3. Calculate the number of snowshoe pairs...
