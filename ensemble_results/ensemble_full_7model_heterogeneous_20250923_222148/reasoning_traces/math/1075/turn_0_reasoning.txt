=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the roses

Jenny buys 15 roses. The cost of roses is given as:
- $2 per rose
- $15 for a dozen (12 roses)

First, we calculate the cost of 12 roses:
\[
\text{Cost of 12 roses} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we need to find the cost of the remaining 3 roses (since 15 - 12 = 3):
\[
\text{Cost of 3 roses} = 3 \text{ roses} \times 2 \text{ dollars/rose} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of the dozen roses and the cost of the additional 3 roses:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ dollars} + 6 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five 5 dollar bills:
\[
\text{Total money} = 5 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the change Jenny receives

Now we find out how much change Jenny will receive after her purchase:
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = 25 \text{ dollars} - 21 \text{ dollars} = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the change into quarters

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the change Jenny receives into quarters. The value of one quarter is $0.25.

To find out how many quarters are in 4 dollars, we perform the following calculation:
\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{\text{Total change}}{\text{Value of one quarter}} = \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars/quarter}} = 16 \text{ quarters}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen.
- Jenny bought 15 roses.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Jenny paid.
Jenny paid with five 5-dollar bills = 5 × $5 = $25

Step 3: Calculate the amount of...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of the Roses

Jenny buys 15 roses. The florist offers two pricing options:
- $2 per rose
- $15 per dozen (12 roses)

Since Jenny is buying 15 roses, we should consider the most cost-effective way to purchase them.

1. **Calculate the cost using the dozen price:**
   - A dozen (12 roses) costs $15.
   - For 15 roses, ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's determine the best way to buy 15 roses:
   * One dozen (12) roses costs $15
   * Individual roses cost $2 each
   * For 15 roses, she needs 1 dozen plus 3 individual roses
   * Cost = $15 (for dozen) + (3 × $2) = $15 + $6 = $21 total

2. Calculate how much money Jenny arrived with:
   * She has five $5 bills
   * Total money = 5 × $5 = $25

3. Calculate her change:
   * Change = Money brought - Cost
...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Jenny spent on roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15 and she bought 15 roses, she bought one dozen and three additional roses. 

The cost for the dozen roses is $15. 

The cost for the three additional roses is 3 roses * $2/rose = $6. 

So, the total cost for the roses is $15 + $6 = $21. 

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she had 5 bills * $5/bill = $25. 

Subtracting the cost of the roses from the amount she had gives $25 - $21 =...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Roses cost $2 each
- A dozen roses cost $15
- Jenny bought 15 roses
- She arrived with five $5 bills
- The florist only has quarters for change

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 15 roses.
Since a dozen (12) roses cost $15, we can find the cost of 15 roses using the per-rose price.
15 roses × $2 per rose = $30

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Jenny brought.
Jenny brought five $5 bills.
5 × ...
