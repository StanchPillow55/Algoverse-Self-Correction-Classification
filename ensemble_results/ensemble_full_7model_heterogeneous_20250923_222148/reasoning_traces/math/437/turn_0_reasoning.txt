=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sitti bought 34 oranges.
- Juris bought 22 oranges.
- They want to share the oranges equally with 6 other friends.

Step 1: Find the total number of oranges.
Total oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris' oranges
Total oranges = 34 + 22 = 56 oranges

Step 2: Find the total number of people who will share the oranges.
Total people = Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends
Total people = 2 + 6 = 8 people

Step 3: Divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find the number of oranges each person will get.
Oranges per person = Total oranges / Total people
Oranges per person = 56 / 8 = 7 oranges

Therefore, if Sitti and Juris decide to share the oranges equally with their 6 other friends, each person will get 7
