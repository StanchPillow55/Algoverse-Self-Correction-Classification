=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break down Howard's spending day by day and then calculate how much money he has left after all his expenditures.

1. **Monday's Spending:**
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Monday = $8.

2. **Tuesday's Spending:**
   - On Tuesday, Howard spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Tuesday = 2 × Amount spent on Monday = 2 × $8 = $16.

3. **Wednesday's Spending:**
   - On Wednesday, Howard spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.
   - Amount spent on Wednesday = 4 × Amount spent on Tuesday = 4 × $16 = $64.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - Now we will calculate the total amount Howard spent over the three days.
   - Total spending = Amount spent on Monday + Amount spent on Tuesday + Amount spent on Wednesday
   - Total spending = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

5. **Calculating Remaining Money:**
   - Howard originally had $100.
   - To find out how much money he has left after his spending, we subtract his total spending from his original amount.
   - Remaining money = Original amount - Total spending
   - Remaining money = $100 - $88 = $12.

Thus, after all his expenditures at the arcade, Howard has $12 left.

**Final Answer: Howard has $12 left.**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much Howard spent each day:

   Monday: $8

   Tuesday: 2 × Monday's amount
   * 2 × $8 = $16

   Wednesday: 4 × Tuesday's amount
   * 4 × $16 = $64

2. Now let's add up all the money he spent:
   * Monday: $8
   * Tuesday: $16
   * Wednesday: $64
   * Total spent = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88

3. To find money left:
   * Starting amount: $100
   * Amount spent: $88
   * Money left = $100 - $88...
