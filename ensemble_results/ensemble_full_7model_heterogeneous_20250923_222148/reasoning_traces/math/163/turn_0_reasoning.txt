=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total worth of all the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the costs of the toys:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.
   - We are given that one action figure costs $5.
   - The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

2. **Calculate the cost of the doll:**
   - Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the red cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars, and each costs $4. Therefore, the total cost for the red cars is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the action figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures, and each costs $5. Therefore, the total cost for the action figures is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of all toys:**
   - Now we can sum the costs of all the toys:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all toys} = \text{Total cost of red cars} + \text{Total cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of the doll}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all toys} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - The total worth of all the toys in the room is:
     \[
     \boxed{50} \text{ dollars}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll in the room.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
- One red car costs $4.
- The cost of an action figure is $5.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the doll.
Cost of the doll = Cost of 3 action figures
Cost of the doll = 3 × $5 = $15

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the red cars.
Cost of one red car = $4

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of all the toys in the room. We are given the following information:

1. There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and 1 doll.
2. One red car costs $4.
3. One action figure costs $5.
4. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the red cars.
- There are 5 red cars.
- Each red car costs $4.
- Therefore, the total cost of the red c...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* 5 red cars
* 3 action figures
* 1 doll
* 1 red car costs $4
* 1 action figure costs $5
* 1 doll costs as much as 3 action figures

2. Calculate the cost of all red cars:
* Cost of red cars = 5 cars × $4 per car
* Cost of red cars = $20

3. Calculate the cost of all action figures:
* Cost of action figures = 3 figures × $5 per figure
* Cost of action figures = $15

4. Calculate the c...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out the cost of all the action figures and red cars. 

The cost of one action figure is given as $5. Since there are 3 action figures, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

The cost of one red car is given as $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total cost of the red cars is 5 * $4 = $20.

Now, let's find out the cost of the doll. The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, the cos...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Great! Let's solve this problem step by step. To find out the total worth of all the toys, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then add them together.

Given:
- There are 5 red cars, 3 action figures, and a doll.
- One red car costs $4.
- An action figure costs $5.
- The doll costs as much as 3 action figures.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the red cars.
Total cost of red cars = Number of red cars × Cost per red car
Total cost o...
