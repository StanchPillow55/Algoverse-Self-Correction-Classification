=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score for all tests**: We will add up the scores from each of the 4 tests.
   - John's scores are:
     - Test 1: 100
     - Test 2: 100
     - Test 3: 100
     - Test 4: 80

   Now, we add these scores together:
   \[
   \text{Total Score} = 100 + 100 + 100 + 80
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add the first three scores:
     \[
     100 + 100 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - Next, add the score from the fourth test:
     \[
     300 + 80 = 380
     \]

   So, the total score across all 4 tests is:
   \[
   \text{Total Score} = 380
   \]

2. **Calculate the average score**: The average score is found by dividing the total score by the number of tests.
   - The number of tests is 4.
   - The formula for the average is:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Score}}{\text{Number of Tests}} = \frac{380}{4}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{380}{4} = 95
   \]

3. **State the final answer**: Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is:
\[
\boxed{95}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average score across the 4 tests.

Given information:
- John scored 100 on his first 3 tests.
- John scored 80 on his 4th test.

Step 1: Calculate the total score across the 4 tests.
Total score = (100 ร 3) + 80 = 380

Step 2: Calculate the average score across the 4 tests.
Average score = Total score / Number of tests
Average score = 380 / 4 = 95

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the scores**: 
   - John's scores on the first three tests are 100, 100, and 100.
   - His score on the fourth test is 80.

2. **Calculate the total sum of the scores**:
   - Add the scores of all four tests together:
     \[
     100 + 100 + 100 + 80
     \]

3. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add the scores of the first three tests:
     \[
     100 + 100 + 100 = 300
     ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * John had 4 tests total
   * First 3 tests: 100 each
   * Fourth test: 80

2) To find the average, we need to:
   * Add up all test scores
   * Divide by the number of tests

3) Let's add the scores:
   * First three tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
   * Plus fourth test: 300 + 80 = 380
   * Total sum = 380

4) Now divide by number of tests (4):
   * 380 รท 4 = 95

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find the average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up all the scores and then divide by the number of tests.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total for these three tests is 3 * 100 = 300.

He scored 80 on his 4th test.

So, the total score for all 4 tests is 300 (from the first 3 tests) + 80 (from the 4th test) = 380.

Now we divide this total by the number of tests, which is 4, to find the average score.

So, the average score is 380 / 4 = 95.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John took 4 tests in total.
   * He scored 100 on each of the first 3 tests.
   * He scored 80 on the 4th test.
   * We need to find his average score across all 4 tests.

2. Recall the formula for calculating the average:
   * Average = Sum of all values รท Number of values

3. Calculate the sum of John's scores:
   * Sum = Score1 + Score2 + Score3 + Score4
   * Sum = 10...
