=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has after considering the kittens they adopted and the kittens born to their house cats.

1. **Kittens Adopted**: The Doubtfire sisters adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter. 
   \[
   \text{Kittens adopted} = 7
   \]

2. **Kittens from Patchy**: According to the problem, Patchy, the first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, we calculate the number of kittens Patchy had as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times \text{Kittens adopted} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Kittens from Trixie**: The problem states that Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens. 
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Trixie} = 12
   \]

4. **Total Kittens**: Now, we can find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has by adding the kittens they adopted, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
   \[
   \text{Total Kittens} = \text{Kittens adopted} + \text{Kittens from Patchy} + \text{Kittens from Trixie}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   \[
   7 + 21 = 28
   \]
   \[
   28 + 12 = 40
   \]

Thus, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
\[
\text{Total Kittens} = 40
\]

**Final Answer**: The Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the number of kittens from each source:
   * Adopted kittens from shelter = 7
   * Patchy's kittens = 3 × adopted kittens = 3 × 7 = 21 kittens
   * Trixie's kittens = 12 kittens

2. Now let's add all kittens together:
   * Total kittens = Adopted + Patchy's + Trixie's
   * Total kittens = 7 + 21 + 12
   * Total kittens = 40

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens in total.
