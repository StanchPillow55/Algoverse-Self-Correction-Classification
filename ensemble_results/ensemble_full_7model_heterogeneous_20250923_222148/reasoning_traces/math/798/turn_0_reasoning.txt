=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first calculate Billy's hourly wage over time and then determine Sally's hourly wage. Finally, we will calculate how much more money Billy earns than Sally when both work 20 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate Billy's hourly wage over time

1. **Initial Wage**: Billy's starting wage is $10.00 per hour.
2. **After 2 months**: He receives a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New wage = Initial wage + Raise = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.
3. **On his first anniversary**: He receives another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New wage = Previous wage + Raise = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour.

### Step 2: Calculate Sally's hourly wage

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary.
- Billy's starting salary = $10.00 per hour.
- Sally's starting salary = Billy's starting salary + $0.50 = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour.

### Step 3: Calculate earnings for both Billy and Sally for 20 hours of work

1. **Billy's earnings for 20 hours**:
   - Since the problem does not specify which wage to use for Billy's earnings, we will assume he is earning his latest wage of $11.50 per hour.
   - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked = $11.50 × 20 = $230.00.

2. **Sally's earnings for 20 hours**:
   - Sally's hourly wage is $10.50.
   - Earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked = $10.50 × 20 = $210.00.

### Step 4: Calculate the difference in earnings

To find out how much more money Billy earns than Sally:
- Difference = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00.

### Final Answer

Billy earns **$20.00** more than Sally when both work 20 hours.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the hourly wages for both Billy and Sally, and then determine how much they each earn for working 20 hours. Finally, we'll find the difference between their earnings.

**Step 1: Calculate Billy's current hourly wage.**

- **Initial wage:** Billy was initially paid $10 per hour.
- **First raise:** After 2 months, Billy received a raise of $0.50 per hour. So, his new wage after the first raise is:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's track Billy's pay rate changes:
* Starting rate = $10.00/hour
* After 2 months = $10.50/hour (added $0.50)
* After 1 year = $11.50/hour (added $1.00)
* Current rate = $11.50/hour

2. Now let's determine Sally's pay rate:
* Sally's rate = Billy's starting rate + $0.50
* Sally's rate = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50/hour

3. Calculate how much Billy will earn in 20 hours:
* Billy's earnings = $11.50/hour × 20...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50, making his hourly rate $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00, making his hourly rate $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, which means she earns $10.50 per hour.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy will earn 20 * $11.50 = $230, and Sally will earn 20 * $10.50 = $210.

Therefore, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 ...
