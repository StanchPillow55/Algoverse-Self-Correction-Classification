=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some away.

1. **Identify the total number of marbles Dean has**: 
   Dean starts with 30 marbles.

2. **Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie**:
   Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his marbles to Jamie. We can calculate this by multiplying the total number of marbles by \( \frac{1}{5} \):
   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Donald**:
   Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles given away**:
   Now we add the marbles given to Jamie and Donald:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles given away} = \text{Marbles given to Jamie} + \text{Marbles given to Donald} = 6 + 10 = 16
   \]

5. **Calculate how many marbles Dean has left**:
   To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Marbles left} = \text{Total marbles} - \text{Total marbles given away} = 30 - 16 = 14
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Dean has **14 marbles left**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dean has 30 marbles.
- He gives 1/5 of his marbles to Jamie.
- He gives 10 marbles to Donald.

Step 1: Calculate how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie.
1/5 of 30 marbles = 30 รท 5 = 6 marbles

Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving 6 to Jamie.
Dean's remaining marbles = 30 - 6 = 24 marbles

Step 3: Calculate how many marbles Dean has left after giving 10 to Donald.
Dean's ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some away to Jamie and Donald.

1. **Determine the number of marbles given to Jamie:**

   Dean gives \(\frac{1}{5}\) of his marbles to Jamie. Dean initially has 30 marbles.

   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30
   \]

   Calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 30\):

   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

   So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Dean starts with 30 marbles
* He gives 1/5 of them to Jamie
* He gives 10 marbles to Donald

2. Let's calculate how many marbles Jamie gets:
* 1/5 of 30 marbles = 30 รท 5 = 6 marbles
* So Jamie gets 6 marbles

3. Now let's subtract Jamie's marbles:
* 30 - 6 = 24 marbles remaining

4. Then Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald
* 24 - 10 = 14 marbles remaining

Therefore:
* Starting a...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since he gives Jamie 1/5 of his marbles, we need to calculate 1/5 of 30. 

1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles

So, Dean gives Jamie 6 marbles. 

Next, we know that Dean gives Donald 10 marbles. 

To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the number of marbles he gave to Jamie and Donald from his original total. 

30 (original total) - 6 (given to Jamie) - 10 (given to Donald) = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 ma...
