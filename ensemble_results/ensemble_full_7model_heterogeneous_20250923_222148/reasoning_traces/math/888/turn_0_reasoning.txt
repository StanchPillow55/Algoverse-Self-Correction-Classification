=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cookies Lani has after eating some.**
2. **Calculate how many cookies are left to be distributed into jars.**
3. **Divide the remaining cookies equally among the jars.**

### Step 1: Calculate the remaining cookies after Lani eats some.

Lani baked a total of 55 cookies. She ate 5 cookies. We need to subtract the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining cookies} = 55 - 5 = 50
\]

### Step 2: Distribute the remaining cookies into jars.

Lani places the remaining 50 cookies equally into 5 jars. To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we will divide the total number of remaining cookies by the number of jars.

\[
\text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{\text{Remaining cookies}}{\text{Number of jars}}
\]
\[
\text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{50}{5} = 10
\]

### Final Answer

Each jar contains **10 cookies**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lani baked 55 cookies.
- She ate 5 cookies.
- She placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies remaining after Lani ate 5 cookies.
Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten = Remaining cookies
55 cookies - 5 cookies = 50 remaining cookies

Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.
Remaining cookies / Number of jars = Cookies per jar
50 co...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Lani placed into each jar after eating some of them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cookies:**
   Lani initially baked 55 cookies.

2. **Cookies Eaten by Lani:**
   Lani ate 5 cookies. Therefore, we need to subtract these 5 cookies from the total number of cookies she baked.

   \[
   55 \text{ cookies} - 5 \text{ cookies} = 50 \text{ cookies}
   \]

   After eating 5 cookies...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Lani started with 55 cookies
* She ate 5 cookies
* The remaining cookies were divided equally into 5 jars

2. Let's find how many cookies were left after Lani ate 5:
* Starting cookies = 55
* Cookies eaten = 5
* Remaining cookies = 55 - 5 = 50 cookies

3. Now we need to divide the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars:
* Cookies per jar = 50 รท 5 = 10 cookies

4. Let's verify ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cookies Lani had left after she ate 5. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

55 cookies - 5 cookies = 50 cookies

So, Lani had 50 cookies left.

Next, we need to find out how many cookies were in each jar. We do this by dividing the number of cookies she had left by the number of jars.

50 cookies รท 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar

So, there were 10 cookies in each jar.
