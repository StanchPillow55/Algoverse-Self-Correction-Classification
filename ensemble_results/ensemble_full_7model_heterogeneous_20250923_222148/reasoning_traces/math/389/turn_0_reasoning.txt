=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet while Dasha buys tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet for David:**
   - The ride bracelet costs $30.
   - Since David buys the bracelet, his total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of tickets for Dasha:**
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total number of tickets Dasha needs is:
     \[
     \text{Total tickets needed} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} = 18 \text{ tickets}
     \]
   - Each ticket costs $2, so the total cost for the tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for tickets} = 18 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings for David:**
   - Now we compare the costs:
     - David's cost: $30
     - Dasha's cost: $36
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying tickets like Dasha.

   - The ride bracelet costs $30.
   - Since David buys the bracelet, his total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for David and Dasha, and then find the difference between the cost for David with the ride bracelet and the cost for Dasha with individual ride tickets.

Given information:
- There are 9 rides at the carnival.
- Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket.
- A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides.

Step 1: Calculate the cost for Dasha to ride all 9 rides with individual ride ticke...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost of David using a ride bracelet to the cost of Dasha using ride tickets for all 9 rides.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost for David using a ride bracelet.**

David buys a ride bracelet for $30, which allows him to go on all 9 rides. Therefore, the total cost for David is simply the cost of the bracelet:

\[ \text{Cost for David} = \$30 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost for Dasha using ride tickets.**

Each ride costs 2 ride t...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much Dasha pays using tickets:
* Each ride needs 2 tickets
* Each ticket costs $2
* For 9 rides, Dasha needs: 9 rides × 2 tickets = 18 tickets
* Cost for Dasha: 18 tickets × $2 = $36

2. David buys the ride bracelet:
* Bracelet cost = $30
* Gets all 9 rides

3. To find David's savings:
* Savings = Dasha's cost - David's cost
* Savings = $36 - $30 = $6

Therefore, David saves $6 by buyin...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Dasha spends on tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, the cost of one ride is 2 * $2 = $4.

Since there are 9 rides, Dasha spends 9 * $4 = $36 on tickets.

David, on the other hand, buys a ride bracelet for $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of the tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 9 rides at the carnival.
   * Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   * Each ticket costs $2.
   * A ride bracelet costs $30 and gives you 9 rides.
   * David buys a ride bracelet, and Dasha buys tickets.
   * They both ride all 9 rides.

2. Calculate the cost of Dasha's tickets:
   * Each ride requires 2 tickets, and there are 9 rides.
   * Total tickets needed =...
