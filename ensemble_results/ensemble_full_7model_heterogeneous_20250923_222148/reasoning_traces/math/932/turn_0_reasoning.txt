=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people involved**: 
   - Maria has invited 4 friends.
   - Therefore, the total number of people (including Maria) is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (friends)} + 1 \text{ (Maria)} = 5 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Calculate the initial number of water balloons**:
   - Each friend received 2 water balloons. So, the total number of water balloons given to her friends is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (friends)} \times 2 \text{ (balloons per friend)} = 8 \text{ balloons}
     \]
   - Maria has 1 water balloon for herself.

   Now, we add the balloons given to the friends and the one Maria has:
   \[
   8 \text{ (balloons for friends)} + 1 \text{ (balloon for Maria)} = 9 \text{ balloons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the additional balloons given by Maria's mom**:
   - Maria's mom gives each person (5 people) 3 more balloons. Therefore, the total number of additional balloons is:
     \[
     5 \text{ (people)} \times 3 \text{ (balloons per person)} = 15 \text{ balloons}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of balloons after the mom's contribution**:
   - We now add the initial total of balloons to the additional balloons given by Maria's mom:
   \[
   9 \text{ (initial balloons)} + 15 \text{ (additional balloons)} = 24 \text{ balloons}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of water balloons that the girls (and Maria) have is:
   \[
   \boxed{24}
   \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of people involved**: 
   - Maria has invited 4 friends.
   - Therefore, the total number of people (including Maria) is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (friends)} + 1 \text{ (Maria)} = 5 \text{ people}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. At the start of the game, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons each.
   * 4 friends x 2 balloons each = 8 balloons

2. Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
   * 1 balloon for Maria

3. Then, Maria's mom came out and gave each person 3 more balloons.
   * 4 friends x 3 balloons each = 12 balloons
   * 1 balloon for Maria

4. Now we add up all the balloons:
   * 8 balloons (from step 1) + 1 ba...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of water balloons that Maria and her friends have after receiving additional balloons from Maria's mom. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Distribution of Balloons:**
   - Maria invited 4 friends over, so there are 5 people in total (Maria + 4 friends).
   - At the start, Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons. Therefore, the total number of balloons given to her friends initial...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's count the initial balloons:
* Maria had 1 balloon for herself
* Each of her 4 friends got 2 balloons
* Number of balloons given to friends = 4 friends Ã— 2 balloons = 8 balloons
* Initial total = Maria's balloon + Friends' balloons
* Initial total = 1 + 8 = 9 balloons

2. Then Maria's mom gave more balloons:
* Each person got 3 more balloons
* Total people = Maria + 4 friends = 5 people
* Additional b...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many water balloons Maria initially gave to her friends. Since she gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, we multiply 4 (the number of friends) by 2 (the number of balloons each friend received). 

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Including the balloon Maria had for herself, the initial total number of balloons is 8 (from friends) + 1 (Maria's) = 9 balloons.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends, so 5 peop...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out the total number of water balloons the girls had, we need to calculate the number of balloons each person had and then add them together.

Given:
- Maria invited 4 friends over.
- At the start, Maria gave each friend 2 water balloons.
- Maria had 1 water balloon for herself.
- Maria's mom gave each person 3 more balloons.

Step 1: Calculate the number of balloons Maria's friends had at the start....
