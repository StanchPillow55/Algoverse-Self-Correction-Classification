=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to track the number of Post-it notes Candice had at different points in time and determine how many were in the package she purchased.

1. **Initial Count of Post-it Notes**: 
   Candice started with 80 Post-it notes.

2. **Post-it Notes Remaining**: 
   After placing Post-it notes on the coffee cups, she had 23 Post-it notes left.

3. **Post-it Notes Used**: 
   Candice placed a Post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. Therefore, the total number of Post-it notes she used is 220.

4. **Total Post-it Notes Before Using**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of Post-it notes in the package she purchased. After purchasing the package, the total number of Post-it notes she had before using any was:
   \[
   80 + x
   \]

5. **Post-it Notes After Using**: 
   After placing 220 Post-it notes on the coffee cups, the number of Post-it notes she had left is given by:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220
   \]
   We know from the problem that she had 23 Post-it notes remaining, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220 = 23
   \]

6. **Solving the Equation**:
   First, simplify the left side:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x - 140 = 23
   \]
   Now, add 140 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 23 + 140
   \]
   \[
   x = 163
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   The number of Post-it notes in the package that Candice purchased is \( \boxed{163} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify the key information:
* Candice started with 80 post-it notes
* She bought one package containing an unknown number of notes
* She used 220 notes (one on each coffee cup)
* She had 23 notes remaining

2. Let's set up an equation:
* Initial notes + Notes in package = Notes used + Notes remaining
* 80 + x = 220 + 23
* Where x = the number of notes in the package

3. Solve for x:
* 80 + x = 243
* x = 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended with 23 post-it notes. This means she used a total of 80 - 23 = 57 post-it notes from her initial stash.

However, she also placed a post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee. This means she used a total of 220 post-it notes at work.

Therefore, the number of post-it notes she must have purchased is the total number of post-it notes she used at work minus the number of post-it notes she used from her initial stash...
