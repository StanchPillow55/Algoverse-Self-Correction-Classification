=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate and then subtract that from the total number of sandwiches they had initially.

1. **Total number of sandwiches**: 
   Cody and Trevor had a total of 12 sandwiches.

2. **Cody's consumption**:
   Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. To find out how many sandwiches that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cody's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]
   So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

3. **Trevor's consumption**:
   Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. To find out how many sandwiches that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]
   So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

4. **Total sandwiches eaten**:
   Now, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by both Cody and Trevor:
   \[
   \text{Total eaten} = \text{Cody's sandwiches} + \text{Trevor's sandwiches} = 4 + 3 = 7
   \]

5. **Sandwiches left**:
   To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the total eaten from the initial total:
   \[
   \text{Sandwiches left} = \text{Total sandwiches} - \text{Total eaten} = 12 - 7 = 5
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **5 sandwiches left**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cody and Trevor had 12 sandwiches in total.
- Cody ate a third of the sandwiches.
- Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches.

Step 1: Calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate.
Cody ate a third of the 12 sandwiches.
Cody's share = 1/3 × 12 = 4 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate.
Trevor ate a quarter of the 12 sandwiches.
Trevor's share = 1/4 × 12 = 3 sandwiches

Step 3: C...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate and then subtract that total from the original number of sandwiches to find out how many are left.

1. **Determine how many sandwiches Cody ate:**
   - Cody ate a third of the sandwiches.
   - The total number of sandwiches is 12.
   - To find a third of the sandwiches, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]
   - So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

2. **Determine how many sa...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of sandwiches = 12

2. Calculate Cody's portion:
* Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches
* 1/3 of 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches eaten by Cody

3. Calculate Trevor's portion:
* Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches
* 1/4 of 12 = 12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches eaten by Trevor

4. Calculate total sandwiches eaten:
* Total eaten = Cody's portion + Trevor's portion
* Total eaten = 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches

5. Calculate remaining s...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Cody and Trevor ate.

Cody ate a third of the sandwiches. Since there were 12 sandwiches, we calculate this by dividing 12 by 3:

12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches

So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

Next, we determine how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches. We calculate this by dividing 12 by 4:

12 ÷ 4 = 3 sandwiches

So, Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.

To find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the numbe...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Cody and Trevor had a total of 12 sandwiches.
   * Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches.
   * Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches.

2. Calculate the number of sandwiches Cody ate:
   * Cody ate 1/3 of the sandwiches.
   * 1/3 of 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = 4 sandwiches
   So, Cody ate 4 sandwiches.

3. Calculate the number of sandwiches Trevor ate:
   * Trevor ate 1/4 of the sandwiches...
