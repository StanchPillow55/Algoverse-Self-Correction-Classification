=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money John makes in a week from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of apartments in each complex.

1. **First Complex**: 200 apartments
2. **Second Complex**: 200 apartments
3. **Third Complex**: The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined.

First, we calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes:
\[
\text{Total apartments in first two complexes} = 200 + 200 = 400
\]

Now, we calculate the number of apartments in the third complex:
\[
\text{Size of third complex} = 400 + 0.60 \times 400
\]
Calculating \(0.60 \times 400\):
\[
0.60 \times 400 = 240
\]
Now, adding this to the total of the first two complexes:
\[
\text{Total apartments in third complex} = 400 + 240 = 640
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of apartments.

Now we can find the total number of apartments across all three complexes:
\[
\text{Total apartments} = 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of collections per week.

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each complex. Therefore, the total number of collections per week is:
\[
\text{Total collections per week} = 3 \text{ collections/week} \times 3 \text{ complexes} = 9 \text{ collections/week}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the payment per collection.

John gets paid $0.40 per collection for each apartment. Therefore, for each collection, he earns:
\[
\text{Earnings per collection} = 0.40 \text{ dollars/apartment} \times \text{Number of apartments}
\]
Since he collects from all 1040 apartments in each collection:
\[
\text{Earnings per collection} = 0.40 \times 1040 = 416 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings for the week.

Now, we can calculate his total earnings for the week by multiplying the earnings per collection by the total number of collections:
\[
\text{Total earnings for the week} = \text{Earnings per collection} \times \text{Total collections per week}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for the week} = 416 \text{ dollars/collection} \times 9 \text{ collections/week}
\]
Calculating this:
\[
416 \times 9 = 3744 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, John makes a total of **$3744** in a week from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much John earns from collecting garbage from the three apartment complexes in a week. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apartments in each complex:**

   - The first two apartment complexes each have 200 apartments. Therefore, the total number of apartments in these two complexes is:
     \[
     200 + 200 = 400 \text{ apartments}
     \]

   - The third complex is 60% bigger than the ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many apartments are in the first two complexes combined:
* Complex 1 = 200 apartments
* Complex 2 = 200 apartments
* First two combined = 200 + 200 = 400 apartments

2. Now let's find how many apartments are in the third complex:
* Third complex is 60% bigger than 400
* 60% of 400 = 400 Ã— 0.60 = 240 additional apartments
* Third complex total = 400 + 240 = 640 apartments

3. Calculate total ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many apartments are in the third complex. The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so combined they have 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined, so it has 400 * 60/100 = 240 more apartments.

So, the third complex has 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

Now, let's find out how many apartments John collects garbage from in total. He collects from 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.

He collects ga...
