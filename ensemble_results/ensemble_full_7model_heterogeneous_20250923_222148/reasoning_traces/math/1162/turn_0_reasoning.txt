=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find Geb's age based on the information provided, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Identify Haley's Age**: We know from the problem that Haley is 26 years old.

2. **Calculate Half of Haley's Age**: 
   We need to find half of Haley's age:
   \[
   \text{Half of Haley's age} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]

3. **Determine Geb's Age**: 
   The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. Therefore, we need to subtract 10 from the half of Haley's age:
   \[
   \text{Geb's age} = \text{Half of Haley's age} - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   After performing the calculations, we find that Geb is 3 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Geb's age is } 3 \text{ years old.}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Geb's age based on the given information about Haley's age.

Given information:
- Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.
- Haley is 26 years old.

Step 1: Find half the age of Haley.
Half the age of Haley = 26 รท 2 = 13 years

Step 2: Find Geb's age based on the given information.
Geb's age = Half the age of Haley - 10
Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3 years

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

Final answer: Geb is 3 years ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine Geb's age based on the information given about Haley's age.

1. **Understand the relationship**: The problem states that Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age. We can express this relationship as an equation.

2. **Define the variables**:
   - Let \( H \) represent Haley's age.
   - Let \( G \) represent Geb's age.

3. **Write the equation**: According to the problem, Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age. Mathem...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Haley is 26 years old
* Geb is 10 less than half of Haley's age

2. Let's find half of Haley's age:
* Half of 26 = 26 รท 2 = 13

3. Now we know that Geb is 10 less than 13
* Geb's age = 13 - 10 = 3

4. Let's verify this makes sense:
* Half of Haley's age is 13
* Geb is 10 less than that, so 3
* 3 is indeed 10 less than half of 26

Final Answer: Geb is 3 years old

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age would be 26/2 = 13 years old.

The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. So, to find Geb's age, we subtract 10 from half of Haley's age.

So, Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Haley is 26 years old.
   * Geb's age is 10 less than half of Haley's age.

2. Calculate half of Haley's age:
   * Half of Haley's age = 26 รท 2
   * Half of Haley's age = 13

3. Subtract 10 from half of Haley's age to find Geb's age:
   * Geb's age = Half of Haley's age - 10
   * Geb's age = 13 - 10
   * Geb's age = 3

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.
