=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Robert went down the water slide based on the information given about Mitchel and Anne.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide:**
   - Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
   - To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we first calculate 30% of Mitchel's 30 times:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Mitchel's total to find Anne's total:
     \[
     \text{Anne's total} = 30 - 9 = 21
     \]

2. **Determine how many times Robert went down the slide:**
   - Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
   - Since we found that Anne went down the slide 21 times, we calculate Robert's total:
     \[
     \text{Robert's total} = 4 \times 21 = 84
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Robert went down the water slide **84 times**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
- Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
- Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

Step 1: Calculate how many times Anne went down the water slide.
Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
30% of 30 = 0.3 × 30 = 9
Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Step 2: Calcu...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Robert went down the water slide, given the information about how many times Mitchel and Anne went down the slide.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide:**

   - We know that Mitchel went down the slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.

   To find out how many times Anne went down the slide, we first calculate 30% of the number of times Mitchel went down:

   \[

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Mitchel went down 30 times
* Anne went down 30% less than Mitchel
* Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne

2. Let's find how many times Anne went down:
* 30% less than Mitchel means we subtract 30% from 30
* 30% of 30 = 0.30 × 30 = 9
* So Anne went down: 30 - 9 = 21 times

3. Now let's find Robert's turns:
* Robert went 4 times as much as Anne
* So Robert's turns = 21 × 4 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 (Mitchel's total), which is 0.30 * 30 = 9.

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply Anne's total by 4, which is 21 * 4 = 84.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
   * Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel.
   * Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.

2. Calculate the number of times Anne went down the slide:
   * Anne's slides = Mitchel's slides - 30% of Mitchel's slides
   * 30% of Mitchel's slides = 0.3 × 30 = 9
   * Anne's slides = 30 - 9 = 21
   
   So, An...
