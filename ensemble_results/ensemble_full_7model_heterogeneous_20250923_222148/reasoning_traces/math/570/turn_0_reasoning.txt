=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total amount Peter has**: 
   Peter starts with $70.

2. **Determine the number of days in a week**: 
   There are 7 days in a week.

3. **Calculate the daily spending amount**: 
   Since Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, we divide his total amount by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
   \]

4. **Determine spending on wooden action figures**: 
   From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spends money on wooden action figures, which cost $5 each. He spends for 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday):
   \[
   \text{Total spent on wooden figures} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of wooden action figures bought**: 
   Since each wooden action figure costs $5, we can find out how many he bought:
   \[
   \text{Number of wooden figures} = \frac{40 \text{ dollars}}{5 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 8 \text{ wooden figures}
   \]

6. **Determine spending on plastic action figures**: 
   For the remaining days (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), Peter will buy plastic action figures, which cost $2 each. He spends for 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Total spent on plastic figures} = 10 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the number of plastic action figures bought**: 
   Since each plastic action figure costs $2, we can find out how many he bought:
   \[
   \text{Number of plastic figures} = \frac{30 \text{ dollars}}{2 \text{ dollars/figure}} = 15 \text{ plastic figures}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total number of action figures**: 
   Now, we add the number of wooden figures and plastic figures to find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total action figures} = \text{Number of wooden figures} + \text{Number of plastic figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Peter will have a total of **23 action figures** by the end of the week.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has $70 to spend.
- He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
- From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each.
- For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each.

Step 1: Calculate how much Peter can spend each day.
Total amount: $70
Number of days in a week: 7
Amount per day = $70 / 7 = $...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter buys throughout the week, given his budget and the cost of each type of action figure.

**Step 1: Determine the daily spending limit.**

Peter has $70 to spend over one week (7 days). To find out how much he can spend each day, we divide his total money by the number of days:

\[
\text{Daily spending limit} = \frac{70}{7} = 10
\]

So, Peter can spend $10 each day.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much Peter can spend each day
* He has $70 total for 7 days
* $70 รท 7 = $10 per day

2. Let's count Sunday through Wednesday (4 days)
* Each wooden figure costs $5
* Daily spending is $10
* Number of wooden figures per day = $10 รท $5 = 2 figures
* Total wooden figures for 4 days = 2 figures ร 4 days = 8 wooden figures

3. Let's count Thursday through Saturday (3 days)
* Each plastic figu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for a week. A week has 7 days, so Peter will spend $70/7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, each day he bought $10/$5 = 2 wooden action figures. Since he bought wooden action figures for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday), he bought 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday through Saturday), Peter w...
