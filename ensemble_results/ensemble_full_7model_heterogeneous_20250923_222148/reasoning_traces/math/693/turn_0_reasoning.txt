Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the number of each colored square on Brittany's comforter step by step.

1. **Determine the number of red squares:**
   - According to the problem, Brittany has 14 red squares.
   \[
   \text{Red squares} = 14
   \]

2. **Determine the number of blue squares:**
   - The problem states that there are 4 more blue squares than red squares. Therefore, we can calculate the number of blue squares as follows:
   \[
   \text{Blue squares} = \text{Red squares} + 4 = 14 + 4 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine the number of green squares:**
   - Next, we know that there are 6 more green squares than blue squares. So, we can find the number of green squares:
   \[
   \text{Green squares} = \text{Blue squares} + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine the number of white squares:**
   - Finally, the problem states that there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares. Thus, we can calculate the number of white squares:
   \[
   \text{White squares} = \text{Green squares} - 12 = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of squares:**
   - Now that we have the number of squares of each color, we can find the total number of squares by adding them all together:
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = \text{Red squares} + \text{Blue squares} + \text{Green squares} + \text{White squares}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total squares} = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12
   \]

   Now, performing the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add red and blue:
   \[
   14 + 18 = 32
   \]
   - Next, add the result to the green squares:
   \[
   32 + 24 = 56
   \]
   - Finally, add the white squares:
   \[
   56 + 12 = 68
   \]

Thus, the total number of square feet in Brittany's comforter is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of squares in the comforter and then multiply it by the size of each square (1 square foot) to get the total area of the comforter.

Given information:
- The comforter has 14 red squares.
- The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
- The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
- The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the total number of square feet in Brittany's quilted comforter, we need to calculate the total number of colored squares. Each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, so the total number of squares will equal the total square footage.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Red Squares:**
   - Brittany's comforter has 14 red squares.

2. **Blue Squares:**
   - There are 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   - Number of blue squares = Number of red squares ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of squares of each color:

   * Red squares = 14 squares
   
   * Blue squares = Red squares + 4
   * Blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18 squares
   
   * Green squares = Blue squares + 6
   * Green squares = 18 + 6 = 24 squares
   
   * White squares = Green squares - 12
   * White squares = 24 - 12 = 12 squares

2. To find the total area of the comforter, I need to:
   * Add up all the squar...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by determining the number of squares of each color.

We know that there are 14 red squares.

The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = <<14+4=18>>18 blue squares.

There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = <<18+6=24>>24 green squares.

There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = <<24-12=12>>12 white squares.

Now, we can add up all the squares to find the total nu...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The comforter has 14 red squares.
   * It has 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   * It has 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   * It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   * Each square is 1-foot by 1-foot.

2. Calculate the number of blue squares:
   * Blue squares = Red squares + 4
   * Blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

3. Calculate the number of gree...
