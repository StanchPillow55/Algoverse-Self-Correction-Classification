=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David based on the information given.

1. **Identify the amount of laundry Sarah does**:
   - We know from the problem that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Calculate the amount of laundry David does**:
   - The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. We can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry}
     \]
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     400 = 4D
     \]
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
     \]
   - So, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

3. **Calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does**:
   - The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. We can express this relationship as:
     \[
     \text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry}
     \]
   - Substituting Sarah's amount:
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
     \]
   - Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

4. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do**:
   - We need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount of laundry David does:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = R - D = 200 - 100 = 100
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( \boxed{100} \) pounds.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 1: Calculate how much laundry Sarah does.
Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 2: Calculate how much laundry David does.
Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.
David's laundry = 400 p...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry
* Raymond does half as much as Sarah
* Sarah does 4 times as much as David

2. Let's find how much laundry David does:
* Sarah does 4 times David's amount
* 400 = 4 × David's amount
* David's amount = 400 ÷ 4
* David does 100 pounds of laundry

3. Let's find how much laundry Raymond does:
* Raymond does half of Sarah's amount
* Raymond's amount = 4...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.

Given that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, we can calculate the amount of laundry Raymond does by dividing Sarah's laundry by 2.

Raymond's laundry = Sarah's laundry / 2
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds / 2
Raymond's laundry = 200 pounds

Next, we know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. So, to find out how much laundry David does, we divide Sar...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 1: Let's express Raymond's and David's laundry in terms of Sarah's.
- Raymond's laundry = 1/2 × Sarah's laundry
- David's laundry = 1/4 × Sarah's laundry (because Sarah does 4 times as much as David, so David does 1/4 of Sarah's laundry)

Step 2: Calculate the amount ...
