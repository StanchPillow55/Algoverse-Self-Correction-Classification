=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many lollipops Ray shared.**
   - Ray initially had 25 lollipops.
   - He kept 5 lollipops for himself.
   - To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total number he had:
     \[
     \text{Lollipops shared} = \text{Total lollipops} - \text{Lollipops kept} = 25 - 5 = 20
     \]

2. **Determine how many friends Ray shared with.**
   - Ray shared the lollipops equally with his four friends.

3. **Calculate how many lollipops each friend received.**
   - Since Ray shared the 20 lollipops equally among his four friends, we need to divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:
     \[
     \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{\text{Lollipops shared}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

Thus, the final answer is that each of Ray's friends received **5 lollipops**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Ray had 25 lollipops.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Ray started with 25 lollipops

2. Calculate how many lollipops are left to share:
* Starting amount: 25 lollipops
* Ray kept: 5 lollipops
* Remaining lollipops = 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops

3. Calculate how many lollipops each friend gets:
* Number of friends = 4
* Lollipops to share = 20
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ray had 25 lollipops and he kept 5 for himself. This means he had 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops left to share with his friends.

Ray has 4 friends and he wants to share the 20 lollipops equally among them. To find out how many each friend gets, we divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends.

So, 20 lollipops รท 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Ray had a total of 25 lollipops.
   * He kept 5 lollipops for himself.
   * He shared the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends.

2. Calculate the number of lollipops Ray shared with his friends:
   * Lollipops shared = Total lollipops - Lollipops Ray kept
   * Lollipops shared = 25 - 5
   * Lollipops shared = 20

3. Divide the shared lollipops equally ...
