Final Answer: To determine how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we need to calculate the total cost for each amusement park based on the given fees and the number of adults and children in the family.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the first amusement park.**

The fees for the first amusement park are:
- Adult fee: $26
- Child fee: $12

Given that there are 2 adults and 2 children, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Adult fee} = 2 \times 26 = 52
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Child fee} = 2 \times 12 = 24
\]

Now, we add the total costs for adults and children to find the total cost for the first amusement park:

\[
\text{Total cost for first amusement park} = \text{Total cost for adults} + \text{Total cost for children} = 52 + 24 = 76
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost for the second amusement park.**

The fees for the second amusement park are:
- Adult fee: $14
- Child fee: $10

Using the same number of adults and children (2 adults and 2 children), we calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Adult fee} = 2 \times 14 = 28
\]

\[
\text{Total cost for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Child fee} = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

Now, we add the total costs for adults and children to find the total cost for the second amusement park:

\[
\text{Total cost for second amusement park} = \text{Total cost for adults} + \text{Total cost for children} = 28 + 20 = 48
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the second amusement park.**

To find out how much they will save by choosing the second amusement park over the first, we subtract the total cost of the second amusement park from the total cost of the first amusement park:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost for first amusement park} - \text{Total cost for second amusement park} = 76 - 48 = 28
\]

**Final Answer:**
Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park over the first.
