=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests.**
2. **Determine how many cookies the bride donated to the church.**
3. **Calculate how many people were in the church based on the number of cookies each received.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies

Each of the 100 guests brought a plate of 15 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Cookies per guest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cookies} = 100 \times 15 = 1500
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many cookies were donated to the church

The bride decided to give half of the total cookies to the church. We can calculate the number of cookies donated as follows:

\[
\text{Cookies donated} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cookies}
\]

Substituting the total number of cookies:

\[
\text{Cookies donated} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many people were in the church

Each person in the church received 15 cookies. To find the number of people in the church, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = \frac{\text{Cookies donated}}{\text{Cookies per person}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = \frac{750}{15}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people in church} = 50
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of people in the church next door is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
