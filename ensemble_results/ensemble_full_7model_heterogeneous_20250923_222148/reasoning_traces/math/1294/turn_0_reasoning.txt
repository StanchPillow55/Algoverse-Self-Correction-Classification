Final Answer: To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts

1. **Original price of each T-shirt**: $8
2. **Buy one get one 50% off deal**: This means that when Jake buys one T-shirt at full price, he gets the second one at half price.

   - **Cost of the first T-shirt**: $8 (full price)
   - **Cost of the second T-shirt**: $8 * 50% = $8 * 0.5 = $4 (50% off)

3. **Total cost for the T-shirts**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for T-shirts} = \text{Cost of first T-shirt} + \text{Cost of second T-shirt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for T-shirts} = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes

1. **Original price of the shoes**: $40
2. **Discount on the shoes**: 40% off

   - **Amount of discount**: $40 * 40% = $40 * 0.4 = $16
   - **Cost after discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = 40 - 16 = 24
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

1. **Total amount spent**:
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for T-shirts} + \text{Cost of shoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 12 + 24 = 36
   \]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money Jake spends at the store is **$36**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts with the buy one get one 50% off deal
   * First T-shirt: $8 (full price)
   * Second T-shirt: $8 × 0.50 = $4 (50% off)
   * Total cost of T-shirts = $8 + $4 = $12

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes with 40% off
   * Original price: $40
   * Discount: $40 × 0.40 = $16
   * Final shoe price = $40 - $16 = $24

3. Finally, let's add up the total cost

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the T-shirts. 

The first T-shirt costs $8, and the second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. 

So, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. 

The shoes are 40% off, so the discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16.

So, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spe...
