=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by both the students and the teachers at Ashley's school.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students
We know that there are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. Therefore, the total number of students can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total students} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Average number of students per class}
\]
\[
\text{Total students} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of teachers
Each class has an average of 3 teachers. Thus, the total number of teachers can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Total teachers} = \text{Number of classes} \times \text{Average number of teachers per class}
\]
\[
\text{Total teachers} = 40 \times 3 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by students
Each student plants 1 tree. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by students is:

\[
\text{Trees planted by students} = \text{Total students} \times 1
\]
\[
\text{Trees planted by students} = 1000 \times 1 = 1000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers
Each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

\[
\text{Trees planted by teachers} = \text{Total teachers} \times 2
\]
\[
\text{Trees planted by teachers} = 120 \times 2 = 240
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted
Now, we can find the total number of trees planted by adding the trees planted by students and teachers:

\[
\text{Total trees planted} = \text{Trees planted by students} + \text{Trees planted by teachers}
\]
\[
\text{Total trees planted} = 1000 + 240 = 1240
\]

### Final Answer
At the end of the campaign, the total number of trees planted will be:

\[
\boxed{1240}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* 40 classes
* 25 students per class
* 3 teachers per class
* Each student plants 1 tree
* Each teacher plants 2 trees

2. Calculate total number of students:
* Students per class × Number of classes
* 25 × 40 = 1,000 students

3. Calculate total number of teachers:
* Teachers per class × Number of classes
* 3 × 40 = 120 teachers

4. Calculate trees planted by students:

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school.

The total number of students is the number of classes multiplied by the average number of students per class. So, 40 classes * 25 students/class = 1000 students.

The total number of teachers is the number of classes multiplied by the number of teachers per class. So, 40 classes * 3 teachers/class = 120 teachers.

Next, let's calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and tea...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

Given information:
- Each child plants 1 tree
- Each teacher plants 2 trees
- The school has 40 classes
- There is an average of 25 students per class
- There are 3 teachers per class

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students in the school.
Total students = Number of classes × Average students per class
Total students = 40 × 25 = 1,000 students
