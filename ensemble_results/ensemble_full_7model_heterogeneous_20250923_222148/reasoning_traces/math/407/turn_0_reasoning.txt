=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **Total Steps Goal**: Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day.

2. **Steps Completed from School Walks**: It is stated that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Since he aims for 10,000 steps, half of that is:
   \[
   \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

3. **Steps from Short Walk with Friend**: Elliott also took an additional 1,000 steps while going for a short walk with his friend. Therefore, we can add this to the steps he completed from school:
   \[
   5,000 \text{ (from school)} + 1,000 \text{ (with friend)} = 6,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

4. **Remaining Steps**: After completing 6,000 steps, we need to find out how many steps he has left to reach his goal of 10,000 steps. We can calculate this by subtracting the steps he has already taken from his total goal:
   \[
   10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

5. **Steps Left After Jog**: The problem states that after finishing his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that the number of steps he took during his jog can be calculated by finding the difference between the steps he had left before the jog and the steps he had left after the jog:
   \[
   4,000 \text{ (steps left before jog)} - 2,000 \text{ (steps left after jog)} = 2,000 \text{ steps}
   \]

Thus, the number of steps Elliott took during his jog is:
\[
\boxed{2000}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took during his jog. We can do this by analyzing the information given and performing some calculations.

1. **Total Steps Goal:**
   Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps in a day.

2. **Steps Completed on Walks to and from School:**
   Elliott completed half of his total steps on his walks to and from school. 
   \[
   \text{Steps on walks to and from school} = \frac{10,000}{2} = 5,000 \text{ steps}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Elliott's daily goal is 10,000 steps
* He did half of his steps walking to/from school
* He did 1,000 steps walking with his friend
* After his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take
* We need to find how many steps he took during his jog

2. Calculate steps taken to/from school:
* Half of 10,000 = 10,000 รท 2 = 5,000 steps

3. Let's track his steps in order:
* School walks: 5,0...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Elliott's goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day. 

First, he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school. Half of 10,000 steps is 10,000/2 = 5,000 steps.

Then, he did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, the total steps he had taken so far is 5,000 steps (from school) + 1,000 steps (with his friend) = 6,000 steps.

After his jog, he realized he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means he had already taken 10,000 steps (total) -...
