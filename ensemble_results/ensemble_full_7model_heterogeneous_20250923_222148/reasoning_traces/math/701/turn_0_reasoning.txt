=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the group.**
   - Aiden has 12 friends, so that makes 13 people (Aiden + 12 friends).
   - They meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     13 + 7 = 20
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of seats needed.**
   - Since each person saves a seat, the total number of seats needed is equal to the total number of people:
     \[
     \text{Total seats} = 20
     \]

3. **Determine the number of drinks and snacks needed per person.**
   - Each seat can hold:
     - 1 person
     - 2 drinks
     - 3 snacks
   - Therefore, for 20 people, the total number of drinks and snacks needed is:
     - Total drinks:
       \[
       20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ drinks/person} = 40 \text{ drinks}
       \]
     - Total snacks:
       \[
       20 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ snacks/person} = 60 \text{ snacks}
       \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks.**
   - The cost of each drink and each snack is $2.
   - Total cost for drinks:
     \[
     40 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/drink} = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for snacks:
     \[
     60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/snack} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the overall total cost.**
   - The overall total cost for drinks and snacks is:
     \[
     80 \text{ dollars (drinks)} + 120 \text{ dollars (snacks)} = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of people going to the cinema. Aiden, his 12 friends, and the 7 friends they meet up with at the cinema makes a total of 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (friends they meet at the cinema) = 20 people.

Each person saves a seat, and each seat has enough room for two drinks and three snacks. Therefore, for 20 people, there will be 20 * 2 = 40 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

Each drink and snack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost of t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Determine the total number of people in the group:
   * Aiden and 12 of his friends meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema.
   * Total number of people = Aiden + 12 friends + 7 more friends
   * Total number of people = 1 + 12 + 7 = 20 people

2. Calculate the number of seats saved:
   * Each person saves a seat.
   * Number of seats saved = Total number of people
   * Number of seats saved = 20 ...
