=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's define the ages of each person in the problem using variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( y \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( z \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:
   \[
   x = y - 3
   \]

2. I am two years older than my sister:
   \[
   x = z + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age:
   \[
   m = 3y - 1
   \]

4. The sum of all our ages is 87:
   \[
   x + y + z + m = 87
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( m \) in terms of \( y \) and \( z \) into the equation for the sum of ages.

First, we can express \( z \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
z = x - 2
\]

Now substituting \( z \) into the sum of ages equation:
\[
x + y + (x - 2) + (3y - 1) = 87
\]

Now simplify this equation:
\[
x + y + x - 2 + 3y - 1 = 87
\]
\[
2x + 4y - 3 = 87
\]

Now, add 3 to both sides:
\[
2x + 4y = 90
\]

Next, divide the entire equation by 2:
\[
x + 2y = 45
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \( x = y - 3 \)
2. \( x + 2y = 45 \)

We can substitute the first equation into the second:
\[
(y - 3) + 2y = 45
\]
\[
y - 3 + 2y = 45
\]
\[
3y - 3 = 45
\]

Now, add 3 to both sides:
\[
3y = 48
\]

Now, divide by 3:
\[
y = 16
\]

Now that we have my brother's age, we can find my age using the first equation:
\[
x = y - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13
\]

Next, we can find my sister's age:
\[
z = x - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11
\]

Finally, we can find my mom's age:
\[
m = 3y - 1 = 3(16) - 1 = 48 - 1 = 47
\]

Now let's check the sum of all ages:
\[
x + y + z + m = 13 + 16 + 11 + 47 = 87
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, my age is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- You are 3 years younger than your brother.
- You are 2 years older than your sister.
- Your mom's age is 1 less than 3 times your brother's age.
- The sum of all your ages is 87.

Let's define the variables:
- Let your brother's age be x.
- Then, your age is x - 3.
- Your sister's age is x - 5 (since you are 2 years older than her).
- Your mom's age is 3x - 1.

Now, we can set up an equat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the unknowns. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be my age.
- Let \( b \) be my brother's age.
- Let \( s \) be my sister's age.
- Let \( m \) be my mom's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. I am three years younger than my brother:  
   \[
   x = b - 3
   \]

2. I am 2 years older than my sister:  
   \[
   x = s + 2
   \]

3. My mom's age...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Let's define variables:
* Let my age be x
* My brother's age = x + 3 (since he's 3 years older than me)
* My sister's age = x - 2 (since she's 2 years younger than me)
* My mom's age = 3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 8 (three times my brother's age minus 1)

Since all ages add up to 87:
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87

Let's solve the equation:
1. Combine like terms:
   * x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87
   * 6x + 9 = 87

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the ages as follows:

- My age = x
- My brother's age = x + 3 (since I am three years younger than my brother)
- My sister's age = x - 2 (since I am two years older than my sister)
- My mom's age = 3*(x + 3) - 1 (since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all our ages is 87. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3*(x + 3) - 1] = 87

Solving this equation step by step:
