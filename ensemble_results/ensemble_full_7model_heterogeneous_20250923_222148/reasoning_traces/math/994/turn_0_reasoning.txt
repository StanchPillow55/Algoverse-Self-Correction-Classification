=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the duration of howls for each of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for a total of 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
     \[
     \text{Chikote's howl} = 2 \times \text{Tobias's howl} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Igneous's Howl:**
   - Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.
   - First, we need to find the combined duration of Tobias's and Chikote's howls:
     \[
     \text{Combined howl of Tobias and Chikote} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Igneous's howl duration is:
     \[
     \text{Igneous's howl} = \text{Combined howl of Tobias and Chikote} = 60 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Total Duration of Howls:**
   - Now we can find the total duration of all three howls:
     \[
     \text{Total howl duration} = \text{Tobias's howl} + \text{Chikote's howl} + \text{Igneous's howl}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total howl duration} = 20 \text{ seconds} + 40 \text{ seconds} + 60 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ seconds}
     \]

5. **Convert Total Duration to Minutes:**
   - To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \text{Total howl duration in minutes} = \frac{120 \text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is:

\[
\boxed{2} \text{ minutes}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine the duration of howls for each of the three wolves: Tobias, Chikote, and Igneous.

1. **Tobias's Howl:**
   - Tobias howls for a total of 20 seconds.

2. **Chikote's Howl:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is:
     \[
     \text{Chikote's howl} = 2 \times \text{Tobias's howl} = 2 \times 20 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Igneous's Howl:**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the length of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl = 2 × Tobias' howl
Chikote's howl = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the length of Igneous' howl.
Igneous' howl = Tobias' howl + Chikote's howl
Igneous' howl = 20 second...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the duration of each wolf's howl and then find the combined length of time for all three wolves.

1. **Determine Tobias's Howl Duration:**
   - Tobias howls for 20 seconds per howl.

2. **Determine Chikote's Howl Duration:**
   - Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
   - Therefore, Chikote's howl duration is \(2 \times 20\) seconds.
   - Chikote howls for 40 seconds.

3. **Determine Igneous's Howl Duration:**
   - Igneous...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Tobias howls for 20 seconds
* Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias
* Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined

2. Let's find Chikote's howl length:
* Chikote = 2 × Tobias
* Chikote = 2 × 20 = 40 seconds

3. Let's find Igneous's howl length:
* Igneous = Tobias + Chikote
* Igneous = 20 + 40 = 60 seconds

4. Now let's find the total time for all three wolves...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote howls for 2 * 20 seconds = 40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) = 60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the howling times of all three wolves to get the total howling time.

The total howling time is 20 seconds (Tobias) + 40 seconds (Chikote) + 60 s...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the total time the three wolves howl in minutes.

Given:
- Tobias howls for 20 seconds each time.
- Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias.
- Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.

Step 1: Calculate the duration of Chikote's howl.
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × Tobias's howl duration
Chikote's howl duration = 2 × 20 seconds = 40 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the duration ...
