=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of girls in the choir**:
   The choir has a total of 52 members. According to the problem, 50% of the members are girls. 

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
   \]

2. **Determine the number of boys in the choir**:
   Since 50% of the members are boys, the number of boys is also:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 50\% \text{ of } 52 = 0.5 \times 52 = 26
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of girls who can perform**:
   On the day of the performance, half of the girls cannot make it because their bus breaks down. Therefore, we need to find out how many girls are left to perform.

   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can't make it} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls who can perform} = 26 - 13 = 13
   \]

4. **Include the teachers in the performance**:
   The problem states that the choir's 3 teachers decide to sing with the remaining girls. Therefore, we need to add the number of teachers to the number of girls who can perform.

   \[
   \text{Total performers} = \text{Number of girls who can perform} + \text{Number of teachers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total performers} = 13 + 3 = 16
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of people who sang in the performance is:

   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many girls are in the choir
* Total choir members = 52
* Girls = 50% of total
* 50% of 52 = 52 × 0.5 = 26 girls

2. Only the female members will perform
* Starting number of performers = 26 girls

3. Half of the performers can't make it due to bus breakdown
* Half can't perform = 26 × 0.5 = 13 girls can't perform
* Remaining performers = 26 - 13 = 13 girls can perform

4. Add the 3 teachers ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The choir has 52 members, and we know that 50% of them are girls. To find out how many girls there are, we multiply the total number of members by 50%. 

52 members * 50% = 26 girls

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. To find out how many girls are left, we divide the total number of girls by 2.

26 girls / 2 = 13 girls

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. To find out the total number of people w...
