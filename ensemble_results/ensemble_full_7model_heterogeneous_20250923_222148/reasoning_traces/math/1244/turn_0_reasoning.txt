=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on her second test to pass to the 7th grade, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests.**
   - First test: 70 questions
   - Second test: 40 questions
   - Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. **Determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - To find 70% of 110 questions:
     \[
     0.70 \times 110 = 77 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - Therefore, Audrey needs to answer at least 77 questions correctly to pass.

3. **Calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test.**
   - She answered 60% of the 70 questions correctly.
   - To find out how many she got correct:
     \[
     0.60 \times 70 = 42 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

4. **Determine how many more questions she needs to get correct on the second test.**
   - We already calculated that she needs a total of 77 correct answers.
   - She has already answered 42 questions correctly from the first test.
   - Therefore, the number of correct answers needed from the second test is:
     \[
     77 - 42 = 35 \text{ questions}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Audrey needs to answer **35 questions correctly** on the second test to pass to the 7th grade.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of questions across both tests:
   * Test 1: 70 questions
   * Test 2: 40 questions
   * Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. To pass, she needs 70% of 110 questions correct
   * 70% of 110 = 0.70 × 110 = 77 questions needed correct in total

3. On Test 1, she got 60% correct
   * 60% of 70 questions = 0.60 × 70 = 42 questions correct on Test 1

4. To find how many she ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many total questions Audrey has to answer across both tests. 

The total number of questions is 70 (from the first test) + 40 (from the second test) = 110 questions.

To pass to the 7th grade, Audrey needs to answer 70% of the total questions correctly. 

70% of 110 questions is 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions.

Now, let's find out how many questions Audrey answered correctly in the first test. 

60% of 70 questions is 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.
