=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 using those pods.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - The regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - To find 20% of 100, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of pods in the special size box is:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The special size box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1:**
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, we need to find out how many pods can be purchased for $1.
   - To find the number of pods for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:
     \[
     \text{Number of pods for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Since each pod corresponds to one dishwashing cycle, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is:
     \[
     \boxed{10}
     \] 

Thus, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 using the pods from the special size box.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
- There is a special size box that has 20% more pods for the same price of $12.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box.
Regular box size = 100 pods
Special box size = Regular box size + 20% of regular box size
Special box size = 100 + (0.20 × 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 pods

Step 2: Calculate the cost per pod in the special...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dishwasher pods are in the special size box and then calculate how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1 using this box.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of pods in the special size box

The regular box contains 100 dishwasher pods. The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.

First, calculate 20% of 100 pods:
\[
20\% \text{ of } 100 = \frac{20}{100} \times 100 = 20 \text{ pods}
\]

Now, add this ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many pods are in the special size box
* Regular box has 100 pods
* Special box has 20% more
* 20% of 100 = 100 × 0.20 = 20 additional pods
* Special box total = 100 + 20 = 120 pods

2. The special box costs $12 for 120 pods
* To find pods per $1, divide total pods by total cost
* 120 pods ÷ $12 = 10 pods per dollar

3. Since each cycle uses 1 pod:
* Number of cycles = number of pods
* Theref...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. If the regular box has 100 pods and the special size box has 20% more, we can calculate the number of pods in the special size box as follows:

100 pods + (100 pods * 20/100) = 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods

So, the special size box has 120 pods.

Now, we need to find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1. Since the special size box costs $12, we can calculate the cost per cycle as follows:

$12 ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
   * The special size box has 20% more pods for the same price.
   * 1 pod is used per dishwashing cycle.

2. Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:
   * The special size box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   * 20% of 100 pods = 100 × 0.20 = 20 pods
   * Number of pods in the special size box = 100...
