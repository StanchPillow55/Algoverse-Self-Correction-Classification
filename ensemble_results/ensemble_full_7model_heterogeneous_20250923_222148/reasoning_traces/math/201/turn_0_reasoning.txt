Final Answer: To determine how much money John made that year after receiving the award, we need to calculate his total earnings from his salary and the one-time monetary reward.

### Step 1: Calculate John's annual salary before the raise

John makes $2000 a week. To find his annual salary before the raise, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year:

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = \text{Weekly Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Year}
\]

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = 2000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 52 \, \text{weeks/year} = 104000 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the raise

John receives a 5% raise on his salary. To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 5% of his current annual salary:

\[
\text{Raise} = \text{Annual Salary} \times 0.05
\]

\[
\text{Raise} = 104000 \, \text{dollars/year} \times 0.05 = 5200 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate John's new annual salary after the raise

Now, we add the raise to his original annual salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Salary} + \text{Raise}
\]

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = 104000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 5200 \, \text{dollars/year} = 109200 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for the year

John also receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. To find his total earnings for the year, we add this reward to his new annual salary:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{New Annual Salary} + \text{One-time Reward}
\]

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 109200 \, \text{dollars/year} + 5000 \, \text{dollars} = 114200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[
\boxed{114200} \, \text{dollars}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings for the year, taking into account the one-time monetary reward and the 5% raise in his salary.

Given information:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Base weekly salary = $2,000
* One-time award = $5,000
* Salary raise = 5%
* Award received on first day of year
* Need to calculate full year earnings

2. Calculate new weekly salary after 5% raise:
* 5% of $2,000 = $2,000 × 0.05 = $100
* New weekly salary = $2,000 + $100 = $2,100

3. Calculate annual salary from weekly pay:
* Weeks in a year = 52
* Annual salary = $2,100 × 5...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 every week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

2000 * 52 = $104,000

Next, let's calculate the amount of the raise. A 5% raise on $104,000 is:

0.05 * 104,000 = $5200

So, after the raise, John's annual salary is:

104,000 + 5200 = $109,200

Finally, we add the one-time award of $5000 to his annual salary:

109,200 + 5000 = $114,200

So, John made $114,200 that year.
