=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Andrea saved before spending on the sweater and giving money to her brother.

1. **Identify the total amount Andrea had initially**: 
   Andrea started with $36.

2. **Identify the expenses**:
   - She spent $11 on a sweater.
   - She gave her brother $4.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   To find out how much Andrea spent in total, we add the cost of the sweater and the amount given to her brother:
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Cost of sweater} + \text{Amount given to brother} = 11 + 4 = 15
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Andrea had left after spending**:
   We subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount Andrea had:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spent} = 36 - 15 = 21
   \]

5. **Determine how much Andrea saved**:
   Since we know that the money left after her expenses is $21, we can conclude that this amount represents the money she saved. Therefore, the amount Andrea saved is:
   \[
   \text{Amount saved} = \text{Money left} = 21
   \]

Thus, after working through the problem step by step, we find that the amount Andrea saved is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Andrea spent a total of $11 (for the sweater) + $4 (given to her brother) = $<<11+4=15>>15.

She started with $36, so if we subtract the amount she spent, we can find out how much she saved. 

So, $36 (initial amount) - $15 (amount spent) = $21.

Therefore, Andrea saved $21.
