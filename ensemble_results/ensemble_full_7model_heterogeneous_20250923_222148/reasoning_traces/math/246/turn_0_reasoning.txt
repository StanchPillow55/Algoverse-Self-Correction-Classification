=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Jean paid for the makeup artist's services, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost per day for the makeup artist:**
   - The makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
   - It takes 6 hours to do the makeup each day.
   - Therefore, the cost for one day is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per day} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours per day} = 250 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 1500 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost per week:**
   - Jean needs the makeup done 4 times a week.
   - Thus, the total cost for one week is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per week} = \text{Cost per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 1500 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days/week} = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the entire duration of the movie:**
   - The movie takes 5 weeks to finish.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the entire duration is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 6000 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 30000 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the discount given by the makeup artist:**
   - The makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount on the total cost.
   - To find the discount amount:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = \text{Total cost} \times 0.10 = 30000 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.10 = 3000 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the final amount Jean has to pay after the discount:**
   - Subtract the discount from the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 30000 \, \text{dollars} - 3000 \, \text{dollars} = 27000 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount Jean paid for the makeup artist's services is:

\[
\boxed{27000} \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours of makeup work per week

Jean requires 6 hours of makeup each day, and she needs this done 4 times a week. Therefore, the total number of hours per week is calculated as follows:

\[
6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ hours/week}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hour...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost per day:
* Cost per hour = $250
* Hours per day = 6
* Daily cost = $250 × 6 = $1,500 per day

2. Next, let's calculate the cost per week:
* Days per week = 4
* Weekly cost = $1,500 × 4 = $6,000 per week

3. Now, let's calculate the total cost for all 5 weeks:
* Number of weeks = 5
* Total cost before discount = $6,000 × 5 = $30,000

4. Finally, let's apply the 10% discount:
* 10% o...
