=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela will need to pack for her vacation, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed per day**:
   Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour she is outside. If she is outside for 4 hours a day, the total amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Sunscreen per day} = \text{hours outside} \times \text{sunscreen per hour} = 4 \text{ hours} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire vacation**:
   Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day over 8 days. Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she will need for the entire vacation is:
   \[
   \text{Total sunscreen} = \text{Sunscreen per day} \times \text{number of days} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are needed**:
   Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. To find out how many bottles Pamela needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen required by the amount in each bottle:
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total sunscreen}}{\text{ounces per bottle}} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
   \]

Thus, Pamela will need to pack a total of 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.

**Final Answer**: 4 bottles of sunscreen.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many ounces of sunscreen Pamela uses per day
* She uses 1 ounce every hour
* She's outside 4 hours per day
* Daily usage = 1 oz × 4 hours = 4 ounces per day

2. Now let's calculate total ounces needed for the vacation
* Vacation is 8 days
* Total ounces = Daily usage × Number of days
* Total ounces = 4 ounces × 8 days = 32 ounces

3. Finally, let's calculate how many 8-ounce bottles thi...
