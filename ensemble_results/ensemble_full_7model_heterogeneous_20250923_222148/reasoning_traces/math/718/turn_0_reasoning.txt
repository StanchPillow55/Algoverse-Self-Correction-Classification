=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps based on the percentages given and calculate the number of people at each stage of the hiring process.

1. **Calculate the number of people who receive interviews:**
   - Total applicants = 100
   - Percentage who receive interviews = 30%
   - Number of people who receive interviews = 30% of 100

   \[
   \text{Number of interviews} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of people who receive job offers:**
   - Percentage of those interviewed who receive job offers = 20%
   - Number of people who receive job offers = 20% of the number of interviews

   \[
   \text{Number of job offers} = 30 \times 0.20 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people who accept the job offers:**
   - Percentage of those who receive job offers that accept the position = 1/3
   - Number of people who accept the position = (1/3) of the number of job offers

   \[
   \text{Number of acceptances} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- 100 applicants → 30 receive interviews → 6 receive job offers → 2 accept the position.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\] 

This means that 2 people accept the job position at Google.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the process step by step, calculating the number of people at each stage of the hiring process.

1. **Calculate the number of people who receive interviews:**

   We start with 100 applicants. According to the problem, only 30% of these applicants receive interviews.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Start with initial number of applicants:
* Total applicants = 100 people

2. Calculate how many receive interviews (30% of applicants):
* 30% = 0.30
* Number receiving interviews = 100 × 0.30 = 30 people

3. Calculate how many receive job offers (20% of those interviewed):
* 20% = 0.20
* Number receiving offers = 30 × 0.20 = 6 people

4. Calculate how many accept the position (1/3 of those offered):
* One third =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Find the number of people who receive interviews

We know that 30% of the people who apply for the job receive interviews. To find this number, we multiply the total number of applicants by 30%.

100 applicants * 30% = 30 people receive interviews

Step 2: Find the number of people who receive a job offer

We know that 20% of the people who receive interviews get a job offer. To find this number, we multiply the number of people who received interviews by 20%.

30...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 100 people apply for the job at Google.
   * 30% of the applicants receive interviews.
   * 20% of those interviewed receive a job offer.
   * 1/3 of the people who receive a job offer accept the position.

2. Calculate the number of people who receive interviews:
   * 30% of 100 = 0.3 × 100 = 30 people
   So, 30 people out of the 100 applicants receive interviews.
