=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many votes the loser received in the election for class representative.

1. **Identify the total number of votes**: 
   The problem states that the total number of students who voted is 80.

2. **Determine the number of votes the winner received**: 
   According to the problem, the winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes. We can calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total votes}
   \]

   Substituting the total votes:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{3 \times 80}{4} = \frac{240}{4} = 60
   \]

   So, the winner received 60 votes.

3. **Calculate the number of votes the loser received**: 
   Since the total number of votes is 80, we can find the number of votes the loser received by subtracting the number of votes the winner received from the total votes:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The number of votes the loser received is \( \boxed{20} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of votes the winner got and then subtract it from the total number of votes to find the number of votes the loser got.

Given information:
- The winner got 3/4 of the votes.
- The total number of students who voted in the class was 80.

Step 1: Find the number of votes the winner got.
Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can calculate the number of votes the winner got as follows:
Number of votes ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many votes the losing candidate received in the class representative election. We know the following:

- The total number of students who voted is 80.
- The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the number of votes the winner received:**

   The winner received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. To find out how many votes this is, we multiply the tot...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total number of students who voted = 80
* Winner got 3/4 of the votes
* We need to find votes for the loser

2. Let's find how many votes the winner got:
* Winner's votes = 3/4 × 80
* Winner's votes = 60 votes

3. Since there are only two candidates:
* Total votes = Winner's votes + Loser's votes
* 80 = 60 + Loser's votes
* Loser's votes = 80 - 60
* Loser's votes = 20 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we multiply the total number of votes by 3/4.

80 votes * 3/4 = 60 votes

This means the winner got 60 votes.

To find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

80 votes - 60 votes = 20 votes

So, the loser got 20 votes.

Therefore, the final answer is that the loser got 20 votes.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to calculate the number of votes the losing candidate received.

Given:
- There are two candidates running for class representative.
- The winner received 3/4 of the total votes.
- The total number of students who voted was 80.

Step 1: Calculate the number of votes the winning candidate received.
Winning candidate's votes = 3/4 × Total votes
Winning candidate's votes = 3/4...
