=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the value of the boat at the end of each year step by step.

1. **Initial Value of the Boat**: 
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Depreciation in the First Year**:
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year. To find the amount of depreciation:
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year 1} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we subtract this depreciation from the initial value to find the value at the end of the first year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 1} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Depreciation in the Second Year**:
   In the second year, the boat again depreciates by 30%, but this time it is based on the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year 2} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the first year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 2} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Depreciation in the Third Year**:
   In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, based on the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation for Year 3} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the second year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 3} = 4410 - 882 = 3528 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final Value of the Boat**:
   After three years of depreciation, the final value of the boat is:
   \[
   \text{Final Value} = 3528 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each year of depreciation.

Given information:
- Gary bought a boat for $9000.
- The first year, the boat depreciated by 30%.
- The second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%.
- The third year, the boat depreciated by 20%.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the boat after the first year.
Initial value of the boat = $9000
Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 × $9...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we need to apply the depreciation rates sequentially for each year. Let's break this down step by step:

### Initial Value
The initial value of the boat is $9000.

### Year 1 Depreciation
In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30%. To find the depreciation amount for the first year, we calculate 30% of $9000:

\[
\text{Depreciation for Year 1} = 0.30 \times 9000 = 2700
\]

Subtract this depreciatio...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Starting value: $9000

Year 1: 30% depreciation
* 30% = 0.30
* Depreciation amount = $9000 × 0.30 = $2700
* Value after year 1 = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Year 2: 30% depreciation
* 30% of $6300 = $6300 × 0.30 = $1890
* Value after year 2 = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Year 3: 20% depreciation
* 20% of $4410 = $4410 × 0.20 = $882
* Value after year 3 = $4410 - $882 = $3528

Alternative method to verify:
Starting with $9000:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The boat was purchased for $9000. 

In the first year, it depreciated 30%, so it lost 30/100 * 9000 = $2700 in value. 
So at the end of the first year, the boat is worth 9000 - 2700 = $6300.

In the second year, it depreciated another 30%, so it lost 30/100 * 6300 = $1890 in value. 
So at the end of the second year, the boat is worth 6300 - 1890 = $4410.

In the third year, it depreciated 20%, so it lost 20/100 * 4410 = $882 in value. 
So at the end of the third year, the...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Gary bought a boat for $9000.
   * In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%.
   * In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%.
   * In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%.

2. Calculate the boat's value after the first year:
   * The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year.
   * To calculate the depreciation amount: $9000 × 30% = $9000 × 0.3...
