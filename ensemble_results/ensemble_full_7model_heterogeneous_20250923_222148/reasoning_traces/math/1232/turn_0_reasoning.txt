=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by identifying the key pieces of information given:

1. Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
2. After giving some pomelos away, she is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the original amount.

Let's break down the steps to find out how many pomelos Eve gave away.

**Step 1: Calculate how many pomelos Eve has left.**

Since Eve is left with \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pomelos she originally had, we can calculate this amount:

\[
\text{Pomelos left} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pomelos left} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.

**Step 2: Determine how many pomelos Eve gave away.**

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she has left from the original amount:

\[
\text{Pomelos given away} = \text{Original pomelos} - \text{Pomelos left}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Pomelos given away} = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

**Final Answer:**

Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
- After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of the original amount.

Step 1: Find the number of pomelos Eve has left after giving some to her friend.
1/4 of the original amount = 1/4 × 20 = 5 pomelos

Step 2: Find the number of pomelos Eve gave away.
Original amount - Amount left = Amount given away
20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

Therefore, Ev...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pomelos Eve gave away. We know the following:

1. Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos.
2. After giving some away, she is left with 1/4 of the original number of pomelos.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Determine how many pomelos Eve has left.**

Eve is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had. Since she originally had 20 pomelos, we calculate 1/4 of 20:

\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Eve started with 20 pomelos
* She has 1/4 of the original amount left
* We need to find how many she gave away

2. Calculate how many pomelos Eve has left:
* 1/4 of 20 = 20 × (1/4) = 5 pomelos remaining

3. To find how many pomelos Eve gave away:
* Original amount - Remaining amount = Amount given away
* 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos given away

Therefore, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

To...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving away some, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos she was left with, we multiply the original amount by 1/4:

20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

So, Eve was left with 5 pomelos.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she was left with from the original amount:

20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Eve started with 20 pieces of pomelos.
   * After giving some pomelos to her friend, Eve is left with 1/4 of her original amount.

2. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve has left:
   * Eve's remaining pomelos = 1/4 of her original amount
   * 1/4 of 20 = 20 ÷ 4 = 5
   So, Eve has 5 pomelos left.

3. Calculate the number of pomelos Eve gave away:
   * Eve's given ...
