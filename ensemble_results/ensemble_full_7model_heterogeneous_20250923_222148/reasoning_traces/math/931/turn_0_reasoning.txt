=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to define the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean using variables and then set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( P \) = age of Peter
- \( A \) = age of Paul
- \( J \) = age of Jean

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than Jean:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now we have three equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( A = J + 10 \) (Equation 2)
3. \( P = A + J \) (Equation 3)

### Step 1: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1

Substituting \( A \) from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
\[
P + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P + 2J + 10 = 100
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
P + 2J = 90 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute Equation 2 into Equation 3

Now, substitute \( A \) from Equation 2 into Equation 3:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
P = 2J + 10 \quad \text{(Equation 5)}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute Equation 5 into Equation 4

Now we can substitute Equation 5 into Equation 4:
\[
(2J + 10) + 2J = 90
\]
Combining like terms gives:
\[
4J + 10 = 90
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides results in:
\[
4J = 80
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
\[
J = 20
\]

### Step 4: Find Paul's Age

Now that we have Jean's age, we can find Paul's age using Equation 2:
\[
A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
\]

### Step 5: Find Peter's Age

Finally, we can find Peter's age using Equation 3:
\[
P = A + J = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean are:
- Peter: 50 years
- Paul: 30 years
- Jean: 20 years

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Peter's age is } \boxed{50} \text{ years old.}
\]

Let:
- \( P \) = age of Peter
- \( A \) = age of Paul
- \( J \) = age of Jean

From the problem, we know the following:

1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
- Paul is 10 years older than Jean.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.

Step 1: Let's assign variables to represent the ages of each person.
Let's say:
- Peter's age = x
- Paul's age = x + 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean)
- Jean's age = x - 10 (since Paul is 10 years older than Jean)

Step 2: Writ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for Peter's age.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( Pa \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years.
2. Paul is 10 years older than John.
3. Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

From the first piece of information, we can write t...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Let's define variables:
* Let p = Peter's age
* Let P = Paul's age
* Let J = John's age

Given information:
1. Peter + Paul + Jean = 100
2. Paul is 10 years older than John, so P = J + 10
3. Peter's age equals sum of Paul and John, so p = P + J

Step 1: Use fact #2 to express Paul's age in terms of John
* P = J + 10

Step 2: Use fact #3 and substitute Paul's expression
* p = P + J
* p = (J + 10) + J
* p = 2J + 10

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and John as P, Pa, and J respectively. 

From the problem, we know that:

P + Pa + J = 100 (equation 1)

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so:

Pa = J + 10 (equation 2)

And we know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so:

P = Pa + J (equation 3)

We can substitute equation 2 into equation 3 to get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

And we can substitute equation 2 into equation 1 to get:

P + (...

- The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.
- Paul is 10 years older than John.
- Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.

Step 1: Let's express Paul's age in terms of John's age.
Paul's age = John's age + 10

Step 2: Express Peter's age in terms of John's age.
Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age
