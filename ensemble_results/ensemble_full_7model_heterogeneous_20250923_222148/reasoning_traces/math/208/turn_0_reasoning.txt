=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down day by day and calculate the total number of cakes Rose bought.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cakes bought on Monday.**
- On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cakes bought on Tuesday.**
- On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday.
- The number of cakes bought on Tuesday = 3 × (number of cakes bought on Monday)
- Number of cakes bought on Tuesday = 3 × 4 = 12 cakes.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of cakes bought on Wednesday.**
- On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.
- The number of cakes bought on Wednesday = 5 × (number of cakes bought on Tuesday)
- Number of cakes bought on Wednesday = 5 × 12 = 60 cakes.

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cakes bought over the three days.**
- Total cakes = (cakes bought on Monday) + (cakes bought on Tuesday) + (cakes bought on Wednesday)
- Total cakes = 4 + 12 + 60.

Now, we will perform the addition:
- 4 + 12 = 16
- 16 + 60 = 76

Thus, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is **76**.

**Final Answer: 76 cakes.**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cakes on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 cakes on Wednesday.

To find the total number of cakes she bought, we add the number of cakes she bought each day. So, 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = <<4+12+60=76>>76 cakes.
