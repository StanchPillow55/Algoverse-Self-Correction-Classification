=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School last Friday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of teachers who were not sick.**
   - Total number of teachers = 82
   - Number of sick teachers = 13
   - Therefore, the number of teachers who were not sick can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of teachers not sick} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Sick teachers} = 82 - 13 = 69
     \]

2. **Add the number of substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were not sick.**
   - Number of substitute teachers = 9
   - Now, we will add the number of teachers who were not sick to the number of substitute teachers to find the total number of teachers present at school that day:
     \[
     \text{Total teachers at school} = \text{Teachers not sick} + \text{Substitute teachers} = 69 + 9 = 78
     \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - The total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday was 78.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Total number of teachers normally = 82
* Number of teachers sick = 13
* Number of substitute teachers = 9

2. To find teachers present that day:
* Start with total teachers (82)
* Subtract sick teachers (13)
* Add substitute teachers (9)

3. Let's calculate:
* 82 - 13 = 69 (regular teachers who were not sick)
* 69 + 9 = 78 (add substitute teachers)

Therefore:
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many teachers were not sick. We do this by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers. 

So, 82 teachers - 13 sick teachers = 69 teachers who were not sick.

Then, we add the number of substitute teachers who were called in to help to the number of teachers who were not sick. 

So, 69 teachers + 9 substitute teachers = 78 teachers.

Therefore, there were 78 teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday.
