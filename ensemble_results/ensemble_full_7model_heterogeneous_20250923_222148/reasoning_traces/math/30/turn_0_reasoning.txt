=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we start by letting Darrell's age be represented as \( 7x \) and Allen's age as \( 11x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier. This representation is based on the given ratio of their ages, which is 7:11.

Next, we know that the total of their ages is 162. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
7x + 11x = 162
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
18x = 162
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 18:

\[
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
\]

Now that we have the value of \( x \), we can find Darrell's and Allen's current ages:

- Darrell's age:
\[
7x = 7 \times 9 = 63
\]

- Allen's age:
\[
11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
\]

Now we have their current ages: Darrell is 63 years old and Allen is 99 years old.

Next, we need to calculate Allen's age 10 years from now. We simply add 10 years to his current age:

\[
\text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = 109
\]

Thus, Allen's age 10 years from now will be:

\[
\boxed{109}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Allen's age based on the given information and then calculate his age 10 years from now.

Given information:
- The ratio of Darrell and Allen's ages is 7:11.
- The total age of Darrell and Allen is 162.

Step 1: Find Darrell and Allen's current ages.
Let Darrell's age be x and Allen's age be y.
According to the given ratio, we have:
x : y = 7 : 11
x = 7k and y = 11k, where k is a constant.

The total age of Darre...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen given their age ratio and the sum of their ages, and then calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( D \) be Darrell's current age and \( A \) be Allen's current age. According to the problem, their ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
\]

### Step 2: Express Ages in Terms of a Common Variable
We can expres...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's understand what we know:
   * Darrell and Allen's ages are in ratio 7:11
   * Their total age is 162
   * We need to find Allen's age after 10 years

2) Let's solve for their current ages first
   * If ratio is 7:11, let's call one part 'x'
   * Darrell's age = 7x
   * Allen's age = 11x
   * Total age = 162
   * So: 7x + 11x = 162
   * 18x = 162
   * x = 162 รท 18
   * x = 9

3) Now we can find their current...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that for every 7 years of Darrell's age, Allen is 11 years old. 

The total of the ratio is 7 + 11 = 18 parts.

The problem also states that their total age now is 162 years. This means that each part of the ratio is equal to 162 years divided by 18 parts, which is 9 years per part.

Since Allen's age is represented by 11 parts of the ratio, his current age is 11 parts times 9 years per ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11.
   * Their total age now is 162.
   * We need to find Allen's age 10 years from now.

2. Let's express their current ages using the ratio:
   * Let Darrell's current age be 7x and Allen's current age be 11x, where x is a number we'll solve for.

3. Calculate the value of x using the total age:
   * Total age = Da...
