=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much all three girls have combined, we will first determine how much each girl has individually based on the information provided.

1. **Carmen's Amount**:
   - Carmen has $100.

2. **Samantha's Amount**:
   - We know that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Therefore, we can calculate Samantha's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Samantha's Amount} = \text{Carmen's Amount} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125
   \]

3. **Daisy's Amount**:
   - Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. We can calculate Daisy's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Daisy's Amount} = \text{Samantha's Amount} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175
   \]

4. **Total Amount Combined**:
   - Now, we will find the total amount of money that all three girls have combined by adding their individual amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Carmen's Amount} + \text{Samantha's Amount} + \text{Daisy's Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the amounts we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 100 + 125 + 175
   \]

5. **Calculating the Total**:
   - Now, we will perform the addition:
   \[
   100 + 125 = 225
   \]
   \[
   225 + 175 = 400
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have combined is **$400**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carmen has $100
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha

Step 1: Calculate how much Samantha has.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen.
Samantha's amount = Carmen's amount + $25
Samantha's amount = $100 + $25 = $125

Step 2: Calculate how much Daisy has.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha.
Daisy's amount = Samantha's amount + $50
Daisy's amount = $125 + $50 = $17...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money each of the three girls has and then find the total amount they have combined.

1. **Determine how much money Carmen has:**
   - Carmen has $100.

2. **Determine how much money Samantha has:**
   - Samantha has $25 more than Carmen.
   - Since Carmen has $100, we add $25 to this amount to find out how much Samantha has:
     \[
     100 + 25 = 125
     \]
   - Therefore, Samantha has $125.

3. **Determine how muc...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much Carmen has:
* Carmen = $100

2. Next, let's calculate how much Samantha has:
* Samantha = Carmen + $25
* Samantha = $100 + $25
* Samantha = $125

3. Now, let's calculate how much Daisy has:
* Daisy = Samantha + $50
* Daisy = $125 + $50
* Daisy = $175

4. Finally, let's add all three amounts together:
* Total = Carmen + Samantha + Daisy
* Total = $100 + $125 + $175
* Total = $400

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much money Samantha and Daisy have.

We know that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Since Carmen has $100, we add $25 to Carmen's amount to find out how much Samantha has:

$100 (Carmen's amount) + $25 = $125

So, Samantha has $125.

Next, we know that Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. Since Samantha has $125, we add $50 to Samantha's amount to find out how much Daisy has:

$125 (Samantha's amount) + $50 = $175

So, Daisy has $175.
