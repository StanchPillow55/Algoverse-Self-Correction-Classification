=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of hot dogs each person ate and then comparing the amounts.

1. **Determine how many hot dogs Luke ate:**
   - According to the problem, Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 2
   \]

2. **Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate:**
   - The problem states that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, we can calculate the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by multiplying the number of hot dogs Luke ate by 3.
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = 3 \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate how many hot dogs John ate:**
   - The problem states that John ate half the amount that Thomas ate. We can find the number of hot dogs John ate by dividing the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2.
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Hot dogs eaten by Thomas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:**
   - Now we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. We do this by subtracting the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number of hot dogs John ate.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Hot dogs eaten by John} - \text{Hot dogs eaten by Luke} = 3 - 2 = 1
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
- Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.
- John ate half the amount Thomas ate.

Step 1: Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate.
Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × Luke's hot dogs
Thomas's hot dogs = 3 × 2 = 6 hot dogs

Step 2: Calculate how many hot dogs John ate.
John ate half the amount Thomas ate.
John's hot dogs = 1/2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hot dogs each person ate and then compare the amounts eaten by John and Luke.

1. **Determine how many hot dogs Thomas ate:**
   - Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
   - Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.
   - To find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate, we multiply the number of hot dogs Luke ate by 3:
     \[
     \text{Hot dogs Thomas ate} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

2. **Determine how many hot dogs John ate:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Luke ate 2 hot dogs
* Thomas ate 3 times more than Luke
* John ate half of what Thomas ate

2. Let's find how many hot dogs Thomas ate:
* Thomas = 3 × Luke's amount
* Thomas = 3 × 2 = 6 hot dogs

3. Now let's find how many hot dogs John ate:
* John = ½ × Thomas's amount
* John = ½ × 6 = 3 hot dogs

4. To find how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:
* Difference = John's am...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since we know that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of hot dogs Luke ate by 3.

Luke ate 2 hot dogs, so:

2 hot dogs * 3 = 6 hot dogs

So, Thomas ate 6 hot dogs.

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. We know that John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, so we can calculate this by dividing the number of hot dogs Thomas ate by 2.

6 hot ...
