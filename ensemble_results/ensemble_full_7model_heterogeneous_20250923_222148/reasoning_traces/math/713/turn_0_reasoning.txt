=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area to be covered**: 
   - First, we need to find out how much area two-thirds of the bathroom is. 
   - The total area of the bathroom is 36 square feet. 
   - To find two-thirds of this area, we can multiply the total area by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

   - Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Area to be covered} = \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of tiles needed**:
   - We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. 
   - To find the total number of tiles needed for the area we just calculated (24 sq ft), we multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot:

   \[
   \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft}
   \]

   - Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \times 24 = 576 \text{ tiles}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Mr. Boarden will need a total of **576 mosaic tiles** to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{576}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* The bathroom is 36 square feet total
* Mr Boarden needs to cover two thirds (2/3) of the bathroom
* Each square foot needs 24 mosaic tiles

2. Let's calculate how many square feet need to be covered:
* Area to be covered = 2/3 × 36 sq ft
* Area to be covered = (2 × 36) ÷ 3
* Area to be covered = 72 ÷ 3
* Area to be covered = 24 square feet

3. Now calculate total tiles...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many square feet two thirds of the bathroom is. 

We do this by multiplying the total square footage of the bathroom (36 sq ft) by 2/3:

36 sq ft * 2/3 = 24 sq ft

So, two thirds of the bathroom is 24 square feet.

Next, we need to find out how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden needs to cover this area. 

We do this by multiplying the number of tiles needed per square foot (24 tiles) by the number of square feet (24 sq ft):

24 tiles/sq ft * 24 s...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mr Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot of his bathroom.
   * His bathroom is 36 square feet in total.
   * He wants to cover two thirds of his bathroom with mosaic tiles.

2. Calculate the area of the bathroom that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles:
   * Total bathroom area = 36 sq ft
   * Fraction of the bathroom to be covered = 2/3
   * Ar...
