=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother after buying 20 sacks of rice.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of sacks given away
Goldy gave away:
- 3 sacks to her cousin
- 4 sacks to her brother

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total number of sacks given away:

\[
\text{Total sacks given away} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ sacks}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the rice given away
We know that each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. To find the total weight of the rice given away, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight of each sack:

\[
\text{Total weight given away} = \text{Total sacks given away} \times \text{Weight per sack}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight given away} = 7 \text{ sacks} \times 25 \text{ kg/sack}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total weight given away} = 7 \times 25 = 175 \text{ kg}
\]

### Final Answer
Goldy gave a total of **175 kilograms** of rice to her cousin and brother.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice.
- She gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
- She gave 4 sacks to her brother.
- There are 25 kilograms of rice per sack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of kilograms of rice Goldy bought.
Total number of sacks = 20
Kilograms of rice per sack = 25 kg
Total kilograms of rice bought = 20 sacks × 25 kg/sack = 500 kg

Step 2: Calculate the number of kilograms of rice Goldy...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of sacks given to each person:**
   - Goldy gave 3 sacks to her cousin.
   - Goldy gave 4 sacks to her brother.

2. **Determine the total number of sacks given away:**
   - Total sacks given = Sacks given to cousin + Sacks given to brother
   - Total sacks given = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

3...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice
* She gave 3 sacks to her cousin
* She gave 4 sacks to her brother
* Each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice

2. To find total kilograms given away:
* First, calculate total sacks given away
* Sacks to cousin + Sacks to brother = 3 + 4 = 7 sacks total

3. Calculate total kilograms:
* Kilograms per sack × Total sacks given away
* 25 k...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Goldy gave away a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. This means she gave away a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 sacks of rice.

Since each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms, the total weight of the rice she gave away is 7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = <<7*25=175>>175 kilograms.

So, Goldy gave away 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the final answer.

Given:
- Goldy bought 20 sacks of rice.
- She gave 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother.
- Each sack contains 25 kilograms of rice.

Step 1: Determine the number of sacks Goldy gave away.
Sacks given to cousin = 3
Sacks given to brother = 4
Total sa...
