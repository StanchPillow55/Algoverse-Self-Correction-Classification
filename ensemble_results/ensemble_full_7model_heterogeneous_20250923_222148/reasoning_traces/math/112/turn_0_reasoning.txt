=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of teachers**: There are 4 teachers.

2. **Identify the number of lessons per teacher**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

3. **Calculate the total number of lessons in a day**:
   \[
   \text{Total lessons} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Lessons per teacher}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lessons} = 4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons}
   \]

4. **Identify how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson**: The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

5. **Calculate the total number of cleanings in a day**:
   \[
   \text{Total cleanings} = \text{Total lessons} \times \text{Cleanings per lesson}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cleanings} = 8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings}
   \]

Thus, the whiteboard is cleaned a total of 24 times in a day.

**Final Answer**: The whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day.

Given information:
- There are 4 teachers who share the classroom.
- Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
- The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

Step 1: Find the total number of lessons in a day.
Total number of lessons per day = Number of teachers × Number of lessons per teacher
Total number of lessons per day = 4 × 2 = 8 lessons

Step 2: Fi...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day based on the given conditions.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify the number of teachers and lessons:**
   - There are 4 teachers.
   - Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.

2. **Calculate the total number of lessons per day:**
   - Since each teacher has 2 lessons, and there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons per day is:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* There are 4 teachers
* Each teacher has 2 lessons per day
* The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson

2. Let's calculate the total number of lessons per day:
* Lessons per teacher = 2
* Number of teachers = 4
* Total lessons per day = 2 × 4 = 8 lessons

3. Now calculate how many times the board is cleaned per day:
* Cleanings per lesson = 3
* Total lessons per day ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem can be solved by simple multiplication. 

First, we need to find out how many lessons are there in a day. Since each teacher has 2 lessons per day and there are 4 teachers, the total number of lessons in a day is 2 lessons/teacher * 4 teachers = 8 lessons.

Next, we need to find out how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day. Since the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson and there are 8 lessons in a day, the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times/lesson * 8...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 4 teachers who share the classroom.
   * Each teacher has 2 lessons per day.
   * The whiteboard is used in each lesson.
   * The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson.

2. Calculate the total number of lessons per day:
   * Number of teachers = 4
   * Lessons per teacher per day = 2
   * Total lessons per day = Number of teachers × Lessons per teacher per...
