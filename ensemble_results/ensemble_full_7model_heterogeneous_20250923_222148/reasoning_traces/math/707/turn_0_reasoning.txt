=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage of the total water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

1. **Identify the total water usage by Colorado City**:
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Calculate the industrial water usage**:
   - Out of the water that Colorado City uses (which is 40% of the river's total water), 80% is used for industrial purposes.
   - To find the percentage of the total river water that is used for industrial purposes by Colorado City, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Industrial water usage} = 40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 \text{ or } 32\%
     \]
   - This means that 32% of the total water from the Colorado River is used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the non-industrial water usage**:
   - Since Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water in total, and 32% of that is for industrial purposes, we can find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes by subtracting the industrial usage from the total usage:
     \[
     \text{Non-industrial water usage} = \text{Total usage} - \text{Industrial usage} = 40\% - 32\% = 8\%
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes is:
     \[
     \boxed{8\%}
     \]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. This means that out of the total water available in the river, 40% is allocated to Colorado City.

2. **Determine the percentage of ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * Colorado City uses 40% of the river's water
   * 80% of the city's portion is used for industrial purposes

2) To find water used for non-industrial purposes:
   * If 80% is industrial, then 100% - 80% = 20% is non-industrial
   * This 20% is of the city's portion (40% of total)

3) Calculate the percentage of total river water used for non-industrial purposes:
   * 20% of...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much water is used by the city for industrial purposes. 

We know that Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. If 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, we can calculate the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes by multiplying these two percentages together.

0.40 (percentage of total water used by the city) * 0.80 (percentage of that water used for industrial purposes) = 0.32 or ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out what percent of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

Given:
- Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
- 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of the river's water used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.
Industrial water usage = 80% of 40%
