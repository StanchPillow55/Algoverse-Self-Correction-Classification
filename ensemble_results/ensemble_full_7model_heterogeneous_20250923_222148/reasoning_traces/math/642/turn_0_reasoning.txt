=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of James's new wardrobe, we will break down the costs of each item he purchased and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Suits:**
   - James buys 10 suits.
   - Each suit costs $750.
   - Total cost for suits = Number of suits × Cost per suit
   \[
   \text{Total cost for suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
   \]

2. **Cost of Dress Pants:**
   - James buys 10 dress pants.
   - The cost of each dress pant is \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the cost of a suit.
   - Cost of each dress pant = \( \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150 \)
   - Total cost for dress pants = Number of dress pants × Cost per dress pant
   \[
   \text{Total cost for dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
   \]

3. **Cost of Dress Shirts:**
   - James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit.
   - Since he has 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts = 3 shirts/suit × 10 suits = 30 shirts.
   - Each dress shirt costs $60.
   - Total cost for dress shirts = Number of dress shirts × Cost per dress shirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the Wardrobe:**
   - Now we will sum the total costs of suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for suits} + \text{Total cost for dress pants} + \text{Total cost for dress shirts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10800
   \]

Thus, the total cost of James's new wardrobe is **$10,800**.
