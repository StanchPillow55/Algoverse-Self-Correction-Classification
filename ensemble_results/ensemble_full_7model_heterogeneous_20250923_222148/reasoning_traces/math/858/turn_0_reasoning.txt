=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of how many people are infected after three days, we can break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Condition**: We start with 10 infected people.

2. **Daily Infection Rate**: Each infected person infects 6 new people every day.

3. **Calculating Infections Day by Day**:
   - **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.
   - **Day 1**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 1} = 10 \times 6 = 60
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 1:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 10 + 60 = 70
     \]

   - **Day 2**: Now, we have 70 infected people (the original 10 plus the 60 new infections). Each of these 70 people infects 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 2} = 70 \times 6 = 420
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 2:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 70 + 420 = 490
     \]

   - **Day 3**: Now, we have 490 infected people. Each of these 490 people infects 6 new people.
     \[
     \text{New infections on Day 3} = 490 \times 6 = 2940
     \]
     Total infected by the end of Day 3:
     \[
     \text{Total infected} = 490 + 2940 = 3430
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**: After three days, the total number of infected people is:
   \[
   \text{Total infected after 3 days} = 3430
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3430}
\]

2. **Daily Infection Rate**: Each infected person infects 6 new people every day.

3. **Calculating Infections Day by Day**:
   - **Day 0**: Initially, there are 10 infected people.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to understand the exponential growth of the infection over time.

Given information:
- Initially, 10 people are infected.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to find the number of people infected after 3 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people infected on the first day.
Initial number of infected people = 10
Each infected person infects 6 others
Number of people infected on the first day = ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern of infection spread over the given days. We start with an initial number of infected people and calculate how the infection spreads each day.

**Day 0: Initial Infection**
- Initially, 10 people are infected.

**Day 1:**
- Each of these 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Therefore, the number of new infections on Day 1 is \(10 \times 6 = 60\).
- Total infected people by the end of Day 1 = Initial infected + New...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Starting point:
* Day 0: 10 infected people

Day 1:
* Each of the 10 people infects 6 new people
* New infections = 10 × 6 = 60 new people
* Total after Day 1 = Original 10 + 60 new = 70 people

Day 2:
* Each of the 70 people infects 6 new people
* New infections = 70 × 6 = 420 new people
* Total after Day 2 = Previous 70 + 420 new = 490 people

Day 3:
* Each of the 490 people infects 6 new people
* New infections =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): This problem can be solved by using the concept of geometric progression. In a geometric progression, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the common ratio is 6 (each infected person infects 6 others), and the first term is 10 (the initial number of infected people).

Day 0: 10 people are infected (10 * 6^0 = 10)
Day 1: 10 people infect 6 each, so 60 people are infected (10 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll calculate the number of newly infected people each day and keep a running total.

Given:
- The plague starts by infecting 10 people.
- Each infected person infects 6 others every day.
- We want to know the total number of infected people after 3 days.

Day 0:
- Initially infected people = 10
- Total infected people = 10

Day 1:
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
- Newly infected peop...
