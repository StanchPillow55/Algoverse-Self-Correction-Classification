=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to break the problem down into two parts: the fireworks from the city's display and the fireworks that Hannah sets off in her backyard.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks from the city's display.

The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. We can calculate the total number of fireworks from the city as follows:

\[
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Fireworks per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = 15 \times 20 = 300
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many of the city's fireworks Hannah can see.

Hannah can see 40% of the total fireworks from the city. We calculate this by taking 40% of the total number of fireworks:

\[
\text{Fireworks Hannah can see} = 0.40 \times \text{Total fireworks from the city}
\]
\[
\text{Fireworks Hannah can see} = 0.40 \times 300 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah sets off in her backyard.

Hannah sets off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each. We calculate the total number of fireworks she sets off as follows:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Fireworks per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah sees.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah sees, we add the number of fireworks she can see from the city to the number of fireworks she sets off:

\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sees} = \text{Fireworks Hannah can see} + \text{Total fireworks Hannah sets off}
\]
\[
\text{Total fireworks Hannah sees} = 120 + 15 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Hannah will see a total of **135 fireworks**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each.
- Hannah's house is at a right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks.
- Hannah will also set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each in her backyard.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks set off by the city.
Total fireworks set off by the city = 15 boxes × 20 fireworks per box = 300 fireworks

Step 2: Calculate the number of fi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, both from the city's display and from her own backyard. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Fireworks in the City's Display

The city is setting off 15 boxes of fireworks, with each box containing 20 fireworks. To find the total number of fireworks in the city's display, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of fireworks per...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total fireworks from the city display:
* 15 boxes × 20 fireworks per box
* = 300 total city fireworks

2. Hannah can only see 40% of the city fireworks:
* 40% = 0.40
* 300 × 0.40 
* = 120 city fireworks visible to Hannah

3. Now let's calculate Hannah's backyard fireworks:
* 3 boxes × 5 fireworks per box
* = 15 backyard fireworks

4. Since these are in Hannah's backyard, she'll see 100%...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is going to set off. We do this by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box. 

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Next, we need to find out how many of these fireworks Hannah will be able to see. We do this by multiplying the total number of fireworks by the percentage that Hannah can see.

300 fireworks * 40% = 120 fireworks

Then, we need to find out how many fireworks Hannah ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Find the total number of fireworks the city will set off:
   * The city has 15 boxes of fireworks
   * Each box contains 20 fireworks
   * Total city fireworks = 15 × 20 = 300 fireworks

2. Calculate the number of city fireworks Hannah will see:
   * Hannah can see 40% of the city's fireworks
   * To find 40%, we multiply the total by 0.4 (which is 40/100)
   * City fireworks Hannah sees = 300 × 0.4...
