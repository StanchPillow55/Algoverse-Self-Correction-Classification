=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many.

**Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.**

Since Edgar's brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar, we can calculate the number of pretzels his brother eats in a day as follows:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Pretzels eaten by Edgar per day}
\]

Substituting the number of pretzels Edgar eats:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = 9
\]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels each day.

**Step 2: Calculate how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.**

Now, we need to find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week (7 days). We can do this by multiplying the number of pretzels he eats in a day by the number of days in a week:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = \text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} \times 7
\]

Substituting the daily amount:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 9 \times 7
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother in a week} = 63
\]

**Final Answer:**

Edgar's brother eats **63 pretzels** in a week.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.

Step 1: Find how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day.
Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, we can divide Edgar's daily intake by 2 to find his brother's daily intake.
Edgar's daily intake = 18 pretzels
Edgar's brother's daily intake = 18 ÷ 2 = 9 pretzels

Step 2: Find how many pretz...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day:**

   Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in one day, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Pre...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats per day
   * Edgar eats 18 pretzels per day
   * His brother eats 1/2 as many
   * So: 18 ÷ 2 = 9 pretzels per day for the brother

2. Now, to find how many pretzels the brother eats in a week
   * There are 7 days in a week
   * Brother eats 9 pretzels each day
   * So: 9 pretzels × 7 days = 63 pretzels per week

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. If his brother eats half as many, that means his brother eats 18/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

There are 7 days in a week. So, if Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day, in a week he eats 9*7 = 63 pretzels.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.

Given:
- Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.
- Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.
Edgar's brother's daily pretzels = 1/2 × Edgar's daily pretzels
Edgar's brother's daily pretzels = 1/2 × 18
Edgar's brother's daily pretzels = 9

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 p...
