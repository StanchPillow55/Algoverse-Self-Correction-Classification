=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of people at the beach for each day of the week and then find the total number of people Conor saw.

1. **Day 1**: 
   - The number of people at the beach is given as 50.

2. **Day 2**: 
   - On the second day, there are 20 more people than on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of people on Day 2 is:
     \[
     50 + 20 = 70
     \]

3. **Day 3**: 
   - On the third day, the total number of people is twice the number that were there on the second day.
   - Thus, the number of people on Day 3 is:
     \[
     2 \times 70 = 140
     \]

4. **Days 4 to 7**: 
   - Conor saw an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 7 days in total and we have already accounted for 3 days, there are 4 days left.
   - The total number of people Conor saw on Days 4 to 7 is:
     \[
     60 \times 4 = 240
     \]

5. **Total for the week**: 
   - Now, we will sum the number of people from all 7 days:
     - Day 1: 50
     - Day 2: 70
     - Day 3: 140
     - Days 4 to 7: 240
   - Therefore, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is:
     \[
     50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = 500
     \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is \( \boxed{500} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people at the beach on each day of the week and then add them up to get the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number that were there on the second day.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people Conor saw at the beach each day of the week and then find the total number of people he saw over the entire week.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of people on each day.**

- **Day 1:** Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

- **Day 2:** There were 20 more people than on Day 1.
  \[
  \text{People on Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70
  \]

- **Day 3:** The number of people was twice the number on Day 2.
  \[
  \text{People ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First day: 50 people

2. Second day: 
* 20 more people than first day
* 50 + 20 = 70 people

3. Third day:
* Twice the number from second day
* 70 × 2 = 140 people

4. Rest of the week:
* A week has 7 days
* We know days 1-3, so "rest of week" is days 4-7 (4 days)
* Average of 60 people per day for 4 days
* 60 × 4 = 240 people total for days 4-7

5. Total for the week:
* Add up all days:
* Day 1: 50 people
* Day ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down day by day.

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, 20 more people were present than on the first day. So, the number of people Conor saw on the second day is 50 (from the first day) + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day. So, the number of people Conor saw on the third day is 2 * 70 (from the second day) = 140 people.
