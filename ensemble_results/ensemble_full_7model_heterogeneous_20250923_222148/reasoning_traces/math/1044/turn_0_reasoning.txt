=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights after they have both grown over the summer, we will first convert all measurements to the same unit (inches), calculate their new heights, and then find the difference.

1. **Convert Xavier's height to inches:**
   - Xavier's original height was 4 feet. 
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert feet to inches:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer, so we add this growth to his original height:
     \[
     \text{Xavier's new height} = 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate Cole's new height:**
   - Cole's original height was 50 inches.
   - Cole grew 2 inches over the summer, so we add this growth to his original height:
     \[
     \text{Cole's new height} = 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights:**
   - Now that we have both heights, we can find the difference:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Cole's height} - \text{Xavier's height} = 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
     \]

Thus, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is:

\[
\boxed{1 \text{ inch}}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights after they have both grown over the summer, we will first convert all measurements to the same unit (inches), calculate their new heights, and then find the difference.

1. **Convert Xavier's height to inches:**
   - Xavier's original height was 4 feet. 
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert feet to inches:
     \[
     4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.
- Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer.

Step 1: Convert Xavier's height to inches.
Xavier's height in inches = 4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Step 2: Calculate Xavier's new height after growing 3 inches.
Xavier's new height = 48 inches + 3 inches = 51 inches

Step 3: Calculate Cole's new height after growing 2 inches.
Cole's...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current heights of both Xavier and Cole after their respective growth over the summer, and then find the difference between their heights.

**Step 1: Convert Xavier's initial height to inches.**

Xavier's initial height is given in feet. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we can convert his height from feet to inches:

\[ \text{Xavier's initial height} = 4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

**Step...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's convert Xavier's height to inches to match Cole's measurement
* Xavier was 4 feet tall = 4 × 12 = 48 inches
* Xavier grew 3 inches
* Xavier's new height = 48 + 3 = 51 inches

2. Now let's calculate Cole's new height
* Cole was 50 inches tall
* Cole grew 2 inches
* Cole's new height = 50 + 2 = 52 inches

3. To find the difference between their heights
* Difference = Cole's height - Xavier's height
* D...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth is given in inches, we'll convert Xavier's height to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so Xavier's height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Next, we add the growth over the summer to each of their original heights. Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Finally, we find the difference between...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights after they have grown over the summer.

Given:
- Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.
- Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.

Step 1: Convert Xavier's height from feet to inches.
4 feet = 4 × 12 inches (since 1 foot = 12 inches)
4 feet = 48 inches

Step 2: Add Xavier's growth to his initial height.
Xavier's new height = Initial heigh...
