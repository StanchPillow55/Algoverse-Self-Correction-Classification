Final Answer: To determine how much sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge, we will first calculate the total amount of sugar required for each type of candy separately and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the sugar needed for suckers:**
   - Each batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 8 batches of suckers.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the suckers can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sugar for suckers} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sugar for suckers} = 8 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ ounces/batch} = 240 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the sugar needed for fudge:**
   - Each batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar.
   - Mason is making 1 batch of fudge.
   - Therefore, the total sugar needed for the fudge can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sugar for fudge} = \text{Number of batches} \times \text{Sugar per batch}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sugar for fudge} = 1 \text{ batch} \times 70 \text{ ounces/batch} = 70 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total sugar needed:**
   - Now, we will add the sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together:
     \[
     \text{Total sugar needed} = \text{Sugar for suckers} + \text{Sugar for fudge}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total sugar needed} = 240 \text{ ounces} + 70 \text{ ounces} = 310 \text{ ounces}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of sugar Mason needs to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge is **310 ounces**.

Final answer: **310 ounces**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar to make a batch of suckers.
- Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge.
- Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of sugar needed for the 8 batches of suckers.
Sugar needed for 1 batch of suckers = 30 ounces
Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers = 8 × 30 ounces = 240 ounces

Step 2: Calculat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of sugar Mason needs for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. We will do this by calculating the sugar required for each type of batch separately and then summing the results.

### Step 1: Calculate the sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers

Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers. Therefore, for 8 batches, the calculation is:

\[
\text{Sugar for suckers} = 30 \, \text{ounces/batch} \times...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* 1 batch of suckers needs 30 ounces of sugar
* 1 batch of fudge needs 70 ounces of sugar
* Mason wants to make 8 batches of suckers
* Mason wants to make 1 batch of fudge

2. Calculate sugar needed for suckers:
* Sugar for suckers = 30 ounces × 8 batches
* Sugar for suckers = 240 ounces

3. Calculate sugar needed for fudge:
* Sugar for fudge = 70 ounces × 1 batch
* Sugar for f...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how much sugar Mason needs for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge. 

First, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for the suckers. We know that one batch of suckers requires 30 ounces of sugar. So, for 8 batches, we multiply 30 ounces by 8:

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces

Next, we know that one batch of fudge requires 70 ounces of sugar. Since Mason is only making 1 batch of fudge, he will need:

70 ounces/bat...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers.
   * Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge.
   * We need to find the total amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.

2. Calculate the amount of sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers:
   * Sugar needed for 1 batch of suckers = 30 ounces
   * Sugar needed for 8 batches o...
