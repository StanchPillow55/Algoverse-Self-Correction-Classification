=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry based on the information provided about Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

1. **Determine Gissela's Truck Capacity:**
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

   \[
   \text{Gissela's truck capacity} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Gordy's Truck Capacity:**
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combine the Capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's Trucks:**
   Now, we can find the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks combined:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine Gary's Truck Capacity:**
   We know that when Gary joins Gissela and Gordy, the total capacity of all three trucks combined is 11,600 pounds. We can set up the equation:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela, Gordy, and Gary} = \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   11600 = 8800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]

   To find Gary's truck capacity, we subtract the total capacity of Gissela and Gordy from the total capacity of all three trucks:

   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the amount of gravel that Gary's truck can carry is:

   \[
   \boxed{2800} \text{ pounds}
   \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry based on the information provided about Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

1. **Determine Gissela's Truck Capacity:**
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

   \[
   \text{Gissela's truck capacity} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Gordy's Truck Capacity:**
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capa...

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
- Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
- When all three trucks (Gissela, Gordy, and Gary) are combined, they can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.

Step 1: Calculate the capacity of Gordy's truck.
Gordy's truck capacity = Gissela's truck capacity + 800 pounds
Gordy's truck capacity = 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much gravel each truck can carry and then find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

1. **Identify the capacity of Gissela's truck:**
   - Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

2. **Determine the capacity of Gordy's truck:**
   - Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck can haul \(4,000 + 800 = 4,800\) pounds of gravel.

3. **Determine the combined capacity of al...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds
* Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's
* All three trucks together can haul 11,600 pounds

2. Let's find how much Gordy's truck can haul:
* Gordy's capacity = Gissela's capacity + 800
* Gordy's capacity = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds

3. Now we can find Gary's truck capacity:
* Total capacity = Gissela's + Gordy's + Gary's
...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since we know that Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we add 800 pounds to the 4,000 pounds that Gissela's truck can carry. 

4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Next, let's find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We know that the three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. So, to find out how much Gary's...
