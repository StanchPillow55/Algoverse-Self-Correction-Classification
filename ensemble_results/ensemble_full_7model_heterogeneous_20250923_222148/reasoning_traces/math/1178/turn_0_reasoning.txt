Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Johnny bought based on the information provided about Mike's purchase.

1. **Identify how many face masks Mike bought**:
   - According to the problem, Mike bought 5 face masks.

2. **Determine how many face masks Johnny bought**:
   - The problem states that Johnny bought "2 more than thrice as many as Mike."
   - First, we need to calculate "thrice as many as Mike." Since Mike bought 5 face masks, we calculate:
     \[
     3 \times 5 = 15
     \]
   - Now, we need to find "2 more than" this amount:
     \[
     15 + 2 = 17
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Putting it all together, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Johnny bought } 17 \text{ face masks.}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:

3. Johnny bought 2 more than that amount:
* Johnny's masks = 15 + 2 = 17 masks

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

To verify:
* Mike bought 5 masks...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mike bought 5 face masks.

Thrice as many as Mike bought would be 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 face masks.

Johnny bought 2 more than this, so Johnny bought 15 + 2 = <<15+2=17>>17 face masks.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.
