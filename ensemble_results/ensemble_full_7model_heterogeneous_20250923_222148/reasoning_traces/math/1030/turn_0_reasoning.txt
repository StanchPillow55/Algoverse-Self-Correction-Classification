Final Answer: To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios based on the probabilities given.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher**: There is a 50% chance (0.5 probability) that Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. If this happens, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.

2. **Probability of having the normal teacher**: If there is a 50% chance (0.5 probability) that the normal teacher is present, we need to consider the two scenarios that can occur in this case:
   - **Probability of getting an extension**: There is a 40% chance (0.4 probability) that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus also does not have to turn in his homework.
   - **Probability of not getting an extension**: If the teacher does not give an extension, there is a 60% chance (1 - 0.4 = 0.6 probability) that Marcus will not get an extension. In this case, we need to consider whether Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.

3. **Probability of convincing the teacher**: If the teacher does not give an extension, there is a 20% chance (0.2 probability) that Marcus can convince her to give him a personal extension. This means there is an 80% chance (1 - 0.2 = 0.8 probability) that he will not get an extension and will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's summarize the probabilities:

- **Scenario 1**: Substitute teacher (50% chance) → Marcus does not have to turn in homework.
- **Scenario 2**: Normal teacher (50% chance):
  - **Sub-scenario 2a**: Extension given (40% chance) → Marcus does not have to turn in homework.
  - **Sub-scenario 2b**: No extension given (60% chance):
    - **Sub-sub-scenario 2b1**: Convince teacher (20% chance) → Marcus does not have to turn in homework.
    - **Sub-sub-scenario 2b2**: Cannot convince teacher (80% chance) → Marcus has to turn in homework.

Now, we can calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

1. **Probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present**:
   - Probability of not getting an extension and not convincing the teacher:
   \[
   P(\text{No extension and cannot convince}) = P(\text{Normal teacher}) \times P(\text{No extension}) \times P(\text{Cannot convince})
   \]
   \[
   = 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.24
   \]

2. **Total probability of having to turn in homework**:
   Since Marcus does not have to turn in homework if there is a substitute teacher or if he gets an extension or convinces the teacher, the only scenario where he has to turn in homework is when the normal teacher is present, no extension is given, and he cannot convince the teacher.

Thus, the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is:
\[
P(\text{Has to turn in homework}) = P(\text{Normal teacher}) \times P(\text{No extension}) \times P(\text{Cannot convince}) = 0.24
\]

Finally, to express this as a percentage:
\[
\text{Percentage chance} = 0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{24\%}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

Given information:
- There's a 50% chance that tomorrow Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
- Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
- Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his a...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow. We will consider all possible scenarios and their probabilities.

1. **Probability of having a substitute teacher:**
   - If there is a substitute teacher, the homework will not be collected.
   - The probability of having a substitute teacher is 50% or 0.5.

2. **Probability of having the normal teacher:**
   - If the normal teacher comes in, the probabili...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we're looking for:
   * We want the probability that Marcus will HAVE TO turn in his homework
   * This is the opposite of the probability that he'll get out of turning it in

2) Let's list all the ways Marcus can avoid turning in homework:
   * Substitute teacher (50% chance)
   * Regular teacher gives class extension (40% chance if no sub)
   * Personal excuse works (20% chance if no ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow. This will happen if:

1. His regular teacher comes in (which has a 50% chance of not happening, so a 50% chance of happening).
2. The teacher doesn't give an extension (which has a 40% chance of happening, so a 60% chance of not happening).
3. Marcus can't convince the teacher his dog ate his homework (which has a 20% chance of happeni...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step. To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to consider the probability of each event and its complement (the probability of the event not occurring).

Given:
- 50% chance of a substitute teacher who won't collect homework
- 40% chance of the normal teacher giving everyone an extension
- 20% chance of Marcus convincing the teacher his dog ate his assignment
