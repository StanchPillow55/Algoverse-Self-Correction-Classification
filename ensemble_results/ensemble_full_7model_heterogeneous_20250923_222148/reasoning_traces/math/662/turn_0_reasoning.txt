Final Answer: To find out how much the apple pie cost, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he bought, excluding the apple pie. We will then subtract this total from the overall amount he spent at the grocery store.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each.
   \[
   \text{Cost of chips} = 2 \text{ bags} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/bag} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the bucket of fried chicken:**
   Gus spent $8.00 on the bucket of fried chicken.
   \[
   \text{Cost of fried chicken} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the bottle of soda:**
   Gus spent $1.00 on the bottle of soda.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soda} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased (excluding the apple pie):**
   Now we add the costs of the chips, fried chicken, and soda together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = \text{Cost of chips} + \text{Cost of fried chicken} + \text{Cost of soda}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of the apple pie:**
   Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = \text{Total spent} - \text{Total cost of items}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is **$7.00**. 

Final answer: **$7.00**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total spent = $20.00
* 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each = $2.00 Ã— 2 = $4.00
* Bucket of chicken = $8.00
* Bottle of soda = $1.00
* We need to find the cost of the apple pie

2. Let's add up all the known items:
* Chips: $4.00
* Chicken: $8.00
* Soda: $1.00
* Total of known items = $4.00 + $8.00 + $1.00 = $13.00

3. To find the cost of the apple pie:
* Total spent - Cost of known...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the items that we know the price of. 

Gus bought 2 bags of chips at $2.00 each, so that's 2 * $2.00 = $4.00.

He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8.00 and a bottle of soda for $1.00.

So, the total cost of the chips, chicken, and soda is $4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00.

We know that Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total co...
