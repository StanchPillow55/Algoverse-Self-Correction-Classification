=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the percentage of all the puppies that have spots, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of puppies**:
   - Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.
   - Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.
   - Therefore, the total number of puppies is:
     \[
     8 + 12 = 20
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of puppies with spots**:
   - Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots.
   - Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots.
   - Therefore, the total number of puppies with spots is:
     \[
     3 + 4 = 7
     \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots**:
   - The percentage of puppies with spots can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of puppies with spots}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   - First, calculate \( \frac{7}{20} \):
     \[
     \frac{7}{20} = 0.35
     \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.35 \times 100 = 35
     \]

5. **State the final answer**:
   - Therefore, the percentage of all the puppies that have spots is:
     \[
     \boxed{35\%}
     \]
