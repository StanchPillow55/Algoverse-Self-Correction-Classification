=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first define the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother based on the information provided.

1. **Dora's Age**: We know that Dora is 15 years old.
   \[
   \text{Dora's age} = 15
   \]

2. **Father's Age**: The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's age} + 8
   \]
   Substituting Dora's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 2 \times 15 + 8
   \]
   Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Father's age} = 30 + 8 = 38
   \]

3. **Mother's Age**: The problem also states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = \text{Father's age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting the father's age into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 38 - 4
   \]
   Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Mother's age} = 34
   \]

4. **Total Combined Age**: Now we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother. We can calculate this by adding their ages together:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Dora's age} + \text{Father's age} + \text{Mother's age}
   \]
   Substituting the ages we found:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 + 34
   \]
   Now, calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 15 + 38 = 53
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 53 + 34 = 87
   \]

Thus, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is:
\[
\boxed{87}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
- Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
- Dora is 15 years old.

Step 1: Find Dora's father's age.
Dora's father's age = 2 × Dora's age + 8
Dora's father's age = 2 × 15 + 8 = 38 years old

Step 2: Find Dora's mother's age.
Dora's mother's age = Dora's father's age - 4
Dora's mother's age = 38 - 4 = 34 years...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora's father and mother based on the information provided, and then calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Dora's age:**
   - Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Determine Dora's father's age:**
   - The problem states that Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Dora is 15 years old
* Father's age = 2 × Dora's age + 8
* Mother is 4 years younger than father

2. Let's calculate father's age:
* Father's age = 2 × 15 + 8
* Father's age = 30 + 8
* Father's age = 38 years old

3. Now let's calculate mother's age:
* Mother's age = Father's age - 4
* Mother's age = 38 - 4
* Mother's age = 34 years old

4. To find the total combined age:
* T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding the age of Dora's father. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, twice her age would be 2*15 = 30 years. Adding eight to this, we find that Dora's father is 30+8 = 38 years old.

Next, we find the age of Dora's mother. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Since Dora's father is 38 years old, Dora's mother would be 38-4 = 34 years old.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dora is 15 years old.
   * Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   * Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.

2. Calculate Dora's father's age:
   * Dora's age = 15
   * Dora's father's age = (2 × Dora's age) + 8
   * Dora's father's age = (2 × 15) + 8
   * Dora's father's age = 30 + 8
   * Dora's father's age = 38
