=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs Gabriel and Luri can each add to their portable media players, and then find the difference between those two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of songs Luri has:**
   - Gabriel has 20 songs.
   - Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
   \[
   \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many more songs each can add:**
   - The maximum capacity of each media player is 100 songs.
   - To find out how many more songs Gabriel can add:
   \[
   \text{Gabriel's capacity to add songs} = 100 - \text{Gabriel's songs} = 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ songs}
   \]
   - To find out how many more songs Luri can add:
   \[
   \text{Luri's capacity to add songs} = 100 - \text{Luri's songs} = 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ songs}
   \]

3. **Determine how many fewer songs Luri can add compared to Gabriel:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of songs Gabriel can add and the number of songs Luri can add:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Gabriel's capacity to add songs} - \text{Luri's capacity to add songs} = 80 - 40 = 40
   \]

Thus, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.

**Final Answer:**
Luri can add 40 fewer songs than Gabriel.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs Gabriel and Luri can each add to their portable media players, and then find the difference between those two amounts.

1. **Determine the number of songs Luri has:**
   - Gabriel has 20 songs.
   - Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel.
   \[
   \text{Luri's songs} = 3 \times \text{Gabriel's songs} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ songs}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gabriel's portable media player can store up to 100 songs.
- Gabriel currently has 20 songs on his player.
- Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel on his player.

Step 1: Calculate how many songs Luri has on his player.
Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
Luri's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs

Step 2: Calculate the remaining space on each player.
Gabriel's remaining space = 100 - 20 = 80 so...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more songs each person can add to their portable media player and then find the difference between these two amounts.

**Step 1: Determine the number of songs Luri has.**

We know that Gabriel has 20 songs on his player. Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel. Therefore, we can calculate the number of songs Luri has as follows:

\[
\text{Number of songs Luri has} = 3 \times \text{Number of songs Gabriel has} = 3 \ti...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Each player can store 100 songs (maximum capacity)
* Gabriel has 20 songs on his player
* Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel

2. Calculate how many songs Luri has:
* Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
* Luri's songs = 3 × 20 = 60 songs

3. Calculate how many more songs each person can add:
* For Gabriel:
  * Space remaining = Maximum capacity - Current songs
  *...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since we know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we multiply Gabriel's number of songs by 3.

20 songs * 3 = 60 songs

So, Luri has 60 songs on her player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each person can add to their player. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs they currently have from 100.

For Gabriel: 100 songs - 20 songs = 80 songs
For L...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Both Gabriel and Luri have portable media players that can store up to 100 songs each.
   * Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.
   * Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel on his player.

2. Calculate the number of songs Luri has on his player:
   * Luri's songs = 3 × Gabriel's songs
   * Luri's songs = 3 × 20
   * Luri's songs = 60

3. Calculate the number of...
