=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math. We know the following:

1. There are a total of 20 students in the class.
2. 5 students are good at math only.
3. 8 students are good at English only.
4. The rest of the students are good at both math and English.

Let's denote:
- \( M \): the number of students good at math.
- \( E \): the number of students good at English.
- \( B \): the number of students good at both subjects.

From the information given, we can summarize:
- Students good at math only: 5
- Students good at English only: 8
- Students good at both subjects: \( B \)

The total number of students can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Total students} = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at English only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
20 = 5 + 8 + B
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation to find \( B \):
\[
20 = 13 + B
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides gives:
\[
B = 20 - 13 = 7
\]

Now we know that there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Next, we can calculate the total number of students who are good at math. The students good at math include those who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects:
\[
M = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
M = 5 + 7 = 12
\]

Thus, the total number of students who are good at math is \( 12 \).

Finally, we state our final answer:
\[
\text{The number of students good at math is } 12.
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who are good at math.

Given information:
- There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Let's represent the students in a Venn diagram:

                   Math
                     5
                    ┌───┐

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are good at math in Miss Susan's class. We are given the following information:

- There are 20 students in total.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students are good at English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Let's denote:
- \( M \) as the set of students who are good at math.

- \( M \cap E \) as the set of students who are g...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* Total students = 20
* Students good at math only = 5
* Students good at English only = 8
* The rest are good at both math and English

2) To find students good at both subjects:
* Rest = Total - (Math only + English only)
* Rest = 20 - (5 + 8)
* Rest = 20 - 13
* Rest = 7 students are good at both

3) To find total students good at math:
* Students good at math = Students good at mat...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many students are good at both math and English. We know that there are 20 students in total, and 5 of them are good at math only, and 8 of them are good at English only. 

So, we subtract the number of students who are good at math only and the number of students who are good at English only from the total number of students:

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math.

Given:
- There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The remaining students are good at both math and English.

Step 1: Determine the number of students who are good at both math and English.
- Total students = 20
- Studen...
