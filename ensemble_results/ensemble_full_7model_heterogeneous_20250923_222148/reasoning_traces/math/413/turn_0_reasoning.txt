=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles both smell like wet dog and explode. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
   - 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
   - Among the candles that are more dangerous (i.e., the ones that can explode), 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles**:
   - Since 1% of the candles are expected to explode, we calculate the number of exploding candles as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000 = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Candles that Smell Like Wet Dog**:
   - Out of the candles that explode, 5% are said to smell like wet dog. We need to find 5% of the 500 exploding candles:
     \[
     \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog and explode} = 5\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is \( \boxed{25} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of candles that have both the "wet dog" smell and the "explosion" defect.

Given information:
- Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
- 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode.
- 5% of the more dangerous candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

Step 1: Find the number of candles that are not guaranteed not to explode.
Number of candles not guaranteed not to explode = 50,000 × (1 - 0.99...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This implies that 1% of the candles do explode.
   - Among the candles that explode, 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculate the Number of Exploding Candles:**
   - Marcy makes a total of 50,...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify the key information:
* Total candles = 50,000
* 1% of candles explode (since 99% are guaranteed not to explode)
* 5% of the dangerous (exploding) candles smell like wet dog

2) Calculate how many candles will explode:
* 1% of 50,000 = 0.01 × 50,000 = 500 exploding candles

3) Calculate how many of the exploding candles smell like wet dog:
* 5% of 500 = 0.05 × 500 = 25 candles

Therefore, 25 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many candles are more likely to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, this means that 1% of them are likely to explode. 

To find out how many candles this 1% represents, we multiply the total number of candles (50000) by 1% (or 0.01):

50000 * 0.01 = 500 candles

So, 500 candles are more likely to explode.

Next, we need to find out how many of these 500 candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Marcy makes homemade candles.
   * 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles may explode.
   * 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that may explode) also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.
   * Marcy makes a total of 50,000 candles.

2. Calculate the number of candles that may explode:
   * 1% of 50,000 ...
