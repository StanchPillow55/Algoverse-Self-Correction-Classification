=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about the oranges in the basket.

1. **Total Oranges**: We know there are a total of 25 oranges in the basket.

2. **Bad Oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.

3. **Unripe Oranges**: We are told that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of unripe oranges} = 20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

4. **Sour Oranges**: There are 2 sour oranges.

5. **Good Oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we first need to determine how many oranges are accounted for by the bad, unripe, and sour categories. We will add these together:
   - Bad oranges: 1
   - Unripe oranges: 5
   - Sour oranges: 2

   Now we sum these:
   \[
   \text{Total accounted oranges} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
   \]

6. **Calculating Good Oranges**: The number of good oranges can be found by subtracting the total accounted oranges from the total number of oranges:
   \[
   \text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total oranges} - \text{Total accounted oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

Thus, the number of good oranges in the basket is \( \boxed{17} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given about the oranges in the basket.

1. **Total Oranges**: We know there are a total of 25 oranges in the basket.

2. **Bad Oranges**: There is 1 bad orange.

3. **Unripe Oranges**: We are told that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate:

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The basket contains 25 oranges.
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.

Step 1: Calculate the number of unripe oranges.
20% of 25 oranges = 0.20 × 25 = 5 unripe oranges

Step 2: Calculate the number of good oranges.
Total oranges - Bad oranges - Unripe oranges - Sour oranges = Good oranges
25 - 1 - 5 - 2 = 17 good oranges

Therefore, the number of good orange...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many oranges in the basket are classified as "good." We have a total of 25 oranges, and we are given information about different categories of oranges: bad, unripe, sour, and good.

Let's break down the information:

1. **Total Oranges:** 25

2. **Bad Oranges:** 1

3. **Unripe Oranges:** 20% of the total oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, we calculate 20% of 25:
   \[
   \text{Unripe Oranges} = 0.20 \...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total oranges = 25
* Bad oranges = 1
* Unripe oranges = 20% of total
* Sour oranges = 2
* Good oranges = remaining oranges

2. Calculate unripe oranges:
* 20% of 25 = (20/100) × 25 = 5 unripe oranges

3. Now we can find good oranges by subtracting all non-good oranges:
* Non-good oranges = Bad + Unripe + Sour
* Non-good oranges = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8 oranges

4. Calculate good orang...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can calculate this by taking 20% of 25. 

20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5 oranges

So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

We know that there is 1 bad orange and 2 sour oranges. 

So, the total number of oranges that are not good is 1 (bad) + 5 (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges

The rest of the oranges are good. 

So, to find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of not good orange...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the number of good oranges.

Given:
- The basket contains a total of 25 oranges.
- 1 orange is bad.
- 20% of the oranges are unripe.
- 2 oranges are sour.
- The remaining oranges are good.

Step 1: Calculate the number of unripe oranges.
20% of 25 oranges = 0.20 × 25 = 5 orang...
