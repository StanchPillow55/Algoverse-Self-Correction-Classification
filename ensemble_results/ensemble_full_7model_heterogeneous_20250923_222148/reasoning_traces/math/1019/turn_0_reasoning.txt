=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Guests**: The hotel starts with 100 guests.

2. **Early Checkout**: 24 guests elected for an early checkout. 
   \[
   \text{Guests after early checkout} = 100 - 24 = 76
   \]

3. **Late Checkout**: 15 guests elected for a late checkout. 
   \[
   \text{Guests after late checkout} = 76 - 15 = 61
   \]

4. **Check-ins in the Afternoon**: The problem states that twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout, the number of guests checking in during the afternoon is:
   \[
   \text{Guests checking in} = 2 \times 15 = 30
   \]
   Now, we add these guests to the current number of guests:
   \[
   \text{Guests after afternoon check-in} = 61 + 30 = 91
   \]

5. **Check-ins After Dinner**: The problem states that 7 more people checked in after dinner. We add this number to the current total:
   \[
   \text{Final number of guests} = 91 + 7 = 98
   \]

Thus, the total number of guests in the hotel now is:
\[
\boxed{98}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of guests in the hotel throughout the day, considering the checkouts and check-ins.

1. **Initial Number of Guests:**
   - The hotel starts with 100 guests.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of guests:
* Starting with 100 guests

2. Early checkouts:
* 24 guests left early
* 100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining

3. Late checkouts:
* 15 guests stayed late
* These guests are still included in the 76 remaining

4. Afternoon check-ins:
* Twice as many as late checkouts
* Late checkouts = 15
* So afternoon check-ins = 15 Ã— 2 = 30 new guests
* 76 + 30 = 106 guests after afternoon check-ins

5. Afte...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The hotel started with 100 guests. 

In the morning, 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100: 

100 - 24 = 76 guests remained.

Then, 15 guests opted for a late checkout, so they are still in the hotel. 

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. So, 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. 

Adding these 30 people to the remaining guests, we get: 

76 + 30 = 106 guests.

In the evening, 7 more people checked in. Addin...
