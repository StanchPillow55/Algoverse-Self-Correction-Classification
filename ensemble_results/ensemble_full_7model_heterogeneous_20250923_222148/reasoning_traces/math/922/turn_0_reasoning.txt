=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the time frame**: Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old. We need to calculate how many years she has been collecting shells by the time she turns 10.

2. **Calculate the number of years**: 
   - From age 5 to age 10 is a span of \(10 - 5 = 5\) years.

3. **Convert years to months**: 
   - Since Martha collects one shell every month, we need to convert the number of years into months. 
   - There are 12 months in a year, so in 5 years, the total number of months is:
     \[
     5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of shells collected**: 
   - Since Martha collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she collects over 60 months is:
     \[
     60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
     \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   - By her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected a total of 60 shells.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of shells Martha will have collected by her 10th birthday.

Given information:
- Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
- Every month, she collects one shell.
- We need to find the number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

Step 1: Calculate the number of months between Martha's 5th birthday and her 10th birthday.
Number of months = 10 years × 12 months...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of shells Martha collects from the time she turns 5 years old until her 10th birthday.

1. **Determine the Time Span:**
   - Martha starts collecting shells when she turns 5 years old.
   - She continues collecting shells until her 10th birthday.
   - Therefore, the time span during which she collects shells is from age 5 to age 10.

2. **Calculate the Number of Years:**
   - From age 5 to age 10 is a period of...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Martha started collecting at age 5
* She collects 1 shell per month
* We need to find total shells by her 10th birthday

2. Let's calculate the time period:
* From age 5 to age 10 = 5 years
* Convert years to months:
* 5 years × 12 months = 60 months

3. Calculate total shells:
* Martha collects 1 shell per month
* Total shells = Number of months × Shells per month
* T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine the total number of months from Martha's 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. Therefore, the number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.
   * She collects one shell every month.
   * We need to find the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

2. Calculate the number of months between Martha's 5th and 10th birthdays:
   * From 5 years old to 10 years old, there are 5 years.
   * Each year has 12 months.
   *...
