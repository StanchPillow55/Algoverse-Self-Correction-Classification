=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set using variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.
- According to the problem, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set can be expressed as \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of tennis balls retrieved:

\[
\text{Total balls} = \text{Balls in first set} + \text{Balls in second set} + \text{Balls in third set}
\]

Substituting the expressions we defined:

\[
19 = (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2}
\]

Now, let's simplify the equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   19 = x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2}
   \]
   \[
   19 = 2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. To combine \( 2x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \), we can express \( 2x \) as \( \frac{4x}{2} \):
   \[
   19 = \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} + 4
   \]
   \[
   19 = \frac{4x + x}{2} + 4
   \]
   \[
   19 = \frac{5x}{2} + 4
   \]

3. Next, we isolate \( \frac{5x}{2} \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
   \[
   19 - 4 = \frac{5x}{2}
   \]
   \[
   15 = \frac{5x}{2}
   \]

4. To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   2 \cdot 15 = 5x
   \]
   \[
   30 = 5x
   \]

5. Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{30}{5}
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Balls in the second set: \( x = 6 \)
- Balls in the first set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Balls in the third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{First set} + \text{Second set} + \text{Third set} = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

The total matches the given information, confirming our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set and then determine the number of balls he retrieved in the first set.

Given information:
- In the first set, Rory had to retrieve four more balls than in the second set.
- In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.
- Rory retrieved a total of 19 tennis balls.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of tennis balls Ror...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set.

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. In the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is \( x + 4 \).
2. In the third set, Rory retri...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define variables:
   * Let's say the number of balls in the second set is x
   * Then the first set would be x + 4 (four more than second set)
   * The third set would be x/2 (half of second set)

2) We know the total number of balls is 19, so we can write an equation:
   * (x + 4) + x + (x/2) = 19

3) Let's solve the equation:
   * x + 4 + x + x/2 = 19
   * Combine like terms: 2.5x + 4 = 19
   * Subtract 4...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set as x. 

According to the problem, in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so that would be x + 4 balls. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so that would be x/2 balls. 

The total number of balls retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation:

x (second set) + x + 4 (first set...

Given:
- Rory retrieved tennis balls in three sets.
- In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set.
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set.
