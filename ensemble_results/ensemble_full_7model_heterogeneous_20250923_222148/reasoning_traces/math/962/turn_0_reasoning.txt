=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost of travel tickets based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the cost of supplies**: 
   Jen pays $400 for supplies.

2. **Calculate the cost of travel tickets**:
   The problem states that the tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies. To find the cost of the tickets, we first need to calculate what 50% of the supplies cost is.

   \[
   \text{50% of supplies} = 0.50 \times 400 = 200
   \]

3. **Add the 50% increase to the original cost of supplies**:
   Now, we add this amount to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the travel tickets.

   \[
   \text{Cost of travel tickets} = \text{Cost of supplies} + \text{50% of supplies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of travel tickets} = 400 + 200 = 600
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total cost of travel tickets is 

   \[
   \boxed{600}
   \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
* Supplies cost $400 total
* Travel tickets cost 50% more than supplies

Step 1: Calculate what 50% more means
* 50% = 50/100 = 0.5
* 50% more means the original amount plus 50% of the original amount
* Or in other words, 150% of the original amount

Step 2: Calculate the travel cost
* Travel cost = Supplies cost × 150%
* Travel cost = $400 × 1.50
* Travel cost = $600

Therefore, the travel ticket...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find the total cost of travel, we first need to find out how much more the travel tickets cost than the supplies. We know that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.

First, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies. We do this by multiplying the cost of the supplies by 0.50 (which is the decimal equivalent of 50%).

So, 50% of $400 is $400 * 0.50 = $200.

This means that the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies.
