=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Number of Shoes**: 
   Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

2. **Gains on Monday**: 
   On Monday, Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, we calculate the total number of shoes gained on Monday:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Monday} = 5 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 10 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Now, we add this to the initial number of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Monday} = 200 + 10 = 210 \text{ shoes}
   \]

3. **Gains on Wednesday**: 
   On Wednesday, Frank gains 15 new pairs of shoes. Again, we calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Wednesday} = 15 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 30 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding this to the total from Monday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Wednesday} = 210 + 30 = 240 \text{ shoes}
   \]

4. **Gains on Friday**: 
   On Friday, Frank gains 30 pairs of shoes. We calculate the total number of shoes gained:
   \[
   \text{Shoes gained on Friday} = 30 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ shoes/pair} = 60 \text{ shoes}
   \]
   Adding this to the total from Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Friday} = 240 + 60 = 300 \text{ shoes}
   \]

5. **Loss on Saturday**: 
   On Saturday, Frank gets rid of 180 shoes. We subtract this from the total number of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes after Saturday} = 300 - 180 = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

6. **Final Count on Sunday**: 
   After all the gains and losses, the total number of shoes Frank has on Sunday is:
   \[
   \text{Total shoes on Sunday} = 120 \text{ shoes}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of shoes Fireman Frank has throughout the week, taking into account the pairs of shoes he gains and the shoes he gets rid of.

### Initial Condition:
- Fireman Frank starts with 200 shoes.

### Monday:
- He gains 5 pairs of shoes. Since each pair consists of 2 shoes, he gains \(5 \times 2 = 10\) shoes.
- New total on Monday: \(200 + 10 = 210\) shoes.

### Wednesday:
- He gains 15 pairs of shoes. Again, each pai...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's start with Fireman Frank's initial shoes:
* Initial amount = 200 shoes

2. Let's add the shoes he gains:
* Monday: 5 pairs of shoes
  * 5 pairs = 5 × 2 = 10 shoes
* Wednesday: 15 pairs of shoes
  * 15 pairs = 15 × 2 = 30 shoes
* Friday: 30 pairs of shoes
  * 30 pairs = 30 × 2 = 60 shoes

3. Let's add all the new shoes to the initial amount:
* Total = Initial + Monday + Wednesday + Friday
* Total = 20...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to understand that a pair of shoes is made up of 2 shoes. 

So, if Fireman Frank gets 5 pairs of shoes on Monday, that's 5 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 10 shoes.

On Wednesday, he gains 15 new pairs, which is 15 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 30 shoes.

On Friday, he gains 30 pairs, which is 30 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 60 shoes.

So, from Monday to Friday, Fireman Frank has gained 10 shoes + 30 shoes + 60 shoes = 100 shoes.

If we add these 100 shoes to the 200 shoes he al...
