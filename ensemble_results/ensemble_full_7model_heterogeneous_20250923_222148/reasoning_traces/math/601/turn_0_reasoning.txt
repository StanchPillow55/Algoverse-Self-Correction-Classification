=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many games Steve has after 3 years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Games**: 
   - Steve receives 5 games for his birthday.
   - He also gets a console, but we are only counting games.
   - **Total games after birthday**: 5 games.

2. **Games Purchased Over 3 Years**:
   - **Year 1**: 
     - Steve buys 1 game per month for 12 months.
     - Total games bought in Year 1 = 1 game/month × 12 months = 12 games.
     - He also receives 5 games for Christmas.
     - Total games after Year 1 = Initial games + Games bought + Christmas games = 5 + 12 + 5 = 22 games.

   - **Year 2**: 
     - Steve buys 2 games per month for 12 months.
     - Total games bought in Year 2 = 2 games/month × 12 months = 24 games.
     - He again receives 5 games for Christmas.
     - Total games after Year 2 = Games after Year 1 + Games bought + Christmas games = 22 + 24 + 5 = 51 games.

   - **Year 3**: 
     - Steve buys 4 games per month for 12 months.
     - Total games bought in Year 3 = 4 games/month × 12 months = 48 games.
     - He receives 5 games for Christmas once more.
     - Total games after Year 3 = Games after Year 2 + Games bought + Christmas games = 51 + 48 + 5 = 104 games.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - After calculating all the games Steve has after each year, we find that after 3 years, he has a total of **104 games**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Steve has 104 games after 3 years.**
