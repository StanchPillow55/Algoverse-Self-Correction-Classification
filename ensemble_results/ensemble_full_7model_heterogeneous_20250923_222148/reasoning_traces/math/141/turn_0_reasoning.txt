=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to define variables for the different types of bees in the hive. Let's denote:

- \( q \) = number of queen bees
- \( b \) = number of baby bees
- \( w \) = number of worker bees

From the problem statement, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of bees in the hive is 700:
   \[
   q + b + w = 700
   \]

2. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
   \[
   w = 2b
   \]

3. There are twice as many baby bees as queens:
   \[
   b = 2q
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( w \) and \( b \) in terms of \( q \) into the total bee equation.

First, substitute \( b = 2q \) into the equation for \( w \):
\[
w = 2b = 2(2q) = 4q
\]

Now we have expressions for \( b \) and \( w \) in terms of \( q \):
- \( b = 2q \)
- \( w = 4q \)

Next, substitute these into the total number of bees equation:
\[
q + b + w = 700
\]
Substituting \( b \) and \( w \):
\[
q + 2q + 4q = 700
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
7q = 700
\]

Now, solve for \( q \):
\[
q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
\]

Now that we have the number of queen bees, we can find the number of baby bees:
\[
b = 2q = 2(100) = 200
\]

Next, we can find the number of worker bees:
\[
w = 4q = 4(100) = 400
\]

Finally, we can summarize our findings:
- Number of queen bees \( q = 100 \)
- Number of baby bees \( b = 200 \)
- Number of worker bees \( w = 400 \)

Thus, the number of worker bees in the hive is:
\[
\boxed{400}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 700 bees in the hive.
- There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees.
- There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of queen bees
- Then 2x = the number of baby bees
- And 4x = the number of worker bees

We know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can set up an equation:
x + 2x + 4x = 700

Simplifying the equatio...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of worker bees in the hive given the relationships between the different types of bees.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( q \) represent the number of queen bees.
- Let \( b \) represent the number of baby bees.
- Let \( w \) represent the number of worker bees.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees: \( b = 2q \).
2. There are twice as m...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we know:
* Total bees = 700
* Worker bees = 2 × Baby bees
* Baby bees = 2 × Queens

2) Let's say the number of queens is x
* Then baby bees = 2x
* And worker bees = 2(2x) = 4x

3) We know all bees add up to 700:
* Queens + Baby bees + Worker bees = 700
* x + 2x + 4x = 700
* 7x = 700

4) Solve for x:
* x = 700 ÷ 7
* x = 100
* So there are 100 queens

5) Now we can find worker bees:
* Wor...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. 

From the problem, we know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so we can write B = 2Q. 

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write W = 2B. 

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write Q + B + W = 700. 

We can substitute B = 2Q and W = 2B into the equation Q + B + W = 700 to get Q + 2Q + 2(2...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the number of worker bees in the hive.

Given:
- Total number of bees in the hive = 700
- Number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees
- Number of baby bees is twice the number of queen bees

Step 1: Let's express the number of worker bees and baby bees in terms of the number of queen bees.
Let the number of queen bees be x.
Number of baby bees = 2x (twice the number of queen bee...
