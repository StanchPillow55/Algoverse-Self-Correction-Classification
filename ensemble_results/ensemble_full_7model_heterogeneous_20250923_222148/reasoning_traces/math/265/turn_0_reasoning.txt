=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. Then we will compare this total cost to her budget of $400,000.

**Step 1: Calculate the brokerage fee.**

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the transfer fee.**

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the house.**

Now we can find the total cost by adding the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee together.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 59,500 = 409,500
\]

**Step 4: Compare the total cost to Mrs. Cruz's budget.**

Mrs. Cruz's budget is $400,000. We need to find out how much more the total cost is than her budget.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, so we calculate it as follows:

350,000 * 5/100 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, so we calculate it as follows:

350,000 * 12/100 = $42,000

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to find the total price of the house:

350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = $409,500

Finally, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from th...
