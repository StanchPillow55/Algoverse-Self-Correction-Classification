=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts he eats is:
     \[
     \text{Total yogurts} = 2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy.**
   - The yogurts are sold in packs of 4.
   - To find out how many packs Terry needs, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/pack}} = 15 \text{ packs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the yogurts.**
   - Each pack costs $5.00.
   - To find the total cost for 15 packs, we multiply the number of packs by the cost per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 15 \text{ packs} \times 5.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 75.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{75.00}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
- Yogurts are on sale at 4 for $5.00.
- We need to find how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yogurts Terry consumes in 30 days and then calculate the total cost based on the sale price.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Yogurts Consumed

Terry eats 2 yogurts per day. Therefore, over 30 days, the total number of yogurts he consumes is:

\[
2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost of Yogurts

The sale price is 4 yogurts for $5.00. We need...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Terry eats 2 yogurts per day
* Yogurts cost 4 for $5.00
* Need to calculate cost for 30 days

2. Calculate how many yogurts Terry needs for 30 days:
* Daily yogurts = 2
* Number of days = 30
* Total yogurts needed = 2 × 30 = 60 yogurts

3. Calculate the cost per yogurt:
* 4 yogurts cost $5.00
* Cost per yogurt = $5.00 ÷ 4 = $1.25 per yogurt

4. Calculate total cost for...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply 2 by 30. 

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we need to find out how much 60 yogurts cost. Since 4 yogurts cost $5.00, we first find the cost of one yogurt by dividing $5.00 by 4.

$5.00 / 4 yogurts = $1.25 per yogurt

Then, we multiply the cost of one yogurt by the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.

$1.25 per yogurt * 60 yogurts = $75.00

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Terry eats 2 yogurts per day.
   * The yogurts are on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.
   * We need to calculate the cost of yogurt over 30 days.

2. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days:
   * Yogurts per day = 2
   * Number of days = 30
   * Total yogurts eaten = Yogurts per day × Number of days
   * Total yogurts eaten = 2 × 30 = 60 yogurts

3. Calculate...
