Final Answer: To determine how many calories John consumed from drinking 2 glasses of milk, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk John drank**: 
   Each glass of milk contains 8 ounces. Since John drinks 2 glasses, we can calculate the total ounces of milk he consumed:

   \[
   \text{Total ounces of milk} = \text{Number of glasses} \times \text{Ounces per glass}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total ounces of milk} = 2 \text{ glasses} \times 8 \text{ ounces/glass} = 16 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total calories in the milk**:
   We know that there are 3 calories per ounce of milk. To find the total calories consumed, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:

   \[
   \text{Total calories} = \text{Total ounces of milk} \times \text{Calories per ounce}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of calories John consumed from drinking 2 glasses of milk is:

   \[
   \boxed{48} \text{ calories}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk.
- John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
- Milk has 3 calories per ounce.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of milk John consumed.
Total milk consumed = 2 glasses × 8 ounces per glass = 16 ounces

Step 2: Calculate the total number of calories in the milk John consumed.
Total calories = Total milk consumed × Calories per ounce
Total calories = 16 ounces × 3 calor...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories John consumed by drinking 2 glasses of milk. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total ounces of milk John drank.
John drinks 2 glasses of milk, and each glass contains 8 ounces of milk. To find the total ounces of milk he drank, we multiply the number of glasses by the number of ounces per glass:

\[
2 \text{ glasses} \times 8 \text{ ounces per glass} = 16 \text{ ounces}
\]...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Each glass contains 8 ounces of milk
* John drinks 2 glasses
* Milk has 3 calories per ounce

2. Calculate total ounces of milk John drank:
* Ounces per glass × Number of glasses
* 8 ounces × 2 glasses = 16 total ounces

3. Calculate total calories:
* Total ounces × Calories per ounce
* 16 ounces × 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

Therefore, John consumed 48 calor...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many ounces of milk John drank. Since one glass of milk is 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we multiply 8 ounces by 2. 

8 ounces/glass * 2 glasses = 16 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply 16 ounces by 3 calories.

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk. 

Final Answer: John consumed 48...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * One glass of milk contains 8 ounces.
   * John drinks 2 glasses of milk.
   * Each ounce of milk has 3 calories.

2. Calculate the total number of ounces John consumed:
   * 1 glass = 8 ounces
   * John drank 2 glasses
   * Total ounces consumed = 8 ounces × 2
   * Total ounces consumed = 16 ounces

3. Calculate the total number of calories John consumed:
   * 1 ounce ...
