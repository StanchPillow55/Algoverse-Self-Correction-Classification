=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies with his budget of $42, we first need to calculate the total cost for one trip to the movies, which includes the ticket and popcorn.

1. **Calculate the cost of one trip to the movies:**
   - Cost of a movie ticket = $7
   - Cost of popcorn = $7
   - Total cost for one trip = Cost of ticket + Cost of popcorn
   \[
   \text{Total cost for one trip} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how many trips Peter can afford:**
   - Peter has a total of $42 to spend.
   - To find out how many trips he can make, we divide his total budget by the cost of one trip.
   \[
   \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total budget}}{\text{Cost per trip}} = \frac{42}{14}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3
   \]

Thus, Peter can go to the movies **3 times** with his budget of $42.

4. **Final answer:**
Peter can go to the movies **3 times**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how many times Peter can go to the movies with the $42 he has for the week.

Given information:
- The cost of a movie ticket is $7.
- The cost of popcorn is $7.
- Peter has $42 for the week.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of one trip to the movies.
Cost of a movie ticket + Cost of popcorn = Total cost of one trip to the movies
$7 + $7 = $14

Step 2: Calculate the number of times Peter can go to the movies....

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Peter can go to the movies given his budget and the cost of each movie outing.

**Step 1: Determine the total cost per movie outing.**

Peter spends money on two things each time he goes to the movies:
- A movie ticket for $7
- Popcorn for $7

The total cost for one movie outing is the sum of these two expenses:
\[
\text{Total cost per outing} = \text{Cost of ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorn} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ d...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what Peter spends each time he goes to the movies:
   * Movie ticket = $7
   * Popcorn = $7
   * Total cost per visit = $7 + $7 = $14

2. Now we know:
   * Peter has $42 total
   * Each visit costs $14

3. To find how many times he can go, divide total money by cost per visit:
   * $42 รท $14 = 3

4. Let's verify this makes sense:
   * Cost for 3 visits = $14 ร 3 = $42
   * This uses all his ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The cost for Peter to go to the movies once is the cost of the ticket plus the cost of the popcorn. This is $7 + $7 = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of going to the movies once.

So, $42 รท $14 = 3.

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A movie ticket costs $7.
   * Popcorn costs $7.
   * Peter has a total of $42 for the week.

2. Calculate the total cost for one movie trip:
   * Cost of one movie trip = Ticket price + Popcorn price
   * Cost of one movie trip = $7 + $7
   * Cost of one movie trip = $14

3. Determine the number of movie trips Peter can afford:
   * Number of movie trips = Total money ...
