Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many slices of pizza were ordered in total, then calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and his friends, and finally find out how many slices are left.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas ordered.
Bryce and his four friends ordered their own pizzas, which means there are a total of 5 pizzas.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slices.
Each pizza has 12 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices from all pizzas is:
\[
\text{Total slices} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Slices per pizza} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many slices were eaten by Bryce and two friends.
Bryce and two of his friends ate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of their pizzas. Since there are 3 people in this group, we need to calculate how many slices they ate in total.

Each person has 1 pizza, so the total number of pizzas for Bryce and his two friends is:
\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by Bryce and friends} = 3 \text{ pizzas}
\]
Now, we calculate how many slices they ate:
\[
\text{Slices eaten by Bryce and friends} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Total slices for 3 pizzas} = \frac{2}{3} \times (3 \times 12) = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 = 24 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many slices were eaten by the two remaining friends.
The two remaining friends ate \( \frac{3}{4} \) of their pizzas. Each of them also has 1 pizza, so they have a total of:
\[
\text{Pizzas eaten by the two friends} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
\]
Now, we calculate how many slices they ate:
\[
\text{Slices eaten by the two friends} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total slices for 2 pizzas} = \frac{3}{4} \times (2 \times 12) = \frac{3}{4} \times 24 = 18 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of slices eaten.
Now we add the slices eaten by both groups:
\[
\text{Total slices eaten} = \text{Slices eaten by Bryce and friends} + \text{Slices eaten by the two friends} = 24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number of slices left.
Finally, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices ordered:
\[
\text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Total slices eaten} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ slices}
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of slices of pizza left is \( \boxed{18} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bryce and 4 of his friends each ordered their own pizzas.
- Each pizza had 12 slices.
- Bryce and 2 of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
- The 2 remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizza slices ordered.
Total number of pizzas = 5 (Bryce and 4 friends)
Total number of pizza slices = 5 pizzas × 12 slices per pizza = 60 slices

Step 2: Calcula...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza were left after Bryce and his friends ate their portions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Pizzas and Slices

Bryce and his four friends each ordered their own pizza. This means there are 5 pizzas in total. Each pizza has 12 slices.

Total number of slices = Number of pizzas × Slices per pizza  
\[ 
5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* 5 people total ordered pizzas
* Each pizza has 12 slices
* 3 people (Bryce and 2 friends) ate 2/3 of their pizzas
* 2 people ate 3/4 of their pizzas

2. Let's find how many slices were left from Bryce and his 2 friends' pizzas:
* Each pizza started with 12 slices
* They ate 2/3, so 1/3 was left
* For one pizza: 12 × (1/3) = 4 slices left
* For 3 pizzas: 4 × 3 = 12 slic...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that each pizza has 12 slices. 

Bryce and two of his friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas. That means they ate 2/3 * 12 slices = 8 slices each. Since there are 3 of them, they ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices.

The two remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas. That means they ate 3/4 * 12 slices = 9 slices each. Since there are 2 of them, they ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices.

So in total, Bryce and his friends ate...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 5 people in total (Bryce and his 4 friends).
   * Each pizza has 12 slices.
   * Bryce and 2 friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.
   * The other 2 friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas.

2. Calculate the number of slices eaten by Bryce and his 2 friends:
   * 2/3 of a pizza = (2/3) × 12 slices = 8 slices
   * 3 people ate 2/3 of their pizzas, so: 3 × 8 slices = 24 slic...
