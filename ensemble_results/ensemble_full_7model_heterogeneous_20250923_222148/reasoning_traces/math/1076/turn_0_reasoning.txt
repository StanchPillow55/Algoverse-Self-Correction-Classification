Final Answer: To find out how much money Terry makes in total from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we will calculate the total revenue from each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the revenue from milkshakes:**
   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each.
   - The total revenue from milkshakes can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total from milkshakes} = \text{Number of milkshakes} \times \text{Price per milkshake}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from burger platters:**
   - Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.
   - The total revenue from burger platters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total from burger platters} = \text{Number of burger platters} \times \text{Price per burger platter}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total from burger platters} = 9 \times 11 = 99.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from sodas:**
   - Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.
   - The total revenue from sodas can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total from sodas} = \text{Number of sodas} \times \text{Price per soda}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total from sodas} = 20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
     \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Now we will sum the total revenues from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total from milkshakes} + \text{Total from burger platters} + \text{Total from sodas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 162.00
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Terry makes is **$162.00**. 

Final answer: **$162.00**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate money from milkshakes:
* Number of milkshakes = 6
* Price per milkshake = $5.50
* Total for milkshakes = 6 × $5.50 = $33.00

2. Next, let's calculate money from burger platters:
* Number of platters = 9
* Price per platter = $11.00
* Total for platters = 9 × $11.00 = $99.00

3. Finally, let's calculate money from sodas:
* Number of sodas = 20
* Price per soda = $1.50
* Total for sodas = 20 ...
