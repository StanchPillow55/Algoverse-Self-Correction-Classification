=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy for the birthday party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of cupcakes needed**: Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party.

2. **Calculate the number of cupcakes Paul already has**: 
   - He has 8 chocolate cupcakes.
   - He has 40 toffee cupcakes.
   - To find the total number of cupcakes he currently has, we add these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total cupcakes Paul has} = \text{Chocolate cupcakes} + \text{Toffee cupcakes} = 8 + 40 = 48
     \]

3. **Determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs**: 
   - To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number of cupcakes needed:
     \[
     \text{Cupcakes needed} = \text{Total cupcakes needed} - \text{Total cupcakes Paul has} = 63 - 48
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     63 - 48 = 15
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes to have enough for the birthday party.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Paul already has a total of 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

To find out how many cupcakes he already has, we add these two amounts together:

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already has) = 15 cupcakes
