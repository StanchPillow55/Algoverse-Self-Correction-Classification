=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students are on campus at the end of May, starting with 10 students at the beginning of the year, and how many additional students have joined by that time.

1. **Understanding the Doubling Process**:
   - The number of students doubles at the end of every month.
   - We start with 10 students at the beginning of January.

2. **Calculating the Number of Students at the End of Each Month**:
   - **End of January**: 
     \[
     10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of February**: 
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of March**: 
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of April**: 
     \[
     80 \times 2 = 160 \text{ students}
     \]
   - **End of May**: 
     \[
     160 \times 2 = 320 \text{ students}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Additional Students**:
   - At the beginning of the year, there were 10 students.
   - By the end of May, there are 320 students.
   - To find the number of additional students who joined, we subtract the initial number of students from the total number of students at the end of May:
   \[
   320 - 10 = 310 \text{ additional students}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is \( \boxed{310} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of students on campus at the end of each month and then find the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the initial number of students at the beginning of the year.

Given information:
- The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month.
- There are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students on campus at t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to understand how the number of students changes each month and calculate the total number of students by the end of May. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year, and the number of students doubles at the end of each month.

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month:

1. **End of January:**
   - Start of January: 10 students
   - End of January: \(10 \times 2 = 20\) students

2. **End of February:**
   -...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's track the number of students at each stage:
   * January start: 10 students
   * End of January: 10 × 2 = 20 students
   * End of February: 20 × 2 = 40 students
   * End of March: 40 × 2 = 80 students
   * End of April: 80 × 2 = 160 students
   * End of May: 160 × 2 = 320 students

2) The question asks for additional students above the initial number
   * Total students at end of May = 320
   * Initial stud...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The number of students on campus doubles every month. This means that the number of students at the end of each month is 2 times the number of students at the beginning of that month.

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May:

- At the end of January, there will be 2 * 10 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, there will be 2 * 20 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, there will be 2 * 40 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. We start with 10 students at the beginning of the year.

2. The number of students doubles at the end of every month. This means:
   - At the end of January, the number of students will be 10 × 2 = 20
   - At the end of February, the number of students will be 20 × 2 = 40
   - At the end of March, the number of students will be 40 × 2 = 80
   - At the end of April, the number of students will be 80 × 2 = 160
