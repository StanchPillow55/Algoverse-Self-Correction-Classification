=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference between those distances.

### Step 1: Calculate Cho's Distance
Cho hiked at a speed of 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours. We can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For Cho:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{h}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \times 8 = 112 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Chloe's Distance
Chloe hiked at a speed of 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours. We will use the same distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{h}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \, \text{km}
\]

### Step 3: Find the Difference in Distances
Now, we need to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked compared to Chloe. We do this by subtracting Chloe's distance from Cho's distance:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}}
\]

Substituting the distances we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 45 = 67 \, \text{km}
\]

### Final Answer
Cho hiked **67 kilometers farther** than Chloe.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance hiked by Cho and Chloe, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour for 5 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance hiked by Cho.
Cho's distance = Cho's speed × Cho's time
Cho's distance = 14 kilometers per hour × 8 hours
Cho's distance = 112 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total dis...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked and then find the difference between these distances.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Cho hiked.**

Cho's hiking speed is 14 kilometers per hour, and she hiked for 8 hours. To find the total distance Cho hiked, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Distance Cho hiked} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hour...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how far Cho hiked:
* Cho's speed = 14 kilometers per hour
* Cho's time = 8 hours
* Cho's distance = speed × time
* Cho's distance = 14 × 8 = 112 kilometers

2. Next, let's find how far Chloe hiked:
* Chloe's speed = 9 kilometers per hour
* Chloe's time = 5 hours
* Chloe's distance = speed × time
* Chloe's distance = 9 × 5 = 45 kilometers

3. To find how much farther Cho hiked:
* Difference = Cho...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person hiked. 

First, we calculate the total distance Cho hiked. We know that distance is equal to speed times time. So, we multiply Cho's speed (14 kilometers per hour) by the time he hiked (8 hours). 

14 kilometers/hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers

Next, we calculate the total distance Chloe hiked. Again, we multiply her speed (9 kilometers per hour) by the time she hiked (5 hours).

9 kilometers/hour ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many more kilometers Cho hiked compared to Chloe.

Given:
- Cho hiked 14 kilometers per hour for 8 hours.
- Chloe hiked 9 kilometers per hour and stopped after 5 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Cho hiked.
Cho's distance = Speed × Time
Cho's distance = 14 km/h × 8 h = 112 km

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Chloe hiked.
Chloe's distance = Speed × Time
Chloe's distance...
