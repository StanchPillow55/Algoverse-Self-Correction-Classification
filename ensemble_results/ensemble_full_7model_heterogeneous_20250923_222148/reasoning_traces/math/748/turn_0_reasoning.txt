Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of marbles Sean has**: 
   According to the problem, Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine how many marbles Cal has**:
   The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
   \]
   Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
   \]
   To find Cal's marbles, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112
   \]

3. **Determine how many marbles Carl has**:
   The problem states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles}
   \]
   Substituting the number of marbles Sean has:
   \[
   \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined**:
   Now we need to find the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have together:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined is:
   \[
   \boxed{336}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.
- Sean has 56 marbles.

Step 1: Find how many marbles Cal has.
Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, we can use the following equation:
Sean's marbles = 1/2 × Cal's marbles
56 = 1/2 × Cal's marbles
Cal's marbles = 56 × 2 = 112 marbles

Step 2: Find how many marbles Carl has.
Since Carl has four time...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Carl and Cal have, given the relationships between the number of marbles each person has.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Sean has 56 marbles.
2. Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
3. Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

We need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined.

**Step 1: Determine how many marbles Carl has.**

Since Carl has four times as many mar...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Carl has 4 times as many marbles as Sean
- Sean has half as many marbles as Cal
- Sean has 56 marbles

Step 1: Find Cal's marbles
* If Sean has half as many marbles as Cal
* And Sean has 56 marbles
* Then Cal has 2 × 56 = 112 marbles

Step 2: Find Carl's marbles
* Carl has 4 times as many marbles as Sean
* Sean has 56 marbles
* So Carl has 4 × 56 = 224 marbles

Step 3: Find combined marbles of C...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have individually.

According to the problem, Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying 56 by 4.

56 * 4 = 224

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

The problem also states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This means that Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. We can calculate the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying 56 by 2....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sean has 56 marbles.
   * Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.
   * Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.

2. Find the number of marbles Cal has:
   * Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, which means Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean.
   * Number of marbles Cal has = 56 × 2
   * Number of marbles Cal has = 112

3. Find the number of marbles Carl has:...
