=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. The second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the amount the second person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 80
   \]

2. The third person took twice what the second person took. Thus, the amount the third person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   2(x + 80)
   \]

Now, we can express the total amount that all three people took as the sum of their individual shares:
\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Next, let's simplify the left-hand side of the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 240
   \]

2. Now we set the equation equal to the total amount:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

4. Next, we divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = 420
   \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

### Verification:
To ensure our solution is correct, let's calculate the shares of the second and third persons based on \( x = 420 \):

- The second person's share:
  \[
  x + 80 = 420 + 80 = 500
  \]

- The third person's share:
  \[
  2(x + 80) = 2(500) = 1000
  \]

Now, let's check the total:
\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]

Since the total matches the original amount, our calculations are confirmed. The share of the first person is indeed \( \boxed{420} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. The second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the amount the second person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 80
   \]

2. The third person took twice what the second person took. Thus, the amount the third person took can be expressed as:
   \[
   2(x + 80)
   \]

Now, we can express the total amount that all three people took as the sum of their in...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the share of the first person.

Given information:
- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice what the second person took.

Let's define the variables:
- Let the share of the first person be x.
- The share of the second person will be x + $80.
- The share of the third person will be 2(x + $80).

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the to...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person received from the total amount of $1920, given the conditions described.

Let's define the amount of money the first person received as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the amount the second person received is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took. Therefore, the amount the third person received is \( 2(...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Total amount = $1920
- Second person took $80 more than first person
- Third person took twice what second person took

Let's solve:
1) Let's say first person's share = x
   * Then second person's share = x + 80
   * And third person's share = 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160

2) Since total amount is $1920, we can write:
   * x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920

3) Simplify left side:
   * x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the amount of money that the first person took as x. 

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first one, so we can denote the amount of money that the second person took as x + $80.

The third person took twice what the second took, so we can denote the amount of money that the third person took as 2*(x + $80).

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + $80) + 2*(x + $80) = $1920

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the share of the first person.

Given:
- The total amount is $1920.
- The second person took $80 more than the first person.
- The third person took twice the amount of the second person.

Step 1: Let's express the shares of each person in terms of the first person's share.
First person's share = x
Second person's share = x + 80
Third person's share = 2(x + 80)

Step 2: The sum of all thre...
