=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week based on the production in the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

   \[
   \text{First week production} = 8,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

2. **Second Week Production**:
   In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, we calculate half of the first week's production:

   \[
   \text{Second week production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. We calculate three times the first week's production:

   \[
   \text{Third week production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   Now, we can find the total production for the first three weeks by adding the production from each week:

   \[
   \text{Total production for three weeks} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   8,000 + 4,000 = 12,000
   \]
   \[
   12,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**:
   Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. To find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:

   \[
   \text{Fourth week production} = 50,000 - 36,000
   \]

   Performing this calculation gives:

   \[
   50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Boris produces in the fourth week is:

\[
\boxed{14,000}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week, given his total monthly production and the production amounts for the first three weeks.

1. **Determine the total monthly production:**
   Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

2. **Calculate the production for each week:**
   - **First week:** Boris produces 8,000 bars.
   - **Second week:** Boris produces half as much as the first week. Therefore, the ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the known information:
* Total monthly production = 50,000 bars
* Week 1 production = 8,000 bars
* Week 2 production = half of Week 1 = 8,000 รท 2 = 4,000 bars
* Week 3 production = three times Week 1 = 8,000 ร 3 = 24,000 bars

2. To find Week 4 production:
* Total monthly production = Week 1 + Week 2 + Week 3 + Week 4
* 50,000 = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 + Week 4

3. Let's solve for Week 4:
* 5...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

In the first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate.

In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week. So, we calculate 8,000/2 = 4,000 bars of chocolate.

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. So, we calculate 8,000*3 = 24,000 bars of chocolate.

Now, we need to find out how much Boris produces in ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.
   * In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.
   * In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week.
   * In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week.
   * We need to find out how much he produces in the fourth week.

2. Calculate the production for the second ...
