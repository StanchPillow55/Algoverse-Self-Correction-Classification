=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched.**
   - Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.

2. **Determine the amount of fertiliser each truck is carrying.**
   - Each truck is carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.

3. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser dispatched.**
   - Total fertiliser = Number of trucks × Amount of fertiliser per truck
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.**
   - A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.
   - Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 20\)
   \[
   \text{Trucks with mechanical failures} = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.**
   - Successful deliveries = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
   \[
   \text{Successful deliveries} = 20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.**
   - Total fertiliser delivered = Number of successful trucks × Amount of fertiliser per truck
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Finally, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is:

\[
\boxed{300 \text{ tons}}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of fertiliser carried by all the trucks.
2. Determine the number of trucks that had mechanical failures.
3. Calculate the amount of fertiliser that was not delivered due to the mechanical failures.
4. Subtract the amount of fertiliser not delivered from the total amount of fertiliser to find the final amount that reached the farmers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amoun...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trucks successfully delivered their loads and calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered.

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched:**
   Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

2. **Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:**
   We are told that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. To find this, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of trucks with mechanical failures} = \fr...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total number of trucks = 20
* Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer
* 1/4 (a quarter) of the trucks had mechanical failures

2. Calculate how many trucks had mechanical failures:
* Number of failed trucks = 1/4 × 20 trucks
* Number of failed trucks = 5 trucks

3. Calculate how many trucks successfully delivered:
* Number of successful trucks = Total trucks - Failed ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks for delivery. However, a quarter of these trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilisers. 

First, we need to find out how many trucks broke down. A quarter of 20 trucks is 20/4 = 5 trucks. 

This means that 5 trucks did not make it to the farmers. 

So, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilisers is the total number of trucks minus the number of trucks that broke down. Th...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the final answer.

Given:
- Mr Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks for fertiliser delivery.
- Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.
- A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilisers.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of fertiliser initia...
