=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Dora needs to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.**
   - Cost of the skipping rope: $6
   - Cost of the board game: $11
   - Cost of the playground ball: $2

   Now, we add these costs together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 11 + 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 19
   \]

2. **Calculate how much money Dora currently has.**
   - Money saved from allowance: $2
   - Money given by her mother: $16

   Now, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 2 + 16
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 18
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Dora needs.**
   We need to find the difference between the total cost of the items and the total money Dora has:
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 19 - 18
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional money needed} = 1
   \]

Thus, Dora needs **$1 more** to buy the skipping rope, board game, and playground ball.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much money Dora has in total. She has $2 from her allowance and her mother gave her $16. So, we add these two amounts together:

$2 (from allowance) + $16 (from mother) = $18

So, Dora has $18 in total.

Next, let's find out how much the skipping rope, the board game, and the playground ball cost in total. The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. So, we add these three amounts together:

$6 (for skip...
