=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, given that Madeline pays 60% of the total grocery cost.

1. **Calculate the total cost of groceries per month:**
   The total cost of groceries for Madeline and Keenan is given as $400 per month.

2. **Determine how much Madeline pays:**
   Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we can calculate her contribution as follows:
   \[
   \text{Madeline's contribution} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much Keenan pays:**
   Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. We can calculate Keenan's contribution as follows:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's contribution} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Keenan spends per week:**
   The month is specified as a four-week month. To find out how much Keenan spends per week, we divide his total contribution for the month by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, Keenan spends **$40 per week** on groceries.

In summary, Keenan spends $40 each week on groceries, given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost and they spend $400 per month.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total monthly grocery cost = $400
* Madeline pays 60% of the cost
* We need to find Keenan's weekly cost
* There are 4 weeks in the month

2. Calculate Madeline's portion:
* Madeline pays 60%
* 60% of $400 = $400 × 0.60 = $240 per month

3. Calculate Keenan's portion:
* If Madeline pays 60%, Keenan pays 40%
* 40% of $400 = $400 × 0.40 = $160 per month

4. Calculate Kee...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since she pays 60% of the total cost, we multiply the total cost by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form). 

0.60 * $400 = $240

This means that Madeline pays $240 per month. 

Since the total cost of the groceries is $400, we subtract Madeline's contribution to find out how much Keenan pays. 

$400 - $240 = $160

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. 

To find out how much Keenan pays per week, we divide his monthly payment...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Madeline and Keenan spend a total of $400 per month on groceries.
   * Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.
   * We want to find out how much Keenan spends per week in a four-week month.

2. Calculate Madeline's contribution:
   * Madeline's share = 60% of the total cost
   * 60% can be written as 0.6 (60 ÷ 100 = 0.6)
   * Madeline's share = 0.6 × $400
   * Madeline's ...
