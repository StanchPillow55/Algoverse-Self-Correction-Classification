=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of Pomeranians:**
   Jana has a total of 27 puppies. According to the problem, two thirds of these puppies are Pomeranians.

   To find the number of Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = \frac{2 \times 27}{3} = \frac{54}{3} = 18
   \]

   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

2. **Determine the number of girl Pomeranians:**
   Next, we know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. We need to find out how many of the 18 Pomeranians are girls.

   To find the number of girl Pomeranians, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of girl Pomeranians} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

   Therefore, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

3. **Final answer:**
   After working through the calculations, we conclude that the number of girl Pomeranians that Jana has is:
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. We know that two thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians. 

To find two thirds of a number, we multiply that number by 2/3. 

So, we calculate 27 * 2/3 = 18. 

This means that Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of the Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls. 

To find one third of a number, we multiply that number by 1/3. 

So, we calculate 18 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jana has a total of 27 puppies.
   * Two thirds (2/3) of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.
   * One third (1/3) of the Pomeranians are girls.

2. Calculate the number of Pomeranian puppies:
   * Total puppies = 27
   * Pomeranian puppies = 2/3 of total puppies
   * Pomeranian puppies = 27 × 2/3
   * Pomeranian puppies = 18

   So, Jana has 18 Pomeranian puppies.
