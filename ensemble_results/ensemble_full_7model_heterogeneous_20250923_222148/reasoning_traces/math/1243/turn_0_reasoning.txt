=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs in cents, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.**
   - The original price of the bag is $18.00.
   - The discount is $3.00.
   - Therefore, the discounted price is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per stick of jerky.**
   - The bag contains 30 sticks of jerky.
   - To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:
     \[
     \text{Cost per Stick} = \frac{\text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Number of Sticks}} = \frac{15.00}{30}
     \]

3. **Perform the division.**
   - Calculating the division:
     \[
     \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50
     \]
   - This means each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

4. **Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert $0.50 to cents:
     \[
     \text{Cost per Stick in Cents} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the cost of each stick of jerky is **50 cents**.

Final answer: **50 cents**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- A bag of beef jerky contains 30 sticks.
- The regular price of a bag is $18.00.
- Archie buys 1 bag while it's $3.00 off the regular price.

Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.
Regular price of the bag = $18.00
Discount on the bag = $3.00
Discounted price of the bag = $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the cost per stick of beef jerky.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per stick of beef jerky in cents after applying the discount. Let's go through the steps one by one:

1. **Determine the original cost of the bag:**
   The original cost of one bag of beef jerky is $18.00.

2. **Apply the discount:**
   The discount on the bag is $3.00. Therefore, the discounted price of the bag is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 18.00...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the discounted price of the bag
* Regular price = $18.00
* Discount = $3.00
* Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

2. Now we need to find the cost per stick
* Number of sticks in bag = 30
* Cost per stick = $15.00 รท 30
* $15.00 = 1500 cents
* 1500 cents รท 30 = 50 cents per stick

Reasoning:
* I converted dollars to cents to get a whole number answer
* I divided the total cost by the numbe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the cost of the bag of beef jerky after the discount. The original price of the bag is $18.00 and the discount is $3.00. So, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

So, the cost of the bag after the discount is $15.00.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of each stick of beef jerky. The bag contains 30 sticks and costs $15.00. So, we divide the cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky.
   * The regular price of a bag is $18.00.
   * Archie buys 1 bag when they're on sale for $3.00 off the regular price.

2. Calculate the discounted price of the bag:
   * Discounted price = Regular price - Discount
   * Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00
   * Discounted price = $15.00

3. Calculate the cost of each stick of je...
