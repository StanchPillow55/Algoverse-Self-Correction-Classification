=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.

1. **Identify how many hours Harry slept**: 
   Harry slept 9 hours.

2. **Calculate how many hours James slept**: 
   James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. We can calculate this by multiplying Harry's sleep hours by \( \frac{2}{3} \).

   \[
   \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = \frac{2 \times 9}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

   So, James slept 6 hours.

3. **Find the difference in hours slept**: 
   Now, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. We do this by subtracting the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 9 - 6 = 3
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Harry slept 3 more hours than James.**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Harry slept 9 hours last night.
- James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 1: Calculate how many hours James slept.
James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
So, James slept 2/3 × 9 hours = 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
James slept 6 hours.
The difference is 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours.

Therefore...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry slept and the hours James slept.

1. **Determine how many hours James slept:**

   Harry slept for 9 hours. According to the problem, James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept. To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \) of 9 hours.

   \[
   \text{Hours James slept} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   To perform ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Harry slept 9 hours
* James slept 2/3 of Harry's sleep time

2. Calculate how long James slept:
* James's sleep = 2/3 × Harry's sleep
* James's sleep = 2/3 × 9
* James's sleep = 18/3 = 6 hours

3. Find the difference in sleep time:
* Difference = Harry's sleep - James's sleep
* Difference = 9 - 6 = 3 hours

Therefore, Harry slept 3 hours more than James.

Final answer: 3 hour...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we multiply Harry's sleep time by 2/3.

9 hours * 2/3 = 6 hours

So, James slept 6 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. To do this, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept.

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James. 

Therefore, the final answer is 3 hours.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the final answer.

Given:
- Harry slept 9 hours last night.
- James slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept.

Step 1: Calculate the number of hours James slept.
James slept 2/3 of the time Harry slept, and we know Harry slept 9 hours.
So, we need to find 2/3 of 9 hours.

2/3 × 9 = (2 ×...
