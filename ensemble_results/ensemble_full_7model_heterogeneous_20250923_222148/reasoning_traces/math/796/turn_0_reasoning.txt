=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary paid to all employees during that period.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of employees after three months

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Total number of months**: 3

**Calculation of total employees after three months**:
- After 1 month: 
  \[
  200 + 20 = 220 \text{ employees}
  \]
- After 2 months: 
  \[
  220 + 20 = 240 \text{ employees}
  \]
- After 3 months: 
  \[
  240 + 20 = 260 \text{ employees}
  \]

So, after three months, the total number of employees is **260**.

### Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to employees each month

1. **Salary per employee**: $4000
2. **Total number of employees after three months**: 260

**Calculation of total salary for the third month**:
\[
\text{Total salary for the third month} = \text{Number of employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
\]
\[
= 260 \times 4000
\]
\[
= 1,040,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total salary paid over three months

Now, we need to calculate the total salary paid over the three months. We will calculate the salary for each month based on the number of employees at the end of each month:

- **Month 1**: 200 employees
\[
\text{Total salary for Month 1} = 200 \times 4000 = 800,000
\]

- **Month 2**: 220 employees
\[
\text{Total salary for Month 2} = 220 \times 4000 = 880,000
\]

- **Month 3**: 260 employees
\[
\text{Total salary for Month 3} = 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary over the three months

Now, we sum the salaries for all three months:
\[
\text{Total salary over three months} = \text{Total salary for Month 1} + \text{Total salary for Month 2} + \text{Total salary for Month 3}
\]
\[
= 800,000 + 880,000 + 1,040,000
\]
\[
= 2,720,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$2,720,000**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the company will have hired 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 new employees.

Adding these new employees to the initial number of employees, the company will have 200 + 60 = <<200+60=260>>260 employees after three months.

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is 260 employees * $4000/employee/month * 3 months = $...
