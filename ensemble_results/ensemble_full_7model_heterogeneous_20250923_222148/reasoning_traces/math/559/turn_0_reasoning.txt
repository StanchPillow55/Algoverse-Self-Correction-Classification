=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks and how much he needs to reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Identify Octavia's coffee intake**: 
   - Let's denote the daily recommended amount of coffee as \( R \) cups.
   - According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended amount, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
     \]

2. **Calculate Juan's coffee intake**:
   - The problem states that Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan's coffee intake can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
     \]

3. **Determine the daily recommendation**:
   - The doctor has recommended that Juan reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. Thus, we have:
     \[
     \text{Recommended coffee intake for Juan} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for reduction**:
   - We need to find out how many cups Juan must reduce his coffee intake. The amount he needs to reduce can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = \text{Juan's current intake} - \text{Recommended intake}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = 5R - 4
     \]

5. **Determine the value of \( R \)**:
   - We know that Juan's current intake \( 5R \) must be greater than 4 cups since he needs to reduce it. To find the value of \( R \), we can set up the inequality:
     \[
     5R > 4
     \]
   - Solving for \( R \):
     \[
     R > \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
     \]
   - This means the daily recommended amount of coffee \( R \) must be greater than 0.8 cups.

6. **Calculate the reduction**:
   - Since we do not have a specific value for \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \):
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = 5R - 4
     \]
   - To find a specific numerical answer, we can assume \( R = 4 \) cups (the recommended amount for Juan). This gives:
     \[
     \text{Juan's current intake} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - Now we can calculate the reduction:
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
     \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by **16 cups** to meet the doctor's recommendation of 4 cups.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks per day.
2. Calculate the amount of coffee Juan drinks per day.
3. Calculate the difference between Juan's current coffee intake and the recommended daily intake.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of coffee Octavia drinks per day.
* The daily recommended cups of coffee is not given, so let's assume it is 8 cups.
* Octavia drinks half the daily recommend...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of coffee Juan currently drinks and then calculate how many cups he needs to reduce to meet the daily recommendation of 4 cups.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand Octavia's coffee consumption:**
   - Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
   - The daily recommended amount is 4 cups.
   - Therefore, Octavia drinks \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) cups of coffee per day.

2...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks
* Daily recommended amount is 4 cups
* Octavia drinks half of the recommended amount
* Octavia's intake = 4 รท 2 = 2 cups per day

2. Now let's find Juan's current coffee intake
* Juan drinks 10 times what Octavia drinks
* Juan's intake = 2 ร 10 = 20 cups per day

3. Calculate how much Juan needs to reduce
* Doctor's recommended amount = 4 cups per day
* Amo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee. Since the daily recommendation is 4 cups, Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups of coffee.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks. Therefore, Juan drinks 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups of coffee.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake by 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups.

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out by how many cups Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake, we first need to calculate how many cups of coffee both Octavia and Juan drink daily.

Given:
- The daily recommended cups of coffee is 4.
- Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee.
- Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cups of coffee Octavia drinks daily.
