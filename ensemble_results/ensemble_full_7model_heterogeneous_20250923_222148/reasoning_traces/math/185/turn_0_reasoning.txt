=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Jenna picked based on the information given about her mother.

1. **Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother**: 
   - We know from the problem that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked**: 
   - The problem states that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. 
   - Since her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mother's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked**: 
   - Now that we know how many apples each person picked, we can find the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = \text{Jenna's apples} + \text{Mother's apples} = 10 + 20
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 30
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is:
     \[
     \boxed{30}
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Mom picked 20 apples
* Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom

2. Calculate how many apples Jenna picked:
* Half of mom's apples = 20 ÷ 2
* Jenna picked 10 apples

3. Calculate total apples picked by both:
* Total = Mom's apples + Jenna's apples
* Total = 20 + 10
* Total = 30 apples

Therefore, Jenna and her mom picked 30 apples in total.

Final Answer: 30 apples

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. This means she picked 1/2 * 20 = <<1/2*20=10>>10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

So, 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30 apples.

Therefore, Jenna and her mom picked a total of 30 apples.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.
   * Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.

2. Calculate the number of apples Jenna picked:
   * Jenna's apples = 1/2 × Mom's apples
   * Jenna's apples = 1/2 × 20
   * Jenna's apples = 10

   So, Jenna picked 10 apples.

3. Calculate the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mom:
   * Total apples = Mom's apples + Jenna...
