=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many colors of crayons Beatrice bought in total, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets she purchased.

1. **Identify the number of packets and their contents**:
   - Beatrice bought **6 packets** that each contain **8 crayons**.
   - She also bought **4 packets** that each contain **16 crayons**.

2. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the first set of packets**:
   - For the 6 packets with 8 crayons each, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons from first set} = 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons/packet} = 48 \text{ crayons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the second set of packets**:
   - For the 4 packets with 16 crayons each, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons from second set} = 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons/packet} = 64 \text{ crayons}
     \]

4. **Add the total number of crayons from both sets**:
   - Now, we add the total crayons from both sets to find the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons} = 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of colors of crayons Beatrice bought is:
     \[
     \boxed{112}
     \]
