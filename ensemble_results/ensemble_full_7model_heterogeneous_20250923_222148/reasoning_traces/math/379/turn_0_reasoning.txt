=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many cookies Rachel has left after her brother ate some, we can break the problem down into a series of steps.

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel initially had:**
   - Rachel bought 23 cookies.
   - Janet gave her 42 cookies.
   
   We can add these two amounts together to find the total number of cookies Rachel had initially:
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies bought} + \text{Cookies given} = 23 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cookies} = 65
   \]

2. **Determine how many cookies Rachel's brother ate:**
   - Her brother ate 44 cookies.

3. **Calculate the number of cookies left after her brother ate some:**
   To find out how many cookies Rachel has left, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies she had:
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten by brother} = 65 - 44
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = 21
   \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations, we find that the number of cookies left for Rachel is:

\[
\boxed{21}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rachel bought 23 cookies.
- Janet gave her 42 cookies.
- Rachel's brother ate 44 of those cookies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel had.
Total cookies = Cookies Rachel bought + Cookies Janet gave
Total cookies = 23 + 42 = 65 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the number of cookies Rachel's brother ate.
Cookies eaten by Rachel's brother = 44

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of cookies Rachel had initially:
* Cookies from Rachel's purchase = 23 cookies
* Cookies from Janet = 42 cookies
* Total initial cookies = 23 + 42 = 65 cookies

2. Then, we subtract the cookies her brother ate:
* Brother ate = 44 cookies
* Remaining cookies = 65 - 44 = 21 cookies

Reasoning:
* We first add the cookies from both sources to get the total
* Then we subtract the coo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cookies Rachel has in total. She bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. 

So, we add these two amounts together:

23 cookies (from Rachel's purchase) + 42 cookies (from Janet) = 65 cookies

Next, we need to subtract the number of cookies that Rachel's brother ate from the total number of cookies Rachel has. 

Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies, so we subtract this from the total:

65 cookies (total cookies Rachel has) - 44 cookie...
