Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids, given that each adult receives a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( k \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total size for kids} = 4k
\]

Each adult receives a slice that is twice the size of a kid's slice. Therefore, the size of each adult's slice is:

\[
\text{Size of each adult's slice} = 2k
\]

Since there are 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total size for adults} = 2 \times (2k) = 4k
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total size of the slices for the kids and the adults:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4k + 4k = 8k
\]

Next, we need to determine the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives. Since each adult receives a slice of size \( 2k \), we can calculate the percentage of the total watermelon that each adult gets as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage of watermelon for each adult} = \left( \frac{\text{Size of each adult's slice}}{\text{Total size of watermelon}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage of watermelon for each adult} = \left( \frac{2k}{8k} \right) \times 100
\]

The \( k \) cancels out:

\[
\text{Percentage of watermelon for each adult} = \left( \frac{2}{8} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \times 100 = 25
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

Finally, we can state the answer:

Each adult gets **25%** of the watermelon.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets.

Given information:
- The family consists of 6 people: 2 adults and 4 kids.
- Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Step 1: Determine the total number of slices the watermelon is divided into.
Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice, we can represent the slices as follows:
- 2 adult slices (each twic...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the family members according to the given conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the size of the slice that each kid gets.
   - Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, each adult gets a slice of size \( 2x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - There are 4 kids, each getting a slice of size \( x \). Therefo...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's first establish what we know:
   * Total watermelon = 100%
   * 2 adults get twice as much as each kid
   * 4 kids get equal smaller portions
   * 2 adults + 4 kids = 6 total people

2) Let's say each kid's portion is "x"
   * Each kid gets: x
   * Each adult gets: 2x (twice as much as a kid)

3) Let's set up an equation:
   * 4 kids × x (each kid's portion) = 4x
   * 2 adults × 2x (each adult's portion) = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the size of the slice that each kid gets as "x". Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of the slice that each adult gets is "2x".

The total size of the watermelon is divided among 2 adults and 4 kids, so the total size of the watermelon is 2(2x) + 4x = 8x.

The percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets is therefore the size of the slice that each adult gets divided by the total size of the watermelon, multip...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 6 people in the family: 2 adults and 4 kids.
   * Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice.
   * We need to find the percentage of the watermelon each adult gets.

2. Let's assign a variable to represent the size of a kid's slice:
   * Let 'x' be the size of each kid's slice.

3. Express the size of an adult's slice in terms of '...
