Final Answer: To find the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.**
   - There are 50 students at the picnic.
   - Each student is given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student} = 50 \times 10 = 500
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.**
   - Mr. George eats 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.**
   - To find the total number of burritos consumed, we add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed} = \text{Total burritos consumed by students} + \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 500 + 20 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos.**
   - We started with 600 burritos. To find the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos consumed from the total number of burritos ordered:
     \[
     \text{Total leftover burritos} = \text{Total burritos ordered} - \text{Total burritos consumed} = 600 - 520 = 80
     \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \( \boxed{80} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many burritos were consumed and then subtract that number from the total number of burritos ordered to find out how many were left over.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of burritos ordered:**
   - George ordered 600 burritos.

2. **Calculate the number of burritos eaten by the students:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Total burritos ordered = 600
* Number of students = 50
* Each student gets 10 burritos
* Mr. George eats 20 burritos

2. Calculate how many burritos the students ate:
* Burritos per student = 10
* Number of students = 50
* Total student burritos = 10 × 50 = 500 burritos

3. Add Mr. George's burritos:
* Mr. George's burritos = 20
* Total burritos eaten = Student b...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many burritos were eaten by the students. 

Since each student was given ten burritos, and there were 50 students, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 10 burritos/student * 50 students = 500 burritos.

Mr. George also ate 20 burritos.

So, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500 burritos (eaten by the students) + 20 burritos (eaten by Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

George initially ordered 600 burritos. So, the nu...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There were 600 burritos ordered for the picnic.
   * 50 students attended the picnic.
   * Each student was given 10 burritos.
   * Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

2. Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students:
   * Number of students = 50
   * Burritos per student = 10
   * Total burritos given to students = Number of students × Burritos per student
