=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount spent in the first year:**
   The company spends $15,000 on advertising in the first year.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent in Year 1} = 15000
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent in the second year:**
   The company spends a third of the amount spent in the first year for the second year. To find this amount, we need to calculate one-third of $15,000.

   \[
   \text{Amount spent in Year 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:

   \[
   \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
   \]

   So, the amount spent in the second year is $5,000.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent over the two years:**
   Now, we add the amounts spent in both years to find the total advertising expenditure.

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Amount spent in Year 1} + \text{Amount spent in Year 2}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 15000 + 5000
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   15000 + 5000 = 20000
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is:

   \[
   \boxed{20000}
   \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First year advertising cost = $15,000

2. Second year advertising cost:
* Second year is one-third of first year
* $15,000 ÷ 3 = $5,000 for second year

3. Total cost for both years:
* Total = First year + Second year
* Total = $15,000 + $5,000
* Total = $20,000

Reasoning:
- The first year cost is given directly as $15,000
- The second year is described as "a third of that amount," so I divided $15,000 by 3
- To...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The company spends $15000 on advertising for the first year. 

For the second year, the company spends a third of the first year's amount. To calculate this, we divide the first year's amount by 3:

$15000 ÷ 3 = $5000

So, the company spends $5000 on advertising for the second year. 

To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amounts spent in the first and second years:

$15000 (first year) + $5000 (second year) = $20000

So, ...
