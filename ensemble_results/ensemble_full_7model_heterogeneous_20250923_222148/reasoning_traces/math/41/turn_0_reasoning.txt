=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Polly can throw the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone, and then find out how far outside the dragon's flame reach she can stand while still being able to hit the dragon.

1. **Distance Polly can throw without the gemstone**: 
   Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.

2. **Distance Polly can throw with the gemstone**: 
   When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than she can without it. Therefore, we calculate the distance as follows:
   \[
   \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Dragon's flame reach**: 
   The dragon, Perg, can breathe fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.

4. **Calculating the distance Polly can stand outside the dragon's flame reach**:
   Since the dragon's flames reach up to 1000 feet, we need to find out how far Polly can stand outside of this range while still being able to hit the dragon with her javelin.

   If Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet while holding the gemstone, we can determine the maximum distance she can stand from the dragon by subtracting the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw:
   \[
   \text{Distance outside the flame reach} = \text{Distance she can throw with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's flame reach}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance outside the flame reach} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand **200 feet** outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{200 \text{ feet}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Polly can throw the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, and then compare it to the distance of the dragon's flames to determine how far outside the reach of the flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon.

Given information:
- The dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet.
- Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet when not holding the gemstone.
- When holding...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Determine Polly's throwing distance with the gemstone:**

   Without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. The problem states that holding the sapphire gemstone allows her to throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, we calculate the new throwing distance as follow...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Dragon's flame reach = 1000 feet
* Polly's normal throw distance = 400 feet
* With gemstone, Polly can throw 3 times farther than normal

2. Calculate Polly's throw distance with the gemstone:
* Gemstone throw distance = Normal throw distance × 3
* Gemstone throw distance = 400 × 3 = 1200 feet

3. To find how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand:
* Safe...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times farther than her normal throwing distance. This means that her throwing distance becomes 3 * 400 feet = 1200 feet.

The dragon's flames reach a distance of 1000 feet. Therefore, to stay outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still be able to hit the dragon with the gold javelin, Polly needs to stand at a distance that is greater than the reach of the dragon's flames but less than or e...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The dragon can breathe fire within a distance of 1000 feet.
   * Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet without the sapphire gemstone.
   * When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther.

2. Calculate the distance Polly can throw the javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone:
   * Distance with gemstone = 3 × ...
