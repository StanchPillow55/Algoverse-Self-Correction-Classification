=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many video games Bobby has based on the information given about Brian's video games.

1. **Identify the number of video games Brian has:**
   - The problem states that Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made. 
   - Therefore, we need to calculate how many video games Brian has after losing 5:
     \[
     \text{Brian's video games after losing 5} = 20 - 5 = 15
     \]

2. **Determine Bobby's video games in relation to Brian's:**
   - The problem states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. 
   - We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( B \) represent the number of video games Bobby has. Then we can write:
     \[
     B = 3 \times (\text{Brian's video games}) - 5
     \]

3. **Substituting Brian's video games into the equation:**
   - We already calculated that Brian has 15 video games after losing 5. Now we substitute this value into the equation for Bobby:
     \[
     B = 3 \times 15 - 5
     \]

4. **Calculating Bobby's video games:**
   - First, calculate \( 3 \times 15 \):
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45
     \]
   - Now, subtract 5 from 45:
     \[
     B = 45 - 5 = 40
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Bobby has \( \boxed{40} \) video games.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Brian has 20 video games, but lost 5 right before the comparison was made.
- Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian.

Step 1: Find the number of video games Brian had before he lost 5.
Brian's original number of video games = 20 + 5 = 25 video games

Step 2: Find 3 times the number of video games Brian had before he lost 5.
3 times Brian's original number of video gam...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many video games Bobby has based on the information given about Brian's video games.

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - Brian originally had 20 video games.
   - Brian lost 5 video games right before the comparison was made.
   - Therefore, at the time of comparison, Brian has:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15 \text{ video games}
     \]

2. **Set up the relationship:**
   - Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as B...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many video games Brian has after losing 5:
   * Brian started with 20 games
   * He lost 5 games
   * 20 - 5 = 15 games remaining

2. Now, let's understand what "5 fewer than 3 times as many" means:
   * First calculate 3 times Brian's games
   * Then subtract 5 from that number

3. Calculate 3 times Brian's current games:
   * 3 Ã— 15 = 45 games

4. Subtract 5 to get Bobby's games:
   * 45 -...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after he lost 5. 

Brian originally had 20 video games, and he lost 5, so he now has 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 video games.

Next, we need to determine how many video games Bobby has. The problem tells us that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. 

So, we first need to calculate 3 times the number of video games Brian has, which is 3 * 15 = <<3*15=45>>45.

Then, since Bobby has 5 fewer th...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brian originally had 20 video games.
   * Brian lost 5 video games before the comparison was made.
   * Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times the number of video games Brian has.

2. Calculate the number of video games Brian has after losing 5:
   * Brian's current video games = Original video games - Lost video games
   * Brian's current video games = 20 - 5
   * Brian...
