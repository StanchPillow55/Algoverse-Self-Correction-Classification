=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy.

1. **Initial Order**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   
2. **Sales Made**: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies. This means he has sold more candies than he initially ordered.

3. **Additional Order**: After selling 150 candies, Dale ordered an additional 100 candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has after his additional order:

- **Total Candies Ordered**: 
   - Initial order: 100 candies
   - Additional order: 100 candies
   - Total = 100 + 100 = 200 candies

4. **Total Sold**: Dale sold 150 candies.

5. **Remaining Candies**: To find out how many candies Dale has left to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

\[
\text{Remaining Candies} = \text{Total Candies} - \text{Candies Sold}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Candies} = 200 - 150 = 50
\]

Thus, Dale still needs to sell **50 more butterscotch candies** to sell all of his candy.

**Final Answer**: Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of butterscotch candies Dale has and then subtract the number of candies he has already sold to determine how many he still needs to sell.

Given information:
- Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.
- He sold 150 butterscotch candies.
- He then ordered 100 more butterscotch candies.

Step 1: Find the total number of butterscotch candies Dale has.
Initial number of candies + Additional candi...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell after his transactions.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 candies, which means he sold more than he initially had.

2. **Understanding the Sales:**
   - Since Dale sold 150 candies but only had 100 initially, he sold 50 more candies than he had. This implies tha...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial order of candies:
* Dale started with 100 candies

2. Number of candies sold:
* Dale sold 150 candies
* This means he sold more than his initial stock

3. Additional order:
* Dale ordered 100 more candies
* So now his total inventory is:
  * Initial order + Additional order = 100 + 100 = 200 candies total

4. Calculate remaining candies to sell:
* Total candies = 200
* Already sold = 150
* Remaining to se...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. He ended up selling 150 candies. This means he sold 50 more candies than he initially had. 

When he ordered 100 more candies, this added to the 50 he still needed to sell from the previous order. 

So, to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we add the 50 candies he still needed to sell from the previous order to the 100 candies he just ordered. 

50 candies + 100 candies = 150 candies

Therefore, Dale still...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies to sell.
   * He ended up selling 150 candies, which is 50 more than he initially ordered.
   * After selling 150 candies, he ordered 100 more candies.

2. Calculate the number of candies Dale has left to sell after the first round of sales:
   * Candies left to sell = Initial order - Candies sold
   * Candies left to ...
