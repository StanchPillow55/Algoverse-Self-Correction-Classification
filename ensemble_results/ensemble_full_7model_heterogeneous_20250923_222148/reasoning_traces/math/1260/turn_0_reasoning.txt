Final Answer: To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her 210 photos, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one batch:**
   Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.

2. **Calculate the total number of batches she uploads in one day:**
   Jade uploads 6 batches each day.

3. **Calculate the total number of photos uploaded in one day:**
   To find out how many photos Jade uploads in one day, we multiply the number of photos per batch by the number of batches per day:
   \[
   \text{Photos per day} = \text{Photos per batch} \times \text{Batches per day} = 7 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   \text{Photos per day} = 42
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of days needed to upload all photos:**
   Now, we need to find out how many days it will take Jade to upload all 210 photos. We do this by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos she uploads per day:
   \[
   \text{Days needed} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Photos per day}} = \frac{210}{42}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Days needed} = 5
   \]

Thus, Jade will need **5 days** to upload all of her photos.

Final answer: **5 days**.
