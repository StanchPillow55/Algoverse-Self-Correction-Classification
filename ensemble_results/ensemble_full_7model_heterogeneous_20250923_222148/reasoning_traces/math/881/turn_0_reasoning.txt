=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we first need to determine Melanie's current age based on the information given.

1. **Determine Melanie's current age**:
   We know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. Therefore, we can calculate her current age by subtracting 10 from 18:

   \[
   \text{Current Age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Define Melanie's present age**:
   Let \( x \) be Melanie's current age. From our calculation, we have:

   \[
   x = 8
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for thrice her present age**:
   We need to find out in how many years Melanie's age will be three times her current age. Three times her current age is:

   \[
   3x = 3 \times 8 = 24
   \]

4. **Define the variable for the number of years**:
   Let \( y \) be the number of years from now when Melanie's age will be 24. In \( y \) years, Melanie's age will be:

   \[
   x + y = 8 + y
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**:
   We want to find \( y \) such that:

   \[
   8 + y = 24
   \]

6. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   To find \( y \), we can rearrange the equation:

   \[
   y = 24 - 8
   \]
   \[
   y = 16
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between Melanie's present age and the age when her age will be thrice her present age.

Given information:
- In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.

Step 1: Find Melanie's present age.
Melanie's age in 10 years - 10 years = Melanie's present age
18 years - 10 years = 8 years

Step 2: Set up an equation to find the number of years when Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.
Let x be the...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Melanie's current age and then find out how many years it will take for her age to be three times her current age.

### Step 1: Determine Melanie's Current Age

We are given that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. We can use this information to find her current age.

Let \( x \) be Melanie's current age. According to the problem:

\[ x + 10 = 18 \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation:

\[ x = 18 - 10 \]
\[ x = 8 \]
...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's find Melanie's current age
* In 10 years, she will be 18
* So her current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

2) Let's say it will take x years for her age to be thrice her current age
* Current age = 8
* After x years, her age will be: 8 + x
* This should equal three times her current age: 3 Ã— 8 = 24

3) We can write an equation:
* 8 + x = 24
* x = 24 - 8
* x = 16

4) Let's verify:
* Current age = 8
* Afte...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Melanie's current age is 18 years - 10 years = 8 years old.

Let's denote the number of years in which Melanie's age will be thrice her present age as X. 

This means that in X years, Melanie's age will be 8 years + X years = 3 * 8 years.

Solving this equation will give us the value of X:

8 + X = 24,
X = 24 - 8,
X = 16.

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years.
   * We need to find out in how many years her age will be three times her current age.

2. Find Melanie's current age:
   * If Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, we can subtract 10 from 18 to find her current age.
   * Current age = 18 - 10 = 8 years old

3. Let's say the number of years it will take for Melanie's...
