=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:**
   We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #2 will win} = 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining people:**
   After accounting for the 10 people who think horse #2 will win, we find the remaining number of people:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:**
   We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #7 will win} = 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win:**
   Now, we need to find out how many people think horse #12 will win. We already know that there are 40 remaining people, and 24 of them think horse #7 will win. Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #12 will win} = \text{Remaining people} - \text{People who think horse #7 will win} = 40 - 24 = 16
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The number of people who think that horse #12 will win is:
   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win:
   * 20% of 50 = 0.20 x 50 = 10 people think horse #2 will win

2. Now we need to find the remaining number of people:
   * Total people = 50
   * People who think horse #2 will win = 10
   * Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people

3. 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win:
   * 60% of 40 = 0.60 x 40 = 24 people think horse #7 will win

4. Now we ne...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people think horse #12 will win the big race. We will do this by calculating the number of people who think each horse will win and then using these numbers to find out how many are left for horse #12.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win.

We know that 20% of the 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find this number, we calculate 20% of 50:

\[
20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many people think horse #2 will win
* 20% of 50 people = 0.20 × 50 = 10 people think horse #2 will win

2. Next, let's find how many people remain after horse #2 voters
* Remaining people = Total people - Horse #2 voters
* Remaining people = 50 - 10 = 40 people remain

3. Now, let's find how many of the remaining people think horse #7 will win
* 60% of 40 people = 0.60 × 40 = 24 people think...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We do this by calculating 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 is calculated as follows:
20/100 * 50 = 10

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

Next, we subtract this number from the total number of people to find out how many people are left. 

50 - 10 = 40

So, 40 people are left.

Then, we find out how many of these remaining people think horse #7 will win. We do this by calculating 60% of 40.

60% of 40 is calcu...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 50 people in total.
   * 20% of the people think horse #2 will win.
   * 60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win.
   * The rest of the people think horse #12 will win.

2. Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:
   * 20% of 50 people = 0.2 × 50 = 10 people
   * So, 10 people think horse #2 will win.

3. Calculate the numb...
