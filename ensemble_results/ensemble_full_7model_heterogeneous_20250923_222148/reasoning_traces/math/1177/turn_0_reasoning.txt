=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Albert's class are not on varsity. We start by identifying the total number of boys and girls in the class and then calculate how many of them are on varsity.

1. **Identify the total number of boys and girls:**
   - Number of boys = 12
   - Number of girls = 12

2. **Calculate the number of girls on varsity:**
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity. 
   - Number of girls on varsity = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4\)

3. **Calculate the number of boys on varsity:**
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3\)

4. **Calculate the total number of students on varsity:**
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity
   - Total students on varsity = \(4 + 3 = 7\)

5. **Calculate the total number of students in the class:**
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls
   - Total students = \(12 + 12 = 24\)

6. **Calculate the number of students not on varsity:**
   - Students not on varsity = Total students - Total students on varsity
   - Students not on varsity = \(24 - 7 = 17\)

Therefore, the number of students who are not on varsity is \( \boxed{17} \).

One-third of the girls are on varsity. Since there are 12 girls, we calculate 1/3 * 12 = 4 girls are on varsity.

For the boys: 
One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. Since there are 12 boys, we calculate 1/4 * 12 = 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, we need to find out how many students are not on varsity.
