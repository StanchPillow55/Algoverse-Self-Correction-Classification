=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then sum those amounts to find the total.

1. **Identify the amounts raised by Alexandra and Kim:**
   - Alexandra raises $430.
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
     \]

2. **Identify the amounts raised by Sarah and Maryam:**
   - Sarah raises $300.
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
     \]

3. **Now we have the amounts raised by each girl:**
   - Alexandra: $430
   - Kim: $750
   - Sarah: $300
   - Maryam: $700

4. **Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls:**
   We sum the amounts raised by each girl:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
   \]

5. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   - First, add Alexandra's and Kim's amounts:
     \[
     430 + 750 = 1180
     \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
     \[
     1180 + 300 = 1480
     \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
     \[
     1480 + 700 = 2180
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   The total amount of money raised by all the girls is:
   \[
   \boxed{2180} \text{ dollars}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra.
- Alexandra raises $430.
- Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah.
- Sarah raises $300.

Step 1: Calculate how much Kim raised.
Kim's amount = Alexandra's amount + $320
Kim's amount = $430 + $320 = $750

Step 2: Calculate how much Maryam raised.
Maryam's amount = Sarah's amount + $400
Maryam's amount = $300 + $400 = $700

Step 3: Calculate the tota...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Alexandra raised $430
* Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra
* Sarah raised $300
* Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah

2. Let's calculate how much Kim raised:
* Kim = Alexandra's amount + $320
* Kim = $430 + $320
* Kim = $750

3. Let's calculate how much Maryam raised:
* Maryam = Sarah's amount + $400
* Maryam = $300 + $400
* Maryam = $700

4. Now we can add up all amounts:
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430. So, to find out how much Kim raises, we add $320 to Alexandra's total:

$430 (Alexandra's total) + $320 = $750

So, Kim raises $750.

Next, we know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. So, to find out how much Maryam raises, we add $400 to Sarah's total:

$300 (Sarah's total) + $400 = $700

So, Maryam raises $700.

Now, to find out how...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Alexandra raises $430
   * Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra
   * Sarah raises $300
   * Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah

2. Calculate how much money Kim raises:
