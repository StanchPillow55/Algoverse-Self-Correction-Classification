=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to analyze the prices of the other packages and establish the relationship between the number of sandwiches and their prices.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities of the packages:**
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches (price unknown)

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:**
   - For Package 1:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   - For Package 2:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

3. **Establish that the price per sandwich is consistent:**
   Since both packages have the same price per sandwich ($1.5), we can conclude that the pricing is proportional across the different package sizes.

4. **Calculate the price for the package with 8 sandwiches:**
   To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the number of sandwiches by the price per sandwich:
   \[
   \text{Price for 8 sandwiches} = 8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is \(\boxed{12}\) dollars.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price, and then use it to calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Given information:
- Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
- Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
- Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

Step 1: Find the cost per sandwich.
Cost per sandwich = Price of the package / Number of sandwiches in the package

For Package 1:
Cost per sandw...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, given that the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches in each package.

First, let's understand what it means for the prices to be proportional to the number of sandwiches. This means that the price per sandwich should be the same across all packages.

Let's calculate the price per sandwich for the first two packages:

1. **First Package:**
   - Number of sandwiches: 2
   ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what "prices are proportional" means:
   * This means the price per sandwich should be the same for all packages

2) Let's find the price per sandwich for the first two packages:
   * Package 1: $3 for 2 sandwiches
   * Price per sandwich = $3 รท 2 = $1.50 per sandwich

   * Package 2: $6 for 4 sandwiches
   * Price per sandwich = $6 รท 4 = $1.50 per sandwich

3) We can verify the prices are...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the prices of the sandwiches are proportional to the number of sandwiches in the package. This means that the price per sandwich is constant across all packages.

We can determine the price per sandwich by dividing the total price of a package by the number of sandwiches in that package. 

For the first package, the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich.

For the second package, the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   * Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   * Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price unknown
   * The prices are proportional

2. Check if the prices are indeed proportional:
   * Package 1: $3 รท 2 sandwiches = $1.5 per sandwich
   * Package 2: $6 รท 4 sandwiches = $1.5 per sandwich
   * The prices are proportional because the cost per sandwich i...
