=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the problem**:
   - Let \( N \) be the number of candies Nick has.
   - Let \( G \) be the number of candies George has.

2. **Setting up the relationships**:
   - According to the problem, Nick had twice as many candies as George. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     N = 2G
     \]

3. **Considering the change in George's candies**:
   - George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left. We can express this as:
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]

4. **Solving for George's initial number of candies**:
   - To find \( G \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     G = 3 + 5
     \]
     \[
     G = 8
     \]

5. **Finding the number of candies Nick has**:
   - Now that we know \( G = 8 \), we can substitute this value back into the equation for \( N \):
     \[
     N = 2G = 2 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     N = 16
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of candies Nick has is \( \boxed{16} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nick had twice as many candies as George.
- George then ate 5 candies.
- George now has 3 candies left.

Step 1: Find out how many candies George had initially.
George has 3 candies left, so he must have had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before he ate 5.

Step 2: Find out how many candies Nick had initially.
Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, and George had 8 candies, then Nick must have...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many candies Nick has based on the information given about George's candies.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many candies George originally had:**
   - We know that after eating 5 candies, George has 3 candies left.
   - Therefore, before eating the candies, George must have had:
     \[
     3 \text{ (candies left)} + 5 \text{ (candies eaten)} = 8 \text{ candies}
     \]

2. **Determine how ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* George has 3 candies left after eating 5 candies
* Nick had twice as many candies as George initially

2. First, let's find how many candies George had at the beginning:
* Current candies + Eaten candies = Initial candies
* 3 + 5 = 8 candies initially

3. Now we can find Nick's candies:
* Nick had twice as many as George's initial amount
* Nick's candies = 2 Ã— George's initial can...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many candies George had before he ate 5. Since he has 3 left after eating 5, he must have had 3 + 5 = 8 candies before.

Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick must have had 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

The problem doesn't say that Nick ate any of his candies, so he still has all 16. 

So, Nick has 16 candies.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Initially, Nick had twice as many candies as George.
   * George ate 5 candies.
   * After eating 5 candies, George now has 3 candies left.

2. Find the number of candies George had initially:
   * George's current candies + Candies George ate = George's initial candies
   * 3 + 5 = 8
   * So, George had 8 candies initially.

3. Find the number of candies Nick has:
