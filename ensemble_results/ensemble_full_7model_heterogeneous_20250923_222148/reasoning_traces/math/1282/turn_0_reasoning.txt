=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests.**
   John invited 20 people to the party.

2. **Determine how many hot dogs each guest will eat.**
   Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs. Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed for all guests is:
   \[
   \text{Total hot dogs needed} = \text{Number of guests} \times \text{Hot dogs per guest} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

3. **Account for the hot dogs already available.**
   John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party. We need to subtract these from the total needed:
   \[
   \text{Hot dogs to buy} = \text{Total hot dogs needed} - \text{Hot dogs already available} = 40 - 4 = 36 \text{ hot dogs}
   \]

4. **Determine how many packs of hot dogs are needed.**
   Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs. To find out how many packs John needs to buy, we divide the number of hot dogs he needs by the number of hot dogs per pack:
   \[
   \text{Packs needed} = \frac{\text{Hot dogs to buy}}{\text{Hot dogs per pack}} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ packs}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for the packs of hot dogs.**
   Each pack costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 6 packs is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Packs needed} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Finally, after working through all the calculations, we find that John needs to spend a total of **$12** on hot dogs.

**Final Answer: $12**

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional hot dogs John needs to buy and then calculate the cost based on the number of packs required.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the total number of hot dogs needed:**
   - John invited 20 people to the party.
   - Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   - Therefore, the total number of hot dogs needed is:
     \[
     20 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ hot dogs per guest} = 40 \text{ hot dogs}
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Calculate total hot dogs needed:
* Number of guests = 20
* Each guest eats 2 hot dogs
* Total hot dogs needed = 20 guests × 2 hot dogs = 40 hot dogs

2. Account for hot dogs already on hand:
* Hot dogs already have = 4
* Additional hot dogs needed = 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs

3. Calculate number of packs needed:
* Each pack contains 6 hot dogs
* Number of packs = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 packs

4. Calculate total cost:
* Cost per p...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many hot dogs John needs in total. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, he needs 2 * 20 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack of hot dogs costs $2, so in total, John needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

Therefore, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs for the part...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John invited 20 people to the party.
   * Each guest will eat 2 hot dogs.
   * John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party.
   * A pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs and costs $2.

2. Calculate the total number of hot dogs needed:
   * Number of guests = 20
   * Hot dogs per guest = 2
   * Total hot dogs needed = Number of guests × Hot dogs per guest
