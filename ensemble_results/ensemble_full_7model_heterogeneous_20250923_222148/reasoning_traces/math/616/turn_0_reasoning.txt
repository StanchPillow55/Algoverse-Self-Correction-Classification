=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks, we will analyze the growth of the beanstalk week by week.

1. **Initial Height (Week 1)**:
   - After the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.

2. **Height After Week 2**:
   - The problem states that the beanstalk doubled in height during the second week. 
   - To find the height at the end of the second week, we multiply the height at the end of the first week by 2:
     \[
     \text{Height after Week 2} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Height After Week 3**:
   - In the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches.
   - To find the total height at the end of the third week, we add the growth in the third week to the height at the end of the second week:
     \[
     \text{Height after Week 3} = 6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches}
     \]

Now, we have calculated the height of the beanstalk after each week:

- After Week 1: 3 inches
- After Week 2: 6 inches
- After Week 3: 10 inches

Thus, the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is:

\[
\boxed{10} \text{ inches}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
- In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height.
- In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the beanstalk after the second week.
Height after the first week = 3 inches
Height after the second week = 3 inches × 2 = 6 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the beanstalk after the third week...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the beanstalk at the end of each week and then determine its final height after 3 weeks.

**Week 1:**
- Initially, at the end of the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.

**Week 2:**
- During the second week, the beanstalk doubles in height. 
- To find the height at the end of the second week, we take the height at the end of the first week and multiply it by 2.
- Calculation: \(3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First week height:
* Initial height = 3 inches

2. Second week growth:
* Doubled means multiply by 2
* Height after week 2 = 3 × 2 = 6 inches

3. Third week growth:
* Added 4 more inches
* Height after week 3 = 6 + 4 = 10 inches

Let me verify by listing the growth:
* Week 1: 3 inches
* Week 2: Doubled to 6 inches
* Week 3: Added 4 inches to reach 10 inches

Final Answer: The beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how tall the beanstalk was after the second week. Since it doubled in height, we multiply the first week's height by 2. 

3 inches * 2 = 6 inches

So, the beanstalk was 6 inches tall after the second week.

In the third week, the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches. We add this to the height from the second week to find the total height after three weeks.

6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after three weeks...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll calculate the beanstalk's height for each week and then add them together to find the final height after 3 weeks.

Given:
- After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.
- It doubled in height the second week.
- It grew another 4 inches in the third week.

Step 1: Height after the first week
Height after 1st week = 3 inches

Step 2: Height after the second week
The beanstalk doubled in height ...
