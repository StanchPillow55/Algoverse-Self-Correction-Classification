=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total population**: The total number of inhabitants in Soda is given as 23,786.

2. **Identify the number of men and women**: 
   - The number of men is 8,417.
   - The number of women is 9,092.

3. **Calculate the total number of adults (men and women)**:
   We will add the number of men and women together:
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 8417 + 9092
   \]

   Performing the addition:
   \[
   8417 + 9092 = 17509
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of children**:
   To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Total adults} = 23786 - 17509
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   23786 - 17509 = 6277
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The number of children in the city of Soda is \( \boxed{6277} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let me identify the important information:
* Total population = 23786 inhabitants
* Number of men = 8417
* Number of women = 9092
* We need to find the number of children

2) To find the number of children:
* Total population = Men + Women + Children
* Therefore: Children = Total population - (Men + Women)

3) Let me calculate:
* Children = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
* Children = 23786 - 17509
* Children = 6277...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total population of Soda is 23786. This population is made up of men, women, and children. 

The number of men is given as 8417 and the number of women is given as 9092. 

To find the number of children, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population. 

So, the calculation will be as follows:

Total population - number of men - number of women = number of children

23786 (total population) - 8417 (men) - 9092 (women) = number of children
