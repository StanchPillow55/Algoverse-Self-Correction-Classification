=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total cost of John's physical therapy, we need to break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of weeks John went to therapy**: 
   - John went to physical therapy for **6 weeks**.

2. **Determine the number of sessions per week**: 
   - He attended therapy **twice a week**.

3. **Calculate the total number of sessions**:
   \[
   \text{Total sessions} = \text{Number of weeks} \times \text{Sessions per week} = 6 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 12 \text{ sessions}
   \]

4. **Determine the duration of each session**: 
   - Each session lasted **2 hours**.

5. **Calculate the total number of hours of therapy**:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Total sessions} \times \text{Hours per session} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Identify the cost per hour of therapy**: 
   - The cost of therapy is **$125 per hour**.

7. **Calculate the total cost of therapy**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Cost per hour} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 3000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's physical therapy over the 6 weeks is **$3000**.

**Final Answer**: $3000

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* 6 weeks of therapy
* 2 sessions per week
* 2 hours per session
* Cost is $125 per hour

2. Let's calculate total hours:
* Hours per week = 2 sessions × 2 hours = 4 hours per week
* Total hours = 4 hours/week × 6 weeks = 24 total hours

3. Calculate total cost:
* Cost per hour = $125
* Total cost = Total hours × Cost per hour
* Total cost = 24 hours × $125/hour = $3,000...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. He went twice a week for 6 weeks, which is 2*6 = 12 sessions. Each session lasted 2 hours, so he spent a total of 12*2 = 24 hours in physical therapy.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the therapy. If each hour cost $125, then the total cost would be 24*$125 = $3000.

So, John's physical therapy cost him $3000.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.
   * Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.
   * The cost of each therapy session is $125 per hour.

2. Calculate the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy:
   * Hours per session = 2
   * Sessions per week = 2
   * Total weeks = 6
   * Total hours = Hours per session × Sessions per ...
