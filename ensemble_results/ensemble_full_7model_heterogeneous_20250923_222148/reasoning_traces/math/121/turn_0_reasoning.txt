=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of fruits Morisette brought.**

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits Morisette brought:

\[
\text{Total fruits by Morisette} = \text{Number of apples} + \text{Number of oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Total fruits by Morisette} = 5 + 8 = 13
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of fruits Kael brought.**

Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

- Apples brought by Kael:
\[
\text{Apples by Kael} = 2 \times \text{Apples by Morisette} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

- Oranges brought by Kael:
\[
\text{Oranges by Kael} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Oranges by Morisette} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
\]

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits Kael brought:

\[
\text{Total fruits by Kael} = \text{Number of apples} + \text{Number of oranges}
\]
\[
\text{Total fruits by Kael} = 10 + 4 = 14
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael.**

Now we can add the total fruits brought by Morisette and Kael:

\[
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Total fruits by Morisette} + \text{Total fruits by Kael}
\]
\[
\text{Total fruits} = 13 + 14 = 27
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have together is \( \boxed{27} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael.

Given information:
- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

Step 1: Find the number of apples and oranges brought by Kael.
Apples brought by Kael = 2 × 5 = 10 apples
Oranges brought by Kael = 1/2 × 8 = 4 oranges

Step 2: Find the total number of fruits brought by ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of fruits brought by Morisette and Kael.

**Step 1: Determine the number of fruits Morisette brought.**

Morisette brought:
- 5 apples
- 8 oranges

The total number of fruits Morisette brought is the sum of the apples and oranges:
\[ 5 \text{ apples} + 8 \text{ oranges} = 13 \text{ fruits} \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of fruits Kael brought.**

According to the problem:
- Kael brought twice the number of ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what Morisette brought:
* Morisette's apples = 5
* Morisette's oranges = 8

2. Now, let's calculate what Kael brought:
* Kael's apples = 2 × Morisette's apples = 2 × 5 = 10 apples
* Kael's oranges = ½ × Morisette's oranges = ½ × 8 = 4 oranges

3. Let's calculate the total fruits by adding all fruits together:
* Total apples = Morisette's apples + Kael's apples = 5 + 10 = 15 apples
* Total or...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many fruits Morisette brought. She brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so in total, she brought 5 + 8 = 13 fruits.

Next, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought. Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which means he brought 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges. So in total, Kael brought 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 fruits.

Finally, ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael have together.

Given:
- Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
- Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette.

Step 1: Determine the number of apples Kael brought.
Kael's apples = 2 × Mori...
