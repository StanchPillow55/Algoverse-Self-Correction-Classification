=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to break down his carrot consumption based on the days of the week.

1. **Identify the number of weekdays and weekend days:**
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).

2. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on weekdays:**
   - Mason eats 4 carrots each weekday.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekdays} = \text{Number of weekdays} \times \text{Carrots per weekday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekdays} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ carrots}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of carrots eaten on weekends:**
   - Mason eats 5 carrots each weekend day.
   - Therefore, the total number of carrots eaten on weekends can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekends} = \text{Number of weekend days} \times \text{Carrots per weekend day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Carrots on weekends} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ carrots}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of carrots eaten in a week:**
   - Now, we add the total number of carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends:
     \[
     \text{Total carrots in a week} = \text{Carrots on weekdays} + \text{Carrots on weekends}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total carrots in a week} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ carrots}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Mason eats a total of **30 carrots** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On Saturday and Sunday, Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on the weekend is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the weekend. 

So, 20 carrots (weekdays...
