Final Answer: To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run for, we can break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total runtime of the final concert**: The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes.

2. **Identify the encore duration**: At the end of the concert, Elaina performs a 15-minute encore.

3. **Calculate the runtime of the main concert**: Since the total runtime of the final concert includes both the main concert and the encore, we can find the runtime of the main concert by subtracting the encore duration from the total runtime:
   \[
   \text{Runtime of main concert} = \text{Total runtime} - \text{Encore duration}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Runtime of main concert} = 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Relate the main concert runtime to usual concert runtime**: The problem states that this final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. Let \( x \) represent the length of her usual concerts in minutes. Therefore, we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   2x = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the length of Elaina's usual concerts is 25 minutes.

**Final Answer**: Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts.

Given information:
- Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
- The final concert includes a 15-minute encore.
- The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

Step 1: Find the duration of the final concert without the encore.
Total runtime of the final concert - Duration of the encore = Duration of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of Elaina's usual concerts given the information about her final concert.

Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concert as \( x \) minutes.

According to the problem, the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, and there is an additional 15-minute encore at the end. The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

1. The length of...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* The final concert is twice as long as usual concerts
* The final concert has a 15-minute encore
* The total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes

2) Let's say her usual concert length is x minutes
* The final concert is twice that length: 2x minutes
* Plus the 15-minute encore
* Total final concert time = 2x + 15 = 65 minutes

3) Now we can solve for x:
* 2x + 15 = 65
* 2x = 6...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concerts as x. According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, plus a 15-minute encore. This can be represented as:

2x + 15 = 65

We can solve this equation for x to find the length of Elaina's usual concerts. First, subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Then, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Elaina's final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts.
   * She performs a 15-minute encore at the end of the final concert.
   * The total runtime of the final concert, including the encore, is 65 minutes.

2. Let's define a variable for the length of her usual concerts:
   * Let x = the length of Elaina's usual concerts in minutes.

3. Express the lengt...
