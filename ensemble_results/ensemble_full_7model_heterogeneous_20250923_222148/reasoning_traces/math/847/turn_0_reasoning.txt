=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that she invested $300 at a simple interest rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step 1: Determine the interest rate
The problem states that the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year. 

First, we need to convert "three-quarters of the original amount" into a percentage. 

Three-quarters can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{3}{4} = 0.75
\]

This means that the interest rate is 75% of the original investment amount per year.

### Step 2: Calculate the annual interest
Next, we calculate the annual interest earned on the investment. The formula for simple interest is:
\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $300
- Rate = 0.75 (which is 75%)
- Time = 1 year (since we will calculate the interest for each year)

Calculating the annual interest:
\[
\text{Annual Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 1 = 300 \times 0.75 = 225
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total interest over 3 years
Since the interest is simple interest, it will be the same each year. Therefore, over 3 years, the total interest will be:
\[
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Annual Interest} \times \text{Number of Years} = 225 \times 3 = 675
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total amount after 3 years
Now, we add the total interest earned over 3 years to the original investment to find the total amount Brenda will have:
\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest} = 300 + 675 = 975
\]

### Final Answer
After 3 years, Brenda will have a total of **$975**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, including the initial investment and the accumulated simple interest.

Given information:
- Brenda invested $300.
- The simple interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.
- The time period is 3 years.

Step 1: Calculate the simple interest earned each year.
Simple interest per year = Principal × Interest rate
Simple interest per year = $30...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, given that she invested $300 into a scheme that accumulates simple interest at the rate of three-quarters of the original amount per year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand Simple Interest:**
   Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
   \]
   where:
   - \( P \) is the principal amount (initial investment)...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify what we know:
   * Initial investment (Principal) = $300
   * Interest rate = three-quarters (3/4 or 0.75 or 75%) per year
   * Time = 3 years
   * Using simple interest formula: A = P(1 + rt)
     where A = final amount, P = principal, r = interest rate, t = time

2) Let's plug these values into the formula:
   * A = $300(1 + 0.75 × 3)
   * A = $300(1 + 2.25)
   * A = $300 × 3.25

3) Calcul...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years.

In this case, Brenda's principal (P) is $300, the rate of interest (R) is three-quarters or 0.75 (expressed as a decimal), and the time (T) is 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

I = PRT
I = 300 * 0.75 * 3
I = $675

This is the amount of interest that Brenda will earn over ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Brenda invested $300 initially.
   * The scheme accumulates simple interest.
   * The interest rate is three-quarters (3/4 or 75%) of the original amount per year.
   * We need to find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years.

2. Calculate the annual interest:
   * Annual interest = Original amount × Interest rate
   * Annual interest = $300 × 3/4
   * Annual i...
