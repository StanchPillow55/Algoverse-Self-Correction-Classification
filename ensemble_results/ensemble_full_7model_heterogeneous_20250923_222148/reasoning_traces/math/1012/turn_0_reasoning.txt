=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park as \( C \) (in percentage).

### Step 1: Calculate the charge after the first 5 hours
During the first 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, the total percentage lost after 5 hours is:

\[
\text{Total loss after 5 hours} = 5 \times 9\% = 45\%
\]

Thus, the remaining charge after 5 hours is:

\[
\text{Remaining charge after 5 hours} = C - 45\%
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the charge after the next 3 hours
After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. The total percentage lost during these 3 hours is:

\[
\text{Total loss after 3 hours} = 3 \times 7\% = 21\%
\]

Now, we need to calculate the remaining charge after these 3 hours. The charge at the start of this period was \( C - 45\% \), so after losing 21%, the remaining charge becomes:

\[
\text{Remaining charge after 3 more hours} = (C - 45\%) - 21\%
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Remaining charge after 3 more hours} = C - 45\% - 21\% = C - 66\%
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation
According to the problem, the remaining charge after all the hours is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
C - 66\% = 28\%
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( C \)
To find \( C \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
C = 28\% + 66\%
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
C = 94\%
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was \( \boxed{94\%} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final charge remaining of 28% to find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park.

Given information:
- The power bank was losing 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
- After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of the total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours.
- The final charge remaining was 28%.

Step 1: Calculate the charge remaining af...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park. We know the power bank loses charge at different rates over time, and we have the final charge percentage. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went to the park (in percentage).

### Step 2: Calculate Charge Loss Over Time
1. **First 5 hours:**
   - The power bank...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's work backwards from the final charge (28%) to find the initial charge.
   * We know the final charge is 28%
   * We need to account for two periods of discharge:
     - First: 3 hours losing 7% per hour
     - Second: 5 hours losing 9% per hour

2) Let's first add back the 3 hours at 7% per hour:
   * 3 hours Ã— 7% = 21% total loss in this period
   * 28% + 21% = 49% 
   * So before these 3 hours, the charge...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the total capacity of the power bank as 100%. 

Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. That's a total of 5 * 9% = 45% of the total capacity.

Then, the power bank started to lose 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. That's a total of 3 * 7% = 21% of the total capacity.

So, in total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its total capacity.

At the end, the charge remaining was 28% of the total capacity. This...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the important information given in the problem.

Given:
- Maria's power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours.
- After 5 hours, the power bank started losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours.
- At the end, the charge remaining was 28%.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of charge lost during the first 5 hours.
