=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many blue jellybeans are in the jar, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of green jellybeans**: 
   We know from the problem that there are 17 green jellybeans.

2. **Determine the number of red jellybeans**: 
   The problem states that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Therefore, we can calculate the number of red jellybeans as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 2 \times \text{Number of green jellybeans} = 2 \times 17 = 34
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of jellybeans that are not blue**: 
   Now, we can find the total number of jellybeans that are either green or red by adding the number of green and red jellybeans together:
   \[
   \text{Total non-blue jellybeans} = \text{Number of green jellybeans} + \text{Number of red jellybeans} = 17 + 34 = 51
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of jellybeans in the jar**: 
   The problem states that there are a total of 60 jellybeans in the jar.

5. **Calculate the number of blue jellybeans**: 
   To find the number of blue jellybeans, we subtract the total number of non-blue jellybeans from the total number of jellybeans:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue jellybeans} = \text{Total jellybeans} - \text{Total non-blue jellybeans} = 60 - 51 = 9
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **9 blue jellybeans** in the jar.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 17 green jelly beans in the jar.
- There are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans.
- The remaining jelly beans are blue.
- There are a total of 60 jelly beans in the jar.

Step 1: Find the number of red jelly beans.
Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:
Number of red jelly bean...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of blue jellybeans in the jar. We know the following:

1. There are 17 green jellybeans.
2. There are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans.
3. The total number of jellybeans is 60.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of red jellybeans

The problem states that there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans. Since there are 17 green jellybeans, we can ca...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* There are 17 green jellybeans
* There are twice as many red jellybeans as green ones
* The rest are blue jellybeans
* Total jellybeans = 60

2. Let's calculate the number of red jellybeans:
* Red jellybeans = 2 × green jellybeans
* Red jellybeans = 2 × 17 = 34 red jellybeans

3. Now we can find blue jellybeans:
* Total = Green + Red + Blue
* 60 = 17 + 34 + Blue
* 60 = 51 + Bl...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many red jellybeans there are. Since there are twice as many red jellybeans as green jellybeans, and there are 17 green jellybeans, we multiply 17 by 2 to find the number of red jellybeans.

17 * 2 = 34 red jellybeans

Now, let's find out how many green and red jellybeans there are in total. We add the number of green jellybeans (17) to the number of red jellybeans (34).

17 + 34 = 51 green and red jellybeans

We know that there are 60 jellybeans...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 17 green jellybeans in the jar.
   * The number of red jellybeans is twice the number of green jellybeans.
   * The rest of the jellybeans are blue.
   * The total number of jellybeans in the jar is 60.

2. Calculate the number of red jellybeans:
   * Red jellybeans = 2 × Green jellybeans
   * Red jellybeans = 2 × 17
   * Red jellybeans = 34

3. Calculate ...
