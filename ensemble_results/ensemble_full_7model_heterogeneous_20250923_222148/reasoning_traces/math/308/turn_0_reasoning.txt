=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much you will save by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we need to calculate the original costs and the discounted costs for both items, then find the total savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ice cream

1. **Original cost of one tub of ice cream**: $13
2. **Discounted cost of one tub of ice cream**: $11

**Savings per tub of ice cream**:
\[
\text{Savings per tub} = \text{Original cost} - \text{Discounted cost} = 13 - 11 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total savings for 2 tubs of ice cream**:
\[
\text{Total savings for ice cream} = \text{Savings per tub} \times \text{Number of tubs} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of milk

1. **Original cost of one packet of milk**: Let's assume the original price is \( P \) dollars (the problem does not provide this value).
2. **Discounted cost of one packet of milk**: \( P - 0.5 \)

**Savings per packet of milk**:
\[
\text{Savings per packet} = 0.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total savings for 4 packets of milk**:
\[
\text{Total savings for milk} = \text{Savings per packet} \times \text{Number of packets} = 0.5 \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total savings

Now, we can add the total savings from both the ice cream and the milk:

\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Total savings for ice cream} + \text{Total savings for milk} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk is:
\[
\boxed{6} \text{ dollars}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The original price of a tub of ice cream is $13.
- The discounted price of a tub of ice cream is $11.
- The original price of a packet of milk is unknown, but it is sold at a discount of $0.5.
- You want to buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

Step 1: Calculate the savings on the 2 tubs of ice cream.
Original price of 2 tubs of ice cream = 2 × $13 = $26
Discounted price...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the savings from buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk at their discounted prices compared to their original prices.

**Step 1: Calculate the savings on the tubs of ice cream.**

- Original price of one tub of ice cream = $13
- Discounted price of one tub of ice cream = $11

The savings on one tub of ice cream is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Savings per tub} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discounted price} = 13 -...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the savings on one tub of ice cream:
* Original price = $13
* Sale price = $11
* Savings per tub = $13 - $11 = $2 savings per tub

2. Calculate savings for 2 tubs of ice cream:
* Savings for 2 tubs = $2 × 2 = $4 total savings on ice cream

3. For milk packets:
* Savings per packet = $0.50
* Need to calculate for 4 packets
* Savings for milk = $0.50 × 4 = $2 total savings on milk

4. Calculate to...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much you save when you buy one tub of ice cream. 

The original price of the ice cream is $13, and it's now being sold for $11. 

So, the savings for one tub of ice cream is $13 - $11 = $2.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, you will save 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, let's calculate how much you save when you buy one packet of milk. 

The milk is sold at a discount of $0.5. 

So, if you buy 4 packets of milk, you will save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

Finally, let's ad...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step and solve it:

Given information:
- A tub of ice cream originally costs $13, but is now sold at $11.
- A packet of milk is sold at a discount of $0.5.
- We need to calculate the total savings when buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.

Step 1: Calculate the discount on each tub of ice cream.
Original price - Discounted price = Discount
$13 - $11 = $2
So, the discount on each tub of ice cream ...
