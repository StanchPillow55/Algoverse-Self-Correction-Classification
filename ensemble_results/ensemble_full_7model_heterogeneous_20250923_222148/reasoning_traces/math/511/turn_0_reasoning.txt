=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending a total of $100.

1. **Calculate Gerald's earnings for the week:**
   - Gerald earns $30 every day.
   - A week consists of 7 days.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the week can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Number of Days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much he has left after spending:**
   - Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week.
   - To find out how much he has left, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings:
     \[
     \text{Amount Left} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Spending}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount Left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - After working for a week and spending $100, Gerald has $110 left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{110}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending $100. We'll break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate Gerald's Total Earnings for the Week:**

   Gerald earns $30 every day. We need to find out how much he earns in a week. Typically, a week consists of 7 days. However, since the problem states he worked for an entire week, we assume he worked 5 days (a standard workweek).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much Gerald earned in a week
   * He earns $30 per day
   * A week has 7 days
   * Weekly earnings = $30 × 7 days
   * Weekly earnings = $210

2. Next, let's subtract his spending
   * Gerald spent $100 in total
   * Money left = Weekly earnings - Spending
   * Money left = $210 - $100
   * Money left = $110

Reasoning:
* To find how much money Gerald has left, I first needed to calcula...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Gerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. If he worked for an entire week (7 days), we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his daily wage by the number of days he worked.

$30/day * 7 days = $210

So, Gerald earned $210 for the week.

Next, we know that Gerald spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the total amount he earned.

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left after working f...

Given information:
- Gerald earns $30 per day at the daycare.
- He worked for an entire week.
- He spent a total of $100.

Step 1: Determine how many days are in a week.
There are 7 days in a week.

Step 2: Calculate Gerald's total earnings for the week.
Earnings per day = $30
Number of days worked = 7
Total earnings = Earnings per day × Number of days worked
Total earnings = $30 × 7 = $210
