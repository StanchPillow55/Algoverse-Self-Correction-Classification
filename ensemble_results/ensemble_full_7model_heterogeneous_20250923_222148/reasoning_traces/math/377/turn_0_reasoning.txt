Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday**:
   Lucy sells apples for $4 each. She made $56 from selling the apples on Monday. To find out how many apples she sold, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Price per apple}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

   So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

2. **Determine the number of apples picked on Tuesday**:
   On Tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

3. **Determine the number of apples picked on Wednesday**:
   On Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Therefore, the number of apples picked on Wednesday is:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Number of apples picked on Tuesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days**:
   Now, we will add the number of apples picked on each day:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
   \]

   Since Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday, we can consider the apples picked on Monday as the apples sold, which is 14. Therefore:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 = 26
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 26 + 24 = 50
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is:

   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
