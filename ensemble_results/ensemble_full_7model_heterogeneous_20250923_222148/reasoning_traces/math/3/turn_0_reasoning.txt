=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many total meters James runs in a week, we can break the problem down into smaller steps.

1. **Determine the distance James runs in one sprint:**
   James runs 60 meters in each sprint.

2. **Calculate the total distance for one day of sprints:**
   James runs 3 sprints each time he runs. Therefore, the total distance he runs in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = \text{Distance per sprint} \times \text{Number of sprints}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance per day} = 60 \text{ meters/sprint} \times 3 \text{ sprints} = 180 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for a week:**
   James runs 3 times a week. Thus, the total distance he runs in a week is:
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = \text{Distance per day} \times \text{Number of days per week}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total distance per week} = 180 \text{ meters/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 540 \text{ meters}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total distance James runs in a week is:
   \[
   \boxed{540} \text{ meters}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of meters James runs in a week.

Given information:
- James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week.
- Each sprint is 60 meters.

Step 1: Find the total number of meters James runs per sprint.
Meters per sprint = 60 meters

Step 2: Find the total number of meters James runs per session (3 sprints).
Meters per session = 3 sprints × 60 meters per sprint = 180 meters

Step 3: Find the total number of meters J...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the total distance James runs in a week based on the information given.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - James runs 3 sprints each time he runs.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters long.
   - He runs 3 times a week.

2. **Calculate the Distance per Session:**
   - Each session consists of 3 sprints.
   - Each sprint is 60 meters.
   - Therefore, the distance James runs in one session is calculated by multiplying the number of spri...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* James runs 3 sprints each time
* He does this 3 times per week
* Each sprint is 60 meters

2. To find total meters per week:
* First calculate meters per session:
  * Meters per session = 3 sprints × 60 meters
  * Meters per session = 180 meters

3. Then calculate total meters for the week:
* Weekly meters = Meters per session × Sessions per week
* Weekly meters ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many meters James runs in a day. Since he runs 3 sprints and each sprint is 60 meters, we multiply the number of sprints by the distance of each sprint.

3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters

So, James runs 180 meters in a day.

Next, we need to find out how many meters he runs in a week. Since he runs 3 times a week, we multiply the distance he runs in a day by the number of days he runs.

180 meters/day * 3 days/week = 540 meters/week...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James runs 3 sprints, 3 times a week.
   * Each sprint is 60 meters.

2. Calculate the total number of sprints James runs in a week:
   * Sprints per session = 3
   * Sessions per week = 3
   * Total sprints per week = Sprints per session × Sessions per week
   * Total sprints per week = 3 × 3 = 9 sprints

3. Calculate the total distance James runs in a week:
   * Dist...
