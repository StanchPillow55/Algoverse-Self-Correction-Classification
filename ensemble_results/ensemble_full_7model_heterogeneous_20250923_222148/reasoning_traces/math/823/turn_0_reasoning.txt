=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the points scored by Sasha and Julie in both games.

**Step 1: Calculate Julie's score in the first game.**

We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's score in the first game} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Sasha's score in the second game.**

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated that Julie scored 10 points in the first game. Thus, we can find Sasha's score in the second game:

\[
\text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total points scored by Sasha.**

Now, we will add the points Sasha scored in both games:

\[
\text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 14 + 4 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**

Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.
- In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.
- In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.

Step 1: Calculate Julie's score in the first game.
Sasha's score in the first game - 4 = Julie's score in the first game
14 - 4 = 10 points

Step 2: Calculate Sasha's score in the second gam...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of points Sasha scored in both games and then add them together to find the total.

**Step 1: Determine Sasha's score in the first game.**

We are given that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.

\[ \text{Sasha's score in Game 1} = 14 \]

**Step 2: Determine Julie's score in the first game.**

Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. Therefore, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score to find Julie's sc...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First game:
* Sasha scored 14 points
* Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha
* So Julie's score = Sasha's score - 4
* Julie's score = 14 - 4 = 10 points

2. Second game:
* Julie scored 10 points in first game
* Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's first game score
* So Sasha's second game score = Julie's first game score - 6
* Sasha's second game score = 10 - 6 = 4 points

3. Total points Sasha scored:
* Tot...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since we know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score of 14 points. 

14 - 4 = 10 points

So, Julie scored 10 points in the first game. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. So we subtract 6 from Julie's score of 10 points.

10 - 6 = 4 points

So, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.
