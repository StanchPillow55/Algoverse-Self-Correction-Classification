=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps**: 
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.

2. **Determine how many letters Jennie stamps**:
   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. 
   To find out how many letters that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of letters still needing stamps**:
   After stamping 20 letters, the number of letters still needing stamps is:
   \[
   \text{Letters still needing stamps} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Identify the total number of already-stamped letters after Jennie stamps**:
   We know that after Jennie stamps the letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

5. **Determine the initial number of already-stamped letters**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of letters that were already stamped before Jennie started. After Jennie stamps 20 letters, the total number of already-stamped letters becomes:
   \[
   x + 20
   \]
   We know this total equals 30:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of letters that were in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \( \boxed{10} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
- Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
- After Jennie stamps one-third of the letters, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

Step 1: Calculate how many letters Jennie stamped.
One-third of 60 letters = 60 รท 3 = 20 letters

Step 2: Calculate the number of letters in the already-stamped pil...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started putting stamps on the unstamped letters.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the number of letters needing stamps initially:**
   - Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.

2. **Determine how many letters Jennie stamps:**
   - Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   - One-third of 60 lett...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify the key information:
* Started with 60 letters needing stamps
* Jennie stamped one-third of these letters
* After Jennie stamped letters, there are 30 letters in the stamped pile
* We need to find how many stamped letters were there originally

2. Calculate how many letters Jennie stamped:
* One-third of 60 letters = 60 รท 3 = 20 letters stamped by Jennie

3. We know that after Jennie added her stam...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she stamped one-third of the 60 letters, we calculate 60 divided by 3, which equals 20 letters.

Now we know that Jennie stamped 20 letters. Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to find out how many were in that pile when Jennie began. 

We do this by subtracting the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of letters in the pile now. So, we calculate ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps.
   * She also has a pile of letters already stamped.
   * Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps.
   * After stamping, there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters.

2. Calculate the number of letters Jennie stamped:
   * One-third of the letters needing stamps = 1/3 ร 60
