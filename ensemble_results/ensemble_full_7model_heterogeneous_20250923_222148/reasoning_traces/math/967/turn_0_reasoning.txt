=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then calculate the total age of all three family members.

1. **Determine Nani's Age:**
   - Nani is given to be 8 years old.

2. **Calculate Nani's Brother's Age:**
   - It is stated that Nani's brother is twice his age.
   - Therefore, the brother's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Brother's Age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's Age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate Nani's Sister's Age:**
   - Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we first need to calculate 25% of Nani's age:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Since she is 25% younger, we subtract this amount from Nani's age:
     \[
     \text{Sister's Age} = \text{Nani's Age} - 25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Age of All Three Family Members:**
   - Now we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = \text{Nani's Age} + \text{Brother's Age} + \text{Sister's Age}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 8 + 16 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 30 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is \( \boxed{30} \) years.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then calculate the total age of all three family members.

1. **Determine Nani's Age:**
   - Nani is given to be 8 years old.

2. **Calculate Nani's Brother's Age:**
   - It is stated that Nani's brother is twice his age.
   - Therefore, the brother's age can be calculated as:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Nani is 8 years old.
- Nani's brother is twice his age.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than him.

Step 1: Find the age of Nani's brother.
Nani's brother's age = 2 × Nani's age
Nani's brother's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Nani's sister.
Nani's sister's age = Nani's age - (25% of Nani's age)
Nani's sister's age = 8 - (0.25 × 8) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old

Step 3: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then sum these ages to find the total age of all three family members.

1. **Nani's Age:**
   - Nani is given to be 8 years old.

2. **Nani's Brother's Age:**
   - It is stated that Nani's brother is twice Nani's age.
   - Since Nani is 8 years old, his brother's age is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's Age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's Age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify Nani's age:
* Nani is 8 years old

2. Calculate his brother's age:
* Brother is twice Nani's age
* Brother's age = 8 × 2 = 16 years old

3. Calculate his sister's age:
* Sister is 25% younger than Nani
* 25% of 8 = (8 × 0.25) = 2 years younger
* Sister's age = 8 - 2 = 6 years old

4. Calculate total age of all three:
* Total = Nani's age + Brother's age + Sister's age
* Total = 8 + 16 + 6 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani's brother is twice his age, we multiply Nani's age by 2.

8 years * 2 = 16 years

So, Nani's brother is 16 years old.

Next, let's find out the age of Nani's sister. Since Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, we need to find out what 25% of Nani's age is and then subtract that from Nani's age.

25% of 8 years = 0.25 * 8 years = 2 years

So, Nani's sister is 8 years - 2 years = 6 years old.

Finally, to find the...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the ages of Nani's brother and sister, and then add all three ages together to get the total age of all three family members.

Given:
- Nani is 8 years old.
- Nani's brother is twice his age.
- Nani's sister is 25% younger than him.

Step 1: Calculate Nani's brother's age.
Nani's brother's age = 2 × Nani's age
Nani's brother's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years old

Step 2: Calculate Nani's sister's age....
