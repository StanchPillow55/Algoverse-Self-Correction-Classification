=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan for the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total minutes used for daily calls to his boss**:
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - There are 30 days in the month.
   - Total minutes used for calls to his boss = 15 minutes/day × 30 days = 450 minutes.

2. **Add the extra minutes used**:
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss + Extra minutes = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

3. **Determine the total minutes available in his plan**:
   - Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month.

4. **Calculate the remaining minutes**:
   - Remaining minutes = Total minutes in plan - Total minutes used = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Thus, after calculating all the minutes used and subtracting from his total plan, we find that Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.

**Final Answer**: Jason has 250 minutes left.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jason has a total of 1000 minutes per month.

He has a 15-minute call with his boss every day. Over 30 days, this amounts to 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

In addition to this, he has had 300 extra minutes of call this month to other people.

So, the total minutes he has used this month is 450 minutes (to his boss) + 300 minutes (to other people) = 750 minutes.

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is 1000 minutes (total) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 mi...
