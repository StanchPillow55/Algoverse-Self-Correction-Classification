=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total calories in John's 6 egg omelet with cheese and ham, we will calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the calories from the eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
   \[
   \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \text{ eggs} \times 75 \text{ calories/egg} = 450 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate the calories from the cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = Number of ounces × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from cheese} = 2 \text{ oz} \times 120 \text{ calories/oz} = 240 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the calories from the ham:**
   - John uses 2 oz of ham (equal amount to cheese).
   - Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = Number of ounces × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from ham} = 2 \text{ oz} \times 40 \text{ calories/oz} = 80 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Sum the total calories from all ingredients:**
   - Total calories in the omelet = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 \text{ calories} + 240 \text{ calories} + 80 \text{ calories}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \text{ calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**. 

Final answer: **770 calories**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- John makes a 6 egg omelet
- The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese
- The omelet contains an equal amount of ham as cheese (2 oz)
- Eggs are 75 calories each
- Cheese is 120 calories per ounce
- Ham is 40 calories per ounce

Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
Calories from eggs = 6 eggs × 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese.
Calories from cheese...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
John uses 6 eggs in his omelet. Each egg contains 75 calories. Therefore, the total calories from the eggs can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Calories from eggs} = 6 \, \text{eggs} \times 75 \, \text{calories/egg} = 450 \, \text{calories}
\]

### Step 2: Calcul...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Calculate calories from eggs:
* 6 eggs × 75 calories per egg
* 6 × 75 = 450 calories from eggs

2. Calculate calories from cheese:
* 2 oz of cheese × 120 calories per oz
* 2 × 120 = 240 calories from cheese

3. Calculate calories from ham:
* Problem states "equal amount of ham" as cheese, so 2 oz of ham
* 2 oz of ham × 40 calories per oz
* 2 × 40 = 80 calories from ham

4. Add all calories together:
* Total calor...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total calories from each ingredient:

1. Eggs: John uses 6 eggs for his omelet. Given that each egg is 75 calories, the total calories from the eggs would be 6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories.

2. Cheese: John uses 2 oz of cheese. Given that each ounce of cheese is 120 calories, the total calories from the cheese would be 2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories.

3. Ham: John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Given that e...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John's omelet contains 6 eggs, 2 oz of cheese, and an equal amount of ham as cheese.
   * Each egg is 75 calories.
   * Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
   * Ham is 40 calories per ounce.

2. Calculate the calories from the eggs:
   * Calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
