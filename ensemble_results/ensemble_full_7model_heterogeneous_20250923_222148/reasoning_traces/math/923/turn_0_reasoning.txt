=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Total Cups**: Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea.

2. **Dividing the Cups into Rows**: She divides these 27 cups into 3 rows. This means that each row will have:
   \[
   \text{Cups per row} = \frac{27 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

3. **Cups of Cinnamon Tea**: We know that Lana uses some of the cups to brew cinnamon tea. She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. 

4. **Calculating Remaining Cups for Chamomile and Mint Tea**: To find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea, we subtract the cups used for cinnamon tea from the total cups:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cups} = 27 \text{ cups} - 15 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Dividing Remaining Cups into Chamomile and Mint Tea**: The remaining 12 cups are divided equally into chamomile and mint tea. Since there are 2 types of tea (chamomile and mint), we divide the remaining cups by 2:
   \[
   \text{Cups of chamomile tea} = \text{Cups of mint tea} = \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2} = 6 \text{ cups}
   \]

6. **Cups of Mint Tea in Each Row**: Since each row has an equal amount of chamomile and mint tea, and we have determined that there are 6 cups of mint tea in total, we need to find out how many cups of mint tea are in each row. Since there are 3 rows:
   \[
   \text{Cups of mint tea per row} = \frac{6 \text{ cups}}{3 \text{ rows}} = 2 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **2 cups of mint tea in each row**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lana has 27 cups in total.
- She divides the cups into 3 rows.
- In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.
- The remaining cups are used to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Step 1: Determine the number of cups in each row.
Total cups / Number of rows = Cups in each row
27 cups / 3 rows = 9 cups in each row

Step 2: Determine the number of cups...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of mint tea are in each row when Lana divides 27 cups into 3 rows, with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row, and uses the remaining cups to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Cups and Rows:**
   - Lana has a total of 27 cups.
   - She divides these cups into 3 rows.

2. **Cups Used for Cinnamon Tea:**
   - Lana uses some of these cups to brew 15 cu...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify the key information:
   * Total cups = 27
   * Divided into 3 rows
   * Each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea
   * 15 cups are cinnamon tea
   * Need to find mint tea cups per row

2) Let's find how many cups are NOT cinnamon tea:
   * Total cups - Cinnamon tea cups = Non-cinnamon cups
   * 27 - 15 = 12 cups are either chamomile or mint

3) These 12 cups are divided into 3 row...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cups of tea Lana used for chamomile and mint tea. We know she made 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so we subtract this from the total number of cups she had.

27 cups (total) - 15 cups (cinnamon tea) = 12 cups (chamomile and mint tea)

Since Lana divided these 12 cups into 3 rows, we divide 12 by 3 to find out how many cups are in each row.

12 cups รท 3 rows = 4 cups per row

Since each row contains equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, we ...
