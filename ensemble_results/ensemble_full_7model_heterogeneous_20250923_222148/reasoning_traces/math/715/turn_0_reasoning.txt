=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original planned price per computer.**
   The company planned to buy 500 computers at a price of $700 each.

   \[
   \text{Original price per computer} = 700 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the increase in price due to the 10% increase.**
   The price of each computer increased by 10%. To find the new price, we first calculate 10% of the original price.

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the new price per computer.**
   Now, we add the increase to the original price to find the new price.

   \[
   \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.**
   To find the total cost, we multiply the new price per computer by the number of computers.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{New price per computer} \times \text{Number of computers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 770 \times 500
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   770 \times 500 = 385000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   The total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

   \[
   \boxed{385000} \text{ dollars}
   \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The company had planned to spend $700 for each computer. However, the price of each computer increased by 10%. 

To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price. 

10% of $700 is calculated as follows:

10/100 * $700 = $70

So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770

The company wanted to buy 500 computers. Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is calcula...
