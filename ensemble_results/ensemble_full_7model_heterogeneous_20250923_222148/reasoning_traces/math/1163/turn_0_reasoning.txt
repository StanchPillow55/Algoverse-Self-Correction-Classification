=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many face masks Tyrion uses in a given period based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of times Tyrion goes out in a day**: 
   - Tyrion goes out **3 times a day**.

2. **Determine how many face masks he uses each time he goes out**: 
   - Tyrion changes his face mask **2 times** every time he goes out.

3. **Calculate the total number of face masks used in one day**:
   - Since he goes out 3 times and changes his mask 2 times each time, we can calculate the total masks used in one day as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total masks per day} = \text{Number of outings} \times \text{Masks per outing} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ masks}
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of face masks used over 2 days**:
   - Now, we need to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days. We can multiply the number of masks used in one day by 2:
   \[
   \text{Total masks in 2 days} = \text{Total masks per day} \times 2 = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ masks}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days is **12 masks**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of face masks Tyrion uses every 2 days.

Given information:
- Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
- Tyrion goes out three times a day.

Step 1: Find the number of face masks Tyrion uses per day.
Number of face masks used per day = Number of times Tyrion goes out per day × Number of times he changes his face mask per outing
Number of face masks used per day = 3 × 2 = 6 face ma...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many face masks Tyrion uses in a given period based on his habits.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.
   - He goes out three times a day.
   - We need to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days.

2. **Calculate the Number of Face Masks Used in One Outing:**
   - Since Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Tyrion uses 2 masks each time he goes out
* He goes out 3 times per day
* We need to find the total masks for 2 days

2. Let's calculate masks used per day:
* Masks per outing = 2
* Number of outings per day = 3
* Masks per day = 2 masks × 3 outings
* Masks per day = 6 masks

3. Now calculate masks used in 2 days:
* Masks for 2 days = Masks per day × 2 days
* Masks for...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. This means that every time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks. 

If he goes out three times a day, we multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of masks he uses each time. 

2 masks * 3 times = 6 masks

So, Tyrion uses 6 masks every day.

If we want to find out how many masks he uses in 2 days, we multiply the number of masks he uses in a day by 2.

6 masks * 2 days = 12 masks

So, Tyrion uses 12 f...
