=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine what percent of Candy's spools of thread are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of spools of thread.**
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   We can calculate the total number of spools by adding these quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue} + \text{Light green} + \text{Dark green}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add light blue and dark blue:
     \[
     15 + 45 = 60
     \]

   - Next, add light green:
     \[
     60 + 40 = 100
     \]

   - Finally, add dark green:
     \[
     100 + 50 = 150
     \]

   So, the total number of spools is \(150\).

2. **Identify the total number of blue spools.**
   - Blue spools consist of both light blue and dark blue spools:
   \[
   \text{Total blue spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total blue spools} = 15 + 45
   \]

   Performing the addition:
   \[
   15 + 45 = 60
   \]

   So, the total number of blue spools is \(60\).

3. **Calculate the percentage of spools that are blue.**
   To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Plugging in the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
   \]

   Now, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{60}{150} = 0.4
   \]

   Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.4 \times 100 = 40
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is \( \boxed{40} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of spools Candy has and then calculate the percentage of blue spools.

Given information:
- Candy has 15 light blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 45 dark blue spools of thread.
- Candy has 40 light green spools of thread.
- Candy has 50 dark green spools of thread.

Step 1: Find the total number of spools Candy has.
Total number of spools = Light blue spools + Dark blue spools + Light green spool...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine what percent of Candy's spools are blue, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Spools:**

   Candy has four types of spools:
   - Light blue spools: 15
   - Dark blue spools: 45
   - Light green spools: 40
   - Dark green spools: 50

   First, we find the total number of spools by adding all these together:

   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total spools} = 150
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify all the blue spools:
   * Light blue spools = 15
   * Dark blue spools = 45
   * Total blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools

2. Now let's find the total number of spools:
   * Light blue spools = 15
   * Dark blue spools = 45
   * Light green spools = 40
   * Dark green spools = 50
   * Total spools = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools

3. To find the percentage of blue spools:
   * Percentage...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total number of spools Candy has. We do this by adding up all the different types of spools she has:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green = 150 total spools

Next, we need to find out how many of these spools are blue. We do this by adding up the light blue and dark blue spools:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools

Now we can find out what percent of her spools are blue. We do this by dividing the number ...
