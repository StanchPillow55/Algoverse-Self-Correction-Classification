Final Answer: To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Jame's current age**:
   Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. Therefore, we can find his current age by subtracting 5 from 27:
   \[
   \text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22
   \]

2. **Determine Jame's age in 8 years**:
   In 8 years, Jame's age will be:
   \[
   \text{Jame's age in 8 years} = 22 + 8 = 30
   \]

3. **Determine his cousin's age in 8 years**:
   According to the problem, in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time. We already calculated that Jame will be 30 years old in 8 years. Therefore, twice Jame's age will be:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   Now, his cousin will be 5 years younger than this amount:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's age in 8 years} = 60 - 5 = 55
   \]

4. **Determine the cousin's current age**:
   Since we know the cousin will be 55 years old in 8 years, we can find the cousin's current age by subtracting 8 from 55:
   \[
   \text{Cousin's current age} = 55 - 8 = 47
   \]

5. **Calculate the age difference between Jame and his cousin**:
   Now we can find the difference in their current ages:
   \[
   \text{Age difference} = \text{Cousin's current age} - \text{Jame's current age} = 47 - 22 = 25
   \]

Thus, the number of years that separate the age of Jame and his cousin now is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then calculate the difference between their ages.

Given information:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.

Step 1: Find Jame's current age.
Jame's age in 5 years = 27
Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

Step 2: Find the cousin's age in 8 years.
Cousin's age in 8 years = 2 × Jame's age in 8 years -...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Jame and his cousin, and then find the difference between their ages.

**Step 1: Determine Jame's current age.**

We know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. To find his current age, we subtract 5 years from 27:

\[ 
27 - 5 = 22 
\]

So, Jame is currently 22 years old.

**Step 2: Determine the cousin's age in terms of Jame's age.**

The problem states that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger tha...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Jame's current age
   * Jame will be 27 in 5 years
   * So his current age = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

2. Let's find Jame's age in 8 years
   * Jame's age in 8 years = Current age + 8
   * = 22 + 8 = 30 years old

3. Now we can find his cousin's age in 8 years using the given information
   * Cousin's age in 8 years = (2 × Jame's age in 8 years) - 5
   * = (2 × 30) - 5
   * = 60 - 5
   * = 55 years...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Jame's current age as J. According to the problem, Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years, so we can write:

J + 5 = 27

Solving this equation for J, we get:

J = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

Now, let's denote Jame's cousin's current age as C. The problem states that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. We can write this as:

C + 8 = 2*(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into this equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2*(22 + 8) - 5

Solving thi...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up equations and solve for the unknown values.

Given:
- Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.
- In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age.

Step 1: Let's find Jame's current age.
Jame's age in 5 years = 27
Jame's current age = 27 - 5 = 22

Step 2: Express Jame's age in 8 years.
Jame's age in 8 years = Current age + 8
Jame's age in 8 years = 22 + 8...
