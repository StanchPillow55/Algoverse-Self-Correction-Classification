=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Marisa's daily expenses on lollipops:**
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the lollipops each day is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of lollipops} = 4 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
     \]

2. **Calculate Marisa's daily savings:**
   - Marisa receives $5 as pocket money each day.
   - After buying the lollipops, the amount of money she has left (savings) is:
     \[
     \text{Daily savings} = \text{Daily pocket money} - \text{Cost of lollipops} = 5.00 \text{ dollars} - 1.00 \text{ dollar} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate total savings over 5 days:**
   - Since Marisa saves $4.00 each day, over 5 days, her total savings will be:
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times \text{Number of days} = 4.00 \text{ dollars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{20.00} \text{ dollars}
     \]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day after buying lollipops and then calculate the total savings over 5 days.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the daily cost of lollipops:**
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the lollipops each day is:
     \[
     4 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.25 \text{ dollars per lollipop} = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Marisa gets $5 per day
* She buys 4 lollipops each day
* Each lollipop costs $0.25 (25 cents)
* She saves for 5 days

2. Calculate how much she spends on lollipops per day:
* Cost per day = 4 lollipops × $0.25
* Cost per day = $1.00

3. Calculate how much she saves per day:
* Daily savings = Money received - Money spent
* Daily savings = $5.00 - $1.00
* Daily savings = $4.00

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Marisa gets $5 every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the cost of 4 lollipops is 4 * 25 cents = 100 cents = $1.

So, every day, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops. 

Since she gets $5 every day, the amount she saves every day is $5 - $1 = $4.

If she saves for 5 days, the total amount she saves is 5 * $4 = $20.

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day.
   * She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day.
   * She saves the change in her piggy bank.
   * We need to find out how much money she saves in 5 days.

2. Calculate the total cost of lollipops per day:
   * Cost of one lollipop = 25 cents
   * Number of lollipops bought per day = 4
   * Total cost of lollipops pe...
