=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the length of Movie A in minutes. We will start by determining the lengths of Movies B and C based on the information provided.

1. **Convert Movie C's length to minutes**:
   Movie C is given as 1.25 hours. To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
   \[
   \text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the length of Movie B**:
   We know from the problem that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. Therefore, we can calculate the length of Movie B as follows:
   \[
   \text{Length of Movie B} = \text{Length of Movie C} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 80 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of Movie A**:
   According to the problem, Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. We can find the length of Movie A by dividing the length of Movie B by 4:
   \[
   \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{\text{Length of Movie B}}{4} = \frac{80 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the lengths of all the movies, we can summarize our findings:

- Length of Movie C: 75 minutes
- Length of Movie B: 80 minutes
- Length of Movie A: 20 minutes

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20} \text{ minutes}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.
- Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
- Movie C was 1.25 hours.

Step 1: Convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes.
Movie C was 1.25 hours.
1.25 hours = 1 hour and 15 minutes = 75 minutes.

Step 2: Find the length of Movie B.
Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.
Length of Movie B = Length of Movie C + 5 minutes
Length of...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of Movie A in minutes, given the relationships between the lengths of Movies A, B, and C.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the length of Movie C in minutes:**
   - We are given that Movie C is 1.25 hours long.
   - To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
   \[
   1.25 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 75 \text{ minutes}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Movie C's length in minutes
* Movie C is 1.25 hours
* To convert hours to minutes: 1.25 ร 60 = 75 minutes
* So Movie C = 75 minutes

2. Now find Movie B's length
* Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C
* Movie B = Movie C + 5
* Movie B = 75 + 5 = 80 minutes

3. Finally, find Movie A's length
* Movie A is one-fourth of Movie B
* Movie A = Movie B รท 4
* Movie A = 80 รท 4 = 20 minutes

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes because the length of Movie B is given in minutes and we are asked to find the length of Movie A in minutes. 

There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so Movie C, which is 1.25 hours long, is 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes long.

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, Movie A is 2...
