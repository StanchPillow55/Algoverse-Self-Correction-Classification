=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first define the points scored by each student based on the information provided.

1. **Points scored by Naomi**: We know that Naomi scored 68 points.

2. **Points scored by Yuri**: The problem states that Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Naomi's score} + 10
   \]
   Substituting Naomi's score:
   \[
   \text{Yuri's score} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
   \]

3. **Points scored by Brianna**: The problem states that Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = \text{Naomi's score} + 17
   \]
   Substituting Naomi's score:
   \[
   \text{Brianna's score} = 68 + 17 = 85
   \]

4. **Total points scored by all students**: We know the total points scored by all four students is 251. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Naomi's score} + \text{Yuri's score} + \text{Brianna's score} + \text{Jojo's score}
   \]
   Substituting the known scores:
   \[
   251 = 68 + 44 + 85 + \text{Jojo's score}
   \]

5. **Calculating Jojo's score**: First, we will calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:
   \[
   68 + 44 + 85 = 197
   \]
   Now we can substitute this back into the total points equation:
   \[
   251 = 197 + \text{Jojo's score}
   \]
   To find Jojo's score, we subtract 197 from 251:
   \[
   \text{Jojo's score} = 251 - 197 = 54
   \]

Thus, Jojo scored **54 points**.

Final answer: Jojo scored 54 points.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the points scored by each student and then calculate the points scored by Jojo.

Given information:
- The total points scored by the four students is 251.
- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

Step 1: Calculate the points scored by Yuri.
Yuri's points = (Naomi's points / 2) + 10
Yuri's points = (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 p...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total points = 251
* Naomi's points = 68
* Yuri's points = 10 more than half of Naomi's points
* Brianna's points = 17 more than Naomi's points
* Need to find Jojo's points

2. Let's calculate Yuri's points:
* Half of Naomi's points = 68 รท 2 = 34
* Yuri's points = 34 + 10 = 44 points

3. Let's calculate Brianna's points:
* Brianna's points = Naomi's points + 17
* Brianna's po...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34 points. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, we know that the total score of the four students is 251 points. So, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total score....
