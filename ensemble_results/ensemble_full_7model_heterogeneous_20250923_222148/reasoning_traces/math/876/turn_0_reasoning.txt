=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many points Amy scores on her history test, we need to calculate the points she earns from each type of question: multiple-choice, true/false, and long-answer questions. 

### Step 1: Calculate points from multiple-choice questions

- **Total multiple-choice questions:** 10
- **Percentage answered correctly:** 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (multiple-choice)} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
\]
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, the total points from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Points from multiple-choice} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate points from true/false questions

- **Total true/false questions:** 20
- **Percentage answered correctly:** 90%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (true/false)} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
\]
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, the total points from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Points from true/false} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate points from long-answer questions

- **Total long-answer questions:** 5
- **Percentage answered correctly:** 60%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers (long-answer)} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
\]
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, the total points from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Points from long-answer} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total points scored

Now we add up all the points from each type of question:
\[
\text{Total points} = \text{Points from multiple-choice} + \text{Points from true/false} + \text{Points from long-answer}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total points} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41
\]

### Final Answer
Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's first identify how many questions of each type Amy got correct:

* Multiple choice (80% of 10 questions):
  * 0.80 × 10 = 8 questions correct

* True/False (90% of 20 questions):
  * 0.90 × 20 = 18 questions correct

* Long answer (60% of 5 questions):
  * 0.60 × 5 = 3 questions correct

2. Now let's calculate points for each section:

* Multiple choice points:
  * Each question = 1 point
  * 8 correct × 1 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many questions Amy answered correctly in each category.

For the multiple-choice questions, she answered 80% of 10 questions correctly. To find this, we multiply 10 by 0.80 (which is the decimal equivalent of 80%). 

10 * 0.80 = 8 questions

For the true/false questions, she answered 90% of 20 questions correctly. We multiply 20 by 0.90 to find this.

20 * 0.90 = 18 questions

For the long-answer questions, she answered 60% of 5 questions correc...
