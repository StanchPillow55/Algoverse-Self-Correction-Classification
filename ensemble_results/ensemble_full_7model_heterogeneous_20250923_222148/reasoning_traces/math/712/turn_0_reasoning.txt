=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much candy Ginger and Amy each have after two weeks, and then find out how much more candy Amy has compared to Ginger.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of days in two weeks.**
Two weeks consist of:
\[
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate how much candy Ginger eats in two weeks.**
Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, over 14 days, she eats:
\[
4 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 56 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much candy Amy eats in two weeks.**
Amy eats 3 pieces of candy per day. Therefore, over 14 days, she eats:
\[
3 \text{ pieces/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate how much candy Ginger has left after two weeks.**
Ginger starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 56 pieces, she has:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 56 \text{ pieces} = 44 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how much candy Amy has left after two weeks.**
Amy starts with 100 pieces of candy. After eating 42 pieces, she has:
\[
100 \text{ pieces} - 42 \text{ pieces} = 58 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Step 6: Determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger.**
To find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract the amount of candy Ginger has from the amount Amy has:
\[
58 \text{ pieces} - 44 \text{ pieces} = 14 \text{ pieces}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy eat in two weeks.

There are 7 days in a week, so two weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks, she eats 4 * 14 = <<4*14=56>>56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so in two weeks, she eats 3 * 14 = <<3*14=42>>42 pieces of candy.

Now, let's calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy have left after two weeks.

Ginger started with 100 pieces of candy and ate 56 pieces,...

Given information:
- Ginger and Amy both start with 100 pieces of Halloween candy.
- Ginger eats 4 pieces a day.
- Amy eats 3 pieces a day.
- We need to find out how much more candy Amy has after two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days in two weeks.
2 weeks = 2 × 7 days = 14 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces Ginger eats in two weeks.
Ginger's consumption = 4 pieces per day × 14 days
