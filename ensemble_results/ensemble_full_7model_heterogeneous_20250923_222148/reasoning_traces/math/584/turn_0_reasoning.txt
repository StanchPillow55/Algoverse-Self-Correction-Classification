=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of the boxes after the discount.**
2. **Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.**
3. **Find the cost per contact.**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes after the discount

The original price of one box is $100.00. Since there is a 10% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount:

\[
\text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.10 \times 100 = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one box:

\[
\text{Sale Price of One Box} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 2 boxes:

\[
\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts. Therefore, the total number of contacts in 2 boxes is:

\[
\text{Total Contacts} = 2 \times 90 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per contact

Now, we need to find the cost per contact by dividing the total cost of the 2 boxes by the total number of contacts:

\[
\text{Cost per Contact} = \frac{\text{Total Cost for 2 Boxes}}{\text{Total Contacts}} = \frac{180}{180} = 1
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the cost for each pair of contacts is:

\[
\text{Cost per Contact} = 1
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]

2. **Calculate the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.**
3. **Find the cost per contact.**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes after the discount

The original price of one box is $100.00. Since there is a 10% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount:

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of each pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes of contacts.

Given information:
- 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box and will last Pete 45 days.
- Each box costs $100.00 and is currently 10% off.
- Pete wants to buy 2 boxes of contacts.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box of contacts after the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per pair of contacts when Pete buys 2 boxes, considering the discount.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Contacts

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts. If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total number of contacts he will have is:

\[ 
90 \text{ contacts/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 180 \text{ contacts} 
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Discounted Price per Box

The original price of each box is $100.00. There is a 10...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many pairs of contacts are in 2 boxes:
   * 90 contacts = 45 pairs per box (since we need 2 contacts per pair)
   * 2 boxes = 45 pairs × 2 = 90 total pairs

2. Calculate the cost for 2 boxes with 10% discount:
   * Original price per box = $100.00
   * 10% discount = $100.00 × 0.10 = $10.00 off per box
   * Discounted price per box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00
   * Cost for 2 boxes = $90....

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many pairs of contacts are in one box. Since Pete uses 2 contacts per day (one for each eye), and one box lasts him 45 days, there are 45 pairs of contacts in one box.

Next, let's find out the cost of one box with the discount. 10% off of $100.00 is $10.00, so one box costs $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 * $90.00 = $180.00.

Finally, let's find out the cost of each pair of contacts. Since there are 45 ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * 1 box contains 90 single use contacts
   * 1 box lasts Pete 45 days
   * Each box costs $100.00
   * There is a current 10% discount on the boxes
   * Pete is buying 2 boxes

2. Calculate the discounted price of each box:
   * Discount amount = 10% of $100.00
   * Discount amount = 0.1 × $100.00 = $10.00
   * Discounted price per box = Original price - Discount amount
