=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip**:
   The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty card rules, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent. 

   \[
   \text{Rewards earned} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   So, the customer has $4 in rewards.

2. **Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip**:
   The customer spent $43 on this shopping trip.

3. **Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip**:
   The customer has $4 in rewards, which they can use to reduce the cost of their current shopping trip. 

   \[
   \text{Price after applying rewards} = \text{Current amount spent} - \text{Rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Apply the coupon**:
   The coupon takes off twice the amount of rewards. Since the customer has $4 in rewards, the coupon will take off:

   \[
   \text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the final amount paid**:
   Now we subtract the coupon discount from the price after applying the rewards:

   \[
   \text{Final amount paid} = \text{Price after applying rewards} - \text{Coupon discount} = 39 - 8 = 31 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the customer paid **$31** on this shopping trip.

Final answer: **$31**.
