Final Answer: To determine how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for in order to make a total of $135, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling eggplants:**
   Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each. The total revenue from the eggplants can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue from eggplants} = \text{Number of eggplants} \times \text{Price per eggplant}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = 60
   \]

   So, Bennet makes $60 from selling the eggplants.

2. **Determine the remaining amount needed to reach the total goal of $135:**
   Bennet wants to make a total of $135. We can find out how much more he needs to earn from selling corn by subtracting the revenue from eggplants from the total goal:

   \[
   \text{Remaining amount needed} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Total revenue from eggplants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount needed} = 135 - 60 = 75
   \]

   Bennet needs to earn $75 from selling corn.

3. **Calculate the price per ear of corn:**
   Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the remaining amount needed by the number of ears of corn:

   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount needed}}{\text{Number of ears of corn}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price per ear of corn} = \frac{75}{25} = 3
   \]

   Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.

4. **Final answer:**
   Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the price at which Bennet should sell each ear of corn to achieve his goal of making a total of $135.

First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants:

1. Bennet sells 20 eggplants at $3 each.
2. The total revenue from the eggplants is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Revenue from eggplants} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Next, we need to determine how much more money Bennet needs ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how much money Bennet makes from selling eggplants:
* Number of eggplants = 20
* Price per eggplant = $3
* Money from eggplants = 20 × $3 = $60

2. Now, we know:
* Bennet wants to make a total of $135
* He already makes $60 from eggplants
* So money needed from corn = $135 - $60 = $75

3. To find price per ear of corn:
* Number of ears of corn = 25
* Total money needed from corn = $75
* Price pe...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he makes 20 * $3 = $<<20*3=60>>60 from selling eggplants.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from selling eggplants, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $<<135-60=75>>75 more from selling his corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount of money he ne...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bennet sells 20 eggplants for $3 each.
   * He has 25 ears of corn to sell.
   * Bennet wants to make a total of $135.

2. Calculate the total amount Bennet will make from selling the eggplants:
   * Eggplant revenue = Number of eggplants × Price per eggplant
   * Eggplant revenue = 20 × $3
   * Eggplant revenue = $60

3. Calculate the remaining amount Bennet nee...
