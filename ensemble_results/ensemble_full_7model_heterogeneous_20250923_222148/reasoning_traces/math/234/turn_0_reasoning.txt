=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow in order to meet his daily consumption of tomatoes.

1. **Determine Steve's Daily Consumption:**
   - According to the problem, Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Determine Weekly Consumption:**
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate Steve's weekly consumption of tomatoes:
   \[
   \text{Weekly Consumption} = \text{Daily Consumption} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly Consumption} = 6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
   \]

3. **Determine Tomato Production per Vine:**
   - The problem states that each vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week.

4. **Calculate the Number of Vines Needed:**
   - To find out how many vines Steve needs to produce enough tomatoes for his weekly consumption, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of Vines} = \frac{\text{Weekly Consumption}}{\text{Tomatoes per Vine}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Vines} = \frac{42 \text{ tomatoes/week}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, Steve needs **14 vines** to produce enough cherry tomatoes for his weekly consumption.

In conclusion, Steve needs **14 vines** to meet his daily consumption of 6 cherry tomatoes.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day
* His girlfriend eats half as many as Steve (so 3 per day)
* Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week

2. Calculate total daily tomato consumption:
* Steve's daily consumption = 6 tomatoes
* Girlfriend's daily consumption = 3 tomatoes
* Total daily consumption = 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day

3. Calculate weekly tomato consumption:
* Weekly con...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat in total per week. 

Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, over a week (7 days), he eats 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week.

So, in total, they eat 42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

Given that a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week...
