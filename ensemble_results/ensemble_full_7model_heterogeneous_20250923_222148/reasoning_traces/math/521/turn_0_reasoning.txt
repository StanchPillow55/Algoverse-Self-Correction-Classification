=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will go through each day step by step, calculating how many math problems Chris completes and how many he has left.

1. **Total Problems**: Chris has a total of 100 math problems.

2. **Monday**: 
   - Problems completed on Monday = 12
   - Remaining problems after Monday = Total problems - Problems completed on Monday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Monday} = 100 - 12 = 88
   \]

3. **Tuesday**: 
   - Problems completed on Tuesday = 3 times the problems completed on Monday
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Tuesday} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Tuesday = Remaining problems after Monday - Problems completed on Tuesday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Tuesday} = 88 - 36 = 52
   \]

4. **Wednesday**: 
   - Problems completed on Wednesday = one-quarter of the remaining problems
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Wednesday} = \frac{1}{4} \times 52 = 13
   \]
   - Remaining problems after Wednesday = Remaining problems after Tuesday - Problems completed on Wednesday
   \[
   \text{Remaining problems after Wednesday} = 52 - 13 = 39
   \]

5. **Thursday**: 
   - The number of math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday is the remaining problems after Wednesday, which we calculated to be 39.

Thus, the final answer is that Chris has **39 math problems left to complete on Thursday**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Chris has a total of 100 math problems to complete.
- On Monday, he completes 12 problems.
- On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday.
- On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems.

Step 1: Calculate the number of problems Chris completed on Tuesday.
Problems completed on Tuesday = 3 × 12 = 36 problems

Step 2: Calculate the ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of math problems Chris completes each day and determine how many are left by Thursday.

1. **Total Problems:**
   Chris starts with 100 math problems.

2. **Problems Completed on Monday:**
   On Monday, Chris completes 12 problems.
   \[
   \text{Problems completed on Monday} = 12
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total problems = 100
* Monday's problems = 12
* Tuesday's problems = 3 × Monday's problems
* Wednesday's problems = 1/4 of remaining problems after Tuesday

2. Calculate Tuesday's problems:
* Tuesday = 3 × Monday
* Tuesday = 3 × 12 = 36 problems

3. Calculate problems completed after Monday and Tuesday:
* Problems done = Monday + Tuesday
* Problems done = 12 + 36 = 48 problem...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Chris starts with 100 math problems.

On Monday, he completes 12 problems. This leaves him with 100 - 12 = 88 problems.

On Tuesday, he completes 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday. This means he completes 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday.

After Tuesday, he has 88 - 36 = 52 problems left.

On Wednesday, he completes one-quarter of the remaining math problems. This means he completes 52 / 4 = 13 problems on Wednesday.

After Wednesday, he has 52 - 13 = 39 problem...
