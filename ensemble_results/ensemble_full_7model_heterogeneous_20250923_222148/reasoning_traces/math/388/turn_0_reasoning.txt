=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu based on the information given about the messages delivered to Ms. Thompson.

1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson**: James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

2. **Messages to Mr. Yu**: According to the problem, James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. To find out how many messages that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson}
   \]
   Substituting the number of messages to Ms. Thompson:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
   \]

3. **Calculating Messages to Mr. Yu**:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{66}{3} = 22
   \]

4. **Total Messages Delivered**: Now, we add the messages delivered to both teachers:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 66 + 22
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 88
   \]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is \( \boxed{88} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
- James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu.

Step 1: Calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu.
Since James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu, we can calculate this as:
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × Messages to Ms. Thompson
Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × 66 = 22 messages

Step 2: Calculate the total number of messages James d...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of messages James delivers to both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

1. **Determine the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson:**
   - According to the problem, James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

2. **Calculate the number of messages delivered to Mr. Yu:**
   - The problem states that James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, I know that James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson

2. For Mr. Yu, he delivers 1/3 as many messages as Ms. Thompson
   * To find 1/3 of 66, I'll divide 66 by 3
   * 66 ÷ 3 = 22 messages for Mr. Yu

3. To find the total messages delivered, I'll add both numbers:
   * Messages to Ms. Thompson: 66
   * Messages to Mr. Yu: 22
   * Total = 66 + 22 = 88 messages

Therefore, James delivers 88 messages total.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we multiply the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 1/3:

66 messages * 1/3 = 22 messages

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

Next, we add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu to find the total number of messages he delivers:

66 messages + 22 messages = 88 messages

So, James del...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.
   * James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

2. Calculate the number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu:
   * Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × Messages to Ms. Thompson
   * Messages to Mr. Yu = 1/3 × 66
   * To calculate 1/3 of 66, we divide 66 by 3:
     66 ÷ 3 = 22
   * So, James deliver...
