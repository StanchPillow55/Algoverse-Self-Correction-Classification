=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money David has left after buying 16 bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts**: 
   Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. We can find the total cost by multiplying the cost of one bolt by the number of bolts he wants to buy.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per bolt} \times \text{Number of bolts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 0.03 \times 16
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   0.03 \times 16 = 0.48
   \]

   So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount of money David has**:
   David starts with $12.48. We need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from this amount to find out how much money he has left.

   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   After buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- David has $12.48
- He wants to buy 16 bolts
- Each bolt costs $0.03

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 16 bolts.
Cost per bolt = $0.03
Total cost of 16 bolts = 16 × $0.03 = $0.48

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money David has left after paying for the bolts.
Initial amount of money = $12.48
Total cost of bolts = $0.48
Amount of money left = Initial amount - Total cost of bolts
Amount o...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much David will spend on the bolts and then subtract that amount from the money he currently has.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the bolts.**

Each bolt costs $0.03, and David wants to buy 16 bolts. To find the total cost, we multiply the cost per bolt by the number of bolts:

\[
\text{Total cost of bolts} = \text{Cost per bolt} \times \text{Number of bolts} = 0.03 \times 16
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
0.03 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the total cost of the bolts is. We do this by multiplying the cost of each bolt by the number of bolts David wants to buy.

The cost of each bolt is $0.03 and David wants to buy 16 bolts. So, the total cost of the bolts is:

$0.03 * 16 = $0.48

Next, we need to find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts. We do this by subtracting the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has.

David has $12.48 and the...
