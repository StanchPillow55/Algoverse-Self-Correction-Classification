=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project using popsicle sticks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of boxes needed**: 
   Bob thinks he needs 56 popsicle sticks. Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks. To find out how many boxes Bob needs, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks by the number of sticks per box.

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{\text{Total popsicle sticks}}{\text{Popsicle sticks per box}} = \frac{56}{8}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{56}{8} = 7
   \]

   So, Bob needs 7 boxes of popsicle sticks.

2. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Each box costs $2.00. To find the total cost for 7 boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box} = 7 \times 2.00
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   7 \times 2.00 = 14.00
   \]

   Therefore, the total cost for the popsicle sticks is $14.00.

3. **Final answer**:
   After calculating the number of boxes needed and the total cost, we conclude that it will cost Bob **$14.00** to build his project. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14.00}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy and then calculate the total cost.

Given information:
- Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument.
- Popsicles come 8 to a box and cost $2.00 per box.

Step 1: Find the number of boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy.
Number of popsicle sticks needed / Number of popsicle sticks per box = Number of boxes needed
56 popsicle sticks / 8 popsicle ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much it will cost Bob to build his project, we need to calculate the number of boxes of popsicles he needs to buy and then determine the total cost based on the price per box.

**Step 1: Determine the number of popsicle sticks needed.**

Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks to recreate the Washington Monument.

**Step 2: Determine how many popsicle sticks are in one box.**

Each box contains 8 popsicles, and therefore 8 popsicle sticks.

**Step 3: Calculate the ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks
* Each box contains 8 popsicle sticks
* Each box costs $2.00

2. Calculate how many boxes Bob needs:
* Number of boxes = Total sticks needed ÷ Sticks per box
* Number of boxes = 56 ÷ 8
* Number of boxes = 7 boxes

3. Calculate total cost:
* Total cost = Number of boxes × Cost per box
* Total cost = 7 × $2.00
* Total cost = $14.00

The...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy in order to have enough popsicle sticks for his project. 

Since each box contains 8 popsicle sticks, we divide the total number of popsicle sticks Bob needs (56) by the number of popsicle sticks in each box (8). 

56 ÷ 8 = 7

So, Bob needs to buy 7 boxes of popsicles.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. 

Since each box of popsicles costs $2.00, we multiply the number of box...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks for his project.
   * The popsicles come in boxes of 8 sticks each.
   * Each box costs $2.00.

2. Calculate the number of boxes needed:
   * Since there are 8 popsicle sticks in each box, we need to find out how many boxes Bob needs to buy to get at least 56 sticks.
   * We can do this by dividing 56 by 8 and rounding up to the nearest who...
