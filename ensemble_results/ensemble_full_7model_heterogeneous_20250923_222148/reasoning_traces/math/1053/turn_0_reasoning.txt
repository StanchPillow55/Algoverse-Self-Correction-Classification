=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we will calculate the cost of each item she purchased step by step.

1. **Cost of the tank top**:  
   Alison bought a tank top for $10.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of tank top} = 10
   \]

2. **Cost of the running shorts**:  
   The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of running shorts} = \text{Cost of tank top} + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Cost of the tennis shoes**:  
   The original price of the tennis shoes is $48, but they are on sale for half price.  
   \[
   \text{Sale price of tennis shoes} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]

4. **Cost of the athletic socks**:  
   The athletic socks are priced at $8, and Alison has a coupon for $2 off.  
   \[
   \text{Cost of athletic socks} = 8 - 2 = 6
   \]

5. **Total cost of all items**:  
   Now we will add the costs of all the items together to find the total amount Alison spent.  
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tank top} + \text{Cost of running shorts} + \text{Sale price of tennis shoes} + \text{Cost of athletic socks}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 10 + 15 + 24 + 6
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:
   - First, add the cost of the tank top and the running shorts:
     \[
     10 + 15 = 25
     \]
   - Next, add the sale price of the tennis shoes:
     \[
     25 + 24 = 49
     \]
   - Finally, add the cost of the athletic socks:
     \[
     49 + 6 = 55
     \]

Thus, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is:
\[
\boxed{55}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the items and their costs:
* Tank top = $10
* Running shorts = Tank top price + $5 = $10 + $5 = $15
* Tennis shoes:
  * Original price = $48
  * Sale price = Half price = $48 รท 2 = $24
* Socks:
  * Original price = $8
  * With $2 coupon = $8 - $2 = $6

2. Now let's add up all the items:
* Tank top: $10
* Running shorts: $15
* Tennis shoes: $24
* Socks: $6

3. Total calculation:
$10 + $15 + $...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out the cost of each item Alison bought:

1. The tank top cost $10.

2. The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.

3. The tennis shoes were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.

4. She had a coupon for $2 off the $8 athletic socks, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Alison spent in total:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoe...
