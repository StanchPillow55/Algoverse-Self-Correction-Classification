=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

1. **Initial Count**: The number of people on the bus after leaving the terminal is \( x \).

2. **First Bus Stop**: At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
   \[
   x + 5
   \]

3. **Second Bus Stop**: At the second bus stop, 7 people got off the bus and 8 more got on. The number of people after 7 got off is:
   \[
   (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2
   \]
   Then, adding the 8 people who got on:
   \[
   (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6
   \]

4. **Total at Third Stop**: We know that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 6 = 20
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 20 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- At the terminal, some people got on the bus.
- At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.
- At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.
- There were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop.

Let's represent the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as "x".

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the first bus stop.
Number of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people initially got on the bus at the terminal. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

2. **First Bus Stop:**
   - At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is \( x + 5 \).

3. **Second Bus Stop:**
   - At the second bus stop, 7...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Let's say x = number of people who got on at terminal

Step 1: Track changes in number of passengers
* Start with x people at terminal
* First stop: Add 5 people
* After first stop: x + 5 people
* Second stop: Subtract 7 people, add 8 people
* After second stop: x + 5 - 7 + 8 = x + 6 people

Step 2: We know there are 20 people total heading to third stop
* Therefore: x + 6 = 20

Step 3: Solve for x
* x + 6 = 20
* x ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as X.

According to the problem, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is X + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is (X + 5) - 7 + 8.

We know from the problem that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up th...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll start with an unknown number of people who got on the bus at the terminal and then follow the events at each bus stop to determine the total number of people on the bus.

Given:
- Some people got on the bus at the terminal (let's call this number x).
- At the first stop, 5 more people got in.
- At the second stop, 7 people got down, and 8 more got in.
- There were a total of 20 people heading to the...
