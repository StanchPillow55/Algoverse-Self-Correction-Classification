=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of times each of Jerome's friends pressed the doorbell and then sum those amounts to find the total number of doorbell rings.

1. **First Friend**: 
   - The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.
   \[
   \text{First Friend} = 20
   \]

2. **Second Friend**: 
   - The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than the first friend. 
   - To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we first calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the first friend's presses:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   - Therefore, the second friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Second Friend} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. **Fourth Friend**: 
   - The problem states that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.
   \[
   \text{Fourth Friend} = 60
   \]

4. **Third Friend**: 
   - The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. 
   - Therefore, the number of times the third friend pressed the doorbell is:
   \[
   \text{Third Friend} = 60 + 10 = 70
   \]

5. **Total Doorbell Rings**: 
   - Now we sum the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{First Friend} + \text{Second Friend} + \text{Third Friend} + \text{Fourth Friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
   \]
   - Performing the addition step by step:
   \[
   20 + 25 = 45
   \]
   \[
   45 + 70 = 115
   \]
   \[
   115 + 60 = 175
   \]

Thus, the total number of doorbell rings made is:
\[
\boxed{175}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First friend's doorbell rings:
* First friend pressed 20 times

2. Second friend's doorbell rings:
* Second friend pressed 1/4 more than first friend
* 1/4 of 20 = 5
* So second friend pressed: 20 + 5 = 25 times

3. Fourth friend's doorbell rings:
* Fourth friend pressed 60 times

4. Third friend's doorbell rings:
* Third friend pressed 10 more than fourth friend
* Fourth friend pressed 60 times
* So third friend...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Second, the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20 and add it to 20. 

1/4 * 20 = 5

So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Third, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times. 

The third fr...
