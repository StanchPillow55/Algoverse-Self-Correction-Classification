=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of legs Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature he encounters and then sum those totals.

1. **Calculate the total legs from spiders:**
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - The total number of legs from spiders can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from spiders} = \text{Number of spiders} \times \text{Legs per spider} = 80 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     80 \times 8 = 640
     \]

2. **Calculate the total legs from insects:**
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - The total number of legs from insects can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from insects} = \text{Number of insects} \times \text{Legs per insect} = 90 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 6 = 540
     \]

3. **Calculate the total legs from rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - The total number of legs from rare mutant invertebrates can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates} = \text{Number of invertebrates} \times \text{Legs per invertebrate} = 3 \times 10
     \]
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

4. **Sum all the legs together:**
   - Now we add the total legs from spiders, insects, and rare mutant invertebrates:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from spiders} + \text{Total legs from insects} + \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30
     \]
     \[
     640 + 540 = 1180
     \]
     \[
     1180 + 30 = 1210
     \]

Thus, the total number of legs that Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology is **1210**.

Final answer: **1210** legs.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find the total number of legs Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature he encounters and then sum those totals.

1. **Calculate the total legs from spiders:**
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - The total number of legs from spiders can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from spiders} = \text{Number of spiders} \times \text{Legs per spider} = 80 \times 8
...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of legs of all the creatures Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology.

Given information:
- 80 spiders with 8 legs each
- 90 insects with 6 legs each
- 3 rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs of the spiders.
Number of spiders × Number of legs per spider = Total legs of spiders
80 × 8 = 640 legs

Step 2: Calculate the total number of legs of the inse...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of legs Jake sees by considering each group of creatures separately and then summing the results.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs from the spiders
- **Number of spiders**: 80
- **Legs per spider**: 8

To find the total number of legs from the spiders, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has:

\[
80 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 640 \text{ legs}
\]...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total legs for the spiders:
* Each spider has 8 legs
* There are 80 spiders
* Spider legs = 80 × 8 = 640 legs

2. Next, let's calculate the total legs for the insects:
* Each insect has 6 legs
* There are 90 insects
* Insect legs = 90 × 6 = 540 legs

3. Finally, let's calculate the total legs for the mutant invertebrates:
* Each mutant has 10 legs
* There are 3 mutants
* Mutant legs = 3...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature separately.

For the spiders, each one has 8 legs and there are 80 of them. So, the total number of spider legs is 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.

For the insects, each one has 6 legs and there are 90 of them. So, the total number of insect legs is 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.

For the mutant invertebrates, each one has 10 legs and there are 3 of them. So, the total number of ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 80 spiders, each with 8 legs.
   * There are 90 insects, each with 6 legs.
   * There are 3 rare mutant invertebrates, each with 10 legs.

2. Calculate the total number of spider legs:
   * Number of spiders = 80
   * Legs per spider = 8
   * Total spider legs = 80 × 8 = 640 legs

3. Calculate the total number of insect legs:
   * Number of insects = 90
   * ...
