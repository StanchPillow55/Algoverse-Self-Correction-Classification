=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total area of the quilt that Octavia is making, we need to calculate the total square footage contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the area from small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt has an area of 3 square feet.
   - Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
   - The total area from small t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = \text{Number of small t-shirts} \times \text{Area per small t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = 11 \times 3 = 33 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area from medium t-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt has an area of 4 square feet.
   - Octavia is using 8 medium t-shirts.
   - The total area from medium t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = \text{Number of medium t-shirts} \times \text{Area per medium t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area from large t-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt has an area of 6 square feet.
   - Octavia is using 6 large t-shirts.
   - The total area from large t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = \text{Number of large t-shirts} \times \text{Area per large t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Sum the areas from all t-shirts:**
   - Now we need to add the areas from small, medium, and large t-shirts to find the total area of the quilt:
   \[
   \text{Total area} = \text{Area from small t-shirts} + \text{Area from medium t-shirts} + \text{Area from large t-shirts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 33 + 32 + 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 101 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Thus, the total area of the quilt that Octavia is making is **101 square feet**. 

Final answer: **101 square feet**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Small t-shirt = 3 square feet of fabric
- Medium t-shirt = 4 square feet of fabric
- Large t-shirt = 6 square feet of fabric
- Octavia uses 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts

To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to calculate the area contributed by each size of t-shirt and then add them together.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine the total square footage of the quilt that Octavia is making, we need to calculate the total area contributed by each size of t-shirt and then sum these areas.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the total area from small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt provides 3 square feet of fabric.
   - Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts.
   - Total area from small t-shirts = Number of small t-shirts × Area per small t-shirt
   \[

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Small t-shirt = 3 square feet
* Medium t-shirt = 4 square feet
* Large t-shirt = 6 square feet
* Number of small shirts = 11
* Number of medium shirts = 8
* Number of large shirts = 6

2. Calculate total square feet from small shirts:
* Small shirts = 11 × 3 = 33 square feet

3. Calculate total square feet from medium shirts:
* Medium shirts = 8 × 4 = 32 square feet

4. Calcu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of each size of t-shirt by the square footage of that size, then add all of those products together.

First, let's calculate the total square footage from the small t-shirts. Octavia is using 11 small t-shirts, and each small t-shirt is 3 square feet. So, the total square footage from the small t-shirts is 11 * 3 = 33 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the total square footage from the medium t-shirts. Octavia is usin...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A small t-shirt provides 3 square feet of fabric.
   * A medium t-shirt provides 4 square feet of fabric.
   * A large t-shirt provides 6 square feet of fabric.
   * Octavia is using 11 small shirts, 8 medium shirts, and 6 large shirts.

2. Calculate the total square feet of fabric from the small shirts:
   * Square feet from small shirts = 3 square feet × 11
   * Squa...
