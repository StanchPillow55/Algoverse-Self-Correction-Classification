=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to first convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the length of Topher's shoe is given in feet and inches, we will convert it entirely to inches.

1. **Convert Topher's shoe length to inches:**
   - Topher's shoe length is 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
     \[
     8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Adding the 4 inches:
     \[
     96 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 100 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Therefore, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 100 inches.

2. **Set up the equation based on the problem statement:**
   - Let \( b \) be the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
   - According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Length of Topher's shoe} = 9b + 10
     \]
   - We know the length of Topher's shoe is 100 inches, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     100 = 9b + 10
     \]

3. **Solve for \( b \):**
   - First, subtract 10 from both sides:
     \[
     100 - 10 = 9b
     \]
     \[
     90 = 9b
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 9:
     \[
     b = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of one of Bobby's shoes is \( b = 10 \) inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches
4 inches
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Step 2: Set up an equation to r...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches, given the relationship between the lengths of Topher's and Bobby's shoes.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Convert Topher's Shoe Length to Inches:**
   - Topher's shoe length is given as 8 feet and 4 inches.
   - First, convert the feet to inches. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, 8 feet is:
     \[
     8 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 96 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Add...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let me convert Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches
   * 8 feet = 8 × 12 = 96 inches
   * Plus 4 inches
   * Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 + 4 = 100 inches

2) Let's say Bobby's shoe length is x inches
   * We know Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times Bobby's shoe
   * We can write this as an equation:
   * 100 = 9x + 10

3) Solve for x
   * 100 = 9x + 10
   * 100 - 10 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches because the length of Bobby's shoe is asked in inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 * 12 = 96 inches. 

Adding the 4 inches, we find that Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches long.

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can set up the equation:

100 = 9B + 10

where B represents the lengt...
