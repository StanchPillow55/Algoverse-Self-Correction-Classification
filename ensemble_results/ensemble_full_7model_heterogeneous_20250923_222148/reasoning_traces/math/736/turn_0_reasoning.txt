=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples Beck has initially.**
   - Boris has 100 apples.
   - Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
   - Therefore, the number of apples Beck has is:
     \[
     \text{Beck's apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
     \]

2. **Calculate the new number of apples after Boris gives Beck 10 apples.**
   - When Boris gives Beck 10 apples, we need to adjust the counts for both Boris and Beck.
   - Boris's new number of apples will be:
     \[
     \text{Boris's new apples} = \text{Boris's initial apples} - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90
     \]
   - Beck's new number of apples will be:
     \[
     \text{Beck's new apples} = \text{Beck's initial apples} + 10 = 77 + 10 = 87
     \]

3. **Determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.**
   - Now we need to find the difference between the number of apples Beck has and the number of apples Boris has:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Boris's new apples} - \text{Beck's new apples} = 90 - 87 = 3
     \]

4. **Final answer.**
   - Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Boris has 100 apples.
- Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
- Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

Step 1: Calculate how many apples Beck has initially.
Boris has 100 apples.
Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
So, Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Step 2: Calculate how many apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples.
Beck had 77 apples initially.
Boris gives Beck 10 apples.
So, Beck now has...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the initial number of apples each person has:**

   - Boris has 100 apples.
   - Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Beck initially has by subtracting 23 from the number of apples Boris has:
     \[
     \text{Beck's initial apples} = 100 - 23 = 77
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of apples each person has after Boris gives Beck 10 apples:**

   - Bori...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many apples Beck has initially:
* Boris has 100 apples
* Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris
* So Beck has: 100 - 23 = 77 apples

2. After Boris gives Beck 10 apples:
* Boris's new amount: 100 - 10 = 90 apples
* Beck's new amount: 77 + 10 = 87 apples

3. To find how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now:
* Difference = Boris's apples - Beck's apples
* Difference = 90 - 87 = 3 apples

The...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many apples Beck initially has. We know that Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, who has 100 apples. So, we subtract 23 from 100 to find out how many apples Beck has:

100 - 23 = 77 apples

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Then, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. To find out how many apples Beck has now, we add these 10 apples to Beck's initial amount of 77 apples:

77 + 10 = 87 apples

So, Beck now has 87 apples.

Finally, we need to find out how ma...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Boris has 100 apples.
   * Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.
   * Boris gives Beck 10 apples.

2. Calculate the number of apples Beck has initially:
   * Beck's apples = Boris's apples - 23
   * Beck's apples = 100 - 23 = 77
   So, Beck has 77 apples before Boris gives him 10 more.

3. Update the number of apples Boris and Beck have after the exchange:
   * Bo...
