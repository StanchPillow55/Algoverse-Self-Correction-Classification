=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to define the number of students in each group based on the information provided.

Let's denote:
- The number of students in each of the two equal groups as \( x \).
- The number of students in the smallest group as \( y \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total number of students is 200.
2. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other two groups.

From the second point, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = x - 10
\]

Now, we can set up the equation for the total number of students:
\[
x + x + y = 200
\]
Substituting \( y \) with \( x - 10 \):
\[
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3x - 10 = 200
\]

Next, we will solve for \( x \):
1. Add 10 to both sides:
\[
3x = 210
\]
2. Divide both sides by 3:
\[
x = 70
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \):
\[
y = x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
\]

Thus, the number of students in the smallest group is \( y = 60 \).

To verify, we can check the total:
- The two equal groups each have 70 students, and the smallest group has 60 students.
- Total = \( 70 + 70 + 60 = 200 \), which matches the total number of students.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students in the smallest group.

Given information:
- The class has 200 students.
- The class is split into 3 groups.
- 2 of the groups are equal in number.
- The third group (the smallest) is 10 less than each of the other groups.

Let's represent the number of students in the two equal groups as x.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of students in the two equal groups and the smalle...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students in each group based on the conditions given.

Let's define the number of students in each group:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of students in each of the two equal groups.
2. The smallest group has 10 fewer students than each of the other groups, so it has \( x - 10 \) students.

According to the problem, the total number of students in the class is 200. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's understand what we know:
   * Total number of students = 200
   * 2 groups are equal in size
   * 1 group is 10 less than each of the other groups
   * Need to find the size of the smallest group

2) Let's say:
   * The size of each of the 2 equal groups = x
   * The size of the smallest group = (x - 10)

3) Since the total number of students is 200:
   * x + x + (x - 10) = 200
   * 2x + (x - 10) = 200
   *...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The smallest group then has x - 10 students.

We know that the total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

This equation represents the sum of the students in the two equal groups (2x) and the students in the smallest group (x - 10) equaling the total number of students (200).

Solving this equation, we first combine like terms:

3x - 10 = 200

Then, we add 1...
