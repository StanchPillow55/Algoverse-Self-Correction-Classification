=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define the number of cookies each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

2. **Given Information**:
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: 
     \[
     K = M - 5
     \]
   - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster: 
     \[
     M = C + 12
     \]
   - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max: 
     \[
     S = M + 23
     \]
   - Katarina has 68 cookies: 
     \[
     K = 68
     \]

3. **Substituting for Max**:
   Since we know \( K = 68 \), we can substitute this value into the equation for \( K \):
   \[
   68 = M - 5
   \]
   To find \( M \), we add 5 to both sides:
   \[
   M = 68 + 5 = 73
   \]

4. **Finding Cookies for the Cookie Monster**:
   Now we can find the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has using the equation for \( M \):
   \[
   M = C + 12
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   73 = C + 12
   \]
   To find \( C \), we subtract 12 from both sides:
   \[
   C = 73 - 12 = 61
   \]

5. **Finding Cookies for Summer**:
   Now we can find the number of cookies Summer has using the equation for \( S \):
   \[
   S = M + 23
   \]
   Substituting \( M = 73 \):
   \[
   S = 73 + 23 = 96
   \]

6. **Calculating the Total Number of Cookies**:
   Now we have the number of cookies for each person:
   - Katarina: \( K = 68 \)
   - Max: \( M = 73 \)
   - Cookie Monster: \( C = 61 \)
   - Summer: \( S = 96 \)

   To find the total number of cookies, we sum these values:
   \[
   \text{Total} = K + M + C + S = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   \[
   68 + 73 = 141
   \]
   \[
   141 + 61 = 202
   \]
   \[
   202 + 96 = 298
   \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   The total number of cookies they have is:
   \[
   \boxed{298}
   \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define the number of cookies each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
   - Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

2. **Given Information**:
   - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max: 
     \[
     K = M - 5
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies Max has.
Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so:
Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies

Step 2: Find the number of cookies the Coo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies each person has and then sum them up to find the total number of cookies.

Let's define the variables based on the information given:

1. Let \( K \) be the number of cookies Katarina has.
2. Let \( M \) be the number of cookies Max has.
3. Let \( C \) be the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has.
4. Let \( S \) be the number of cookies Summer has.

We are given the following relationships:

- Katarina has 5...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Katarina has 68 cookies
* Katarina has 5 less than Max
* Max has 12 more than Cookie Monster
* Summer has 23 more than Max

2. Let's find Max's cookies:
* If Katarina has 5 less than Max, then Max has 5 more than Katarina
* Max's cookies = Katarina's cookies + 5
* Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73 cookies

3. Let's find Cookie Monster's cookies:
* If Max has 12 more than Cookie Mon...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many cookies each person has.

We know that Katarina has 68 cookies.

Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can find out how many cookies Max has by adding 5 to Katarina's total. 

68 + 5 = 73

So, Max has 73 cookies.

We know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster. So, to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, we subtract 12 from Max's total.

73 - 12 = 61

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.

Finally, ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the information given and then find the number of cookies each person has.

Given:
- Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.
- Katarina has 68 cookies.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies Max has.
Katarina's cookies = Max's cookies - 5
68 = Max's cookies - 5
Max's cookies = 68 + 5 = 73
