=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each of the four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. We will use the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the age of Sally Thirtytwo**:
   - We are told that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Sally Four**:
   - The problem states that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Four} = \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Calculate the age of Granny Red**:
   - We know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   \[
   \text{Age of Granny Red} = 2 \times \text{Age of Sally Four} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Calculate the age of Sally Two**:
   - The problem states that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Two} = \text{Age of Granny Red} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Sum the ages of all four birds**:
   - Now we have the ages of all four birds:
     - Sally Two: 19 years
     - Granny Red: 16 years
     - Sally Four: 8 years
     - Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years
   - We will add these ages together to find the total age.
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} + \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8
   \]

6. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   19 + 16 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 8 = 43
   \]
   \[
   43 + 8 = 51
   \]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is:
\[
\boxed{51} \text{ years}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sally Two is 3 years older than Granny Red
- Granny Red is 2 times as old as Sally Four
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo
- Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old

Step 1: Find the age of Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo.
Since Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, then:
Sally Four's age = 8 years

Step 2: Find the age of Granny Red.
Granny...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of each of the four birds and then sum these ages to find the total age.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Sally Thirtytwo's Age:**
   - Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.

2. **Sally Four's Age:**
   - Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   - Therefore, Sally Four is also 8 years old.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know about Sally Thirtytwo:
* Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old

2. We know Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo:
* Sally Four = 8 years old

3. We know Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four:
* Granny Red = 2 × Sally Four
* Granny Red = 2 × 8 = 16 years old

4. We know Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red:
* Sally Two = Granny Red + 3
* Sally Two = 16 + 3 = 19 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by assigning the given information to each bird:

- Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old (given)
- Sally Four = Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old (given)
- Granny Red = 2 * Sally Four = 2 * 8 = 16 years old (since Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four)
- Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years old (since Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red)

Now, to find the total age of the four birds, we simply add up their ages:

Total age = Sally Thirtytwo + Sall...
