=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Deanna's Age:**
   We know from the problem that Deanna is 26 years old.
   \[
   \text{Deanna's age} = 26
   \]

2. **Determine Marcus's Age:**
   The problem states that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21
   \]

3. **Establish the Relationship Between Marcus and Leo:**
   The problem also states that Marcus is half of Leo's age. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]
   Substituting Marcus's age into the equation:
   \[
   21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
   \]

4. **Solve for Leo's Age:**
   To find Leo's age, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   2 \times 21 = \text{Leo's age}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Leo's age} = 42
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

In conclusion, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that:
\[
\text{Leo's age} = 42
\] 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Marcus, Leo, and Deanna based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Deanna's Age:**
   We know from the problem that Deanna is 26 years old.
   \[
   \text{Deanna's age} = 26
   \]

2. **Determine Marcus's Age:**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Marcus is half of Leo's age
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna
- Deanna is 26 years old

Step 1: Find Marcus's age.
Deanna's age = 26 years
Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5 years
Marcus's age = 26 - 5 = 21 years

Step 2: Find the relationship between Marcus's age and Leo's age.
Marcus is half of Leo's age
Marcus's age = 1/2 × Leo's age
21 = 1/2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Marcus and Leo based on the information given.

1. **Identify the known information:**
   - Deanna's age is given as 26 years.

2. **Determine Marcus's age:**
   - We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. Therefore, we can calculate Marcus's age by subtracting 5 from Deanna's age.
   \[
   \text{Marcus's age} = \text{Deanna's age} - 5 = 26 - 5 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine Leo's age:**
   - We are told th...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
* Marcus is half of Leo's age
* Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna
* Deanna is 26 years old

Step 1: Find Marcus's age
* Deanna is 26
* Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna
* So, Marcus = 26 - 5 = 21 years old

Step 2: Find Leo's age
* Marcus is half of Leo's age
* This means: Marcus = Leo ÷ 2
* Or: Leo = Marcus × 2
* Leo = 21 × 2 = 42

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

To verify:
* Deanna is 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out Marcus's age. According to the problem, Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. If Deanna is 26 years old, then Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.

The problem also states that Marcus is half of Leo's age. This means that Leo is 2 times older than Marcus. So, Leo's age is 2 * 21 = 42 years old.

Therefore, Leo is 42 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up equations and solve for Leo's age.

Given:
- Marcus is half of Leo's age.
- Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.
- Deanna is 26 years old.

Step 1: Let's express Marcus's age in terms of Leo's age.
Marcus's age = 1/2 × Leo's age

Step 2: Express Marcus's age in terms of Deanna's age.
Marcus's age = Deanna's age - 5

Step 3: Since Deanna is 26 years old, we ca...
