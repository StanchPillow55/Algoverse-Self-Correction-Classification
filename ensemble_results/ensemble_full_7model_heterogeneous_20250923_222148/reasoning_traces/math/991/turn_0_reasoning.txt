=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Comet's Orbit**: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that it is visible from Earth approximately every 75 years.

2. **Bill's Dad's Age**: Let's denote the year when Bill's dad saw the comet as Year 0. At that time, he was 30 years old.

3. **Bill's Dad's Age When Bill Saw the Comet Again**: Since the comet reappears every 75 years, Bill's dad will see the comet again when he is \(30 + 75 = 105\) years old.

4. **Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet the Second Time**: According to the problem, Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet. 

   - Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the comet. 
   - Therefore, when Bill saw the comet the second time, he was \(3 \times 30 = 90\) years old.

5. **Calculating Bill's Age When He Saw the Comet for the First Time**: 
   - Since the comet appears every 75 years, and Bill's dad saw it when he was 30, we need to determine how many years have passed from the first sighting to the second sighting.
   - The second sighting occurs when Bill's dad is 105 years old, which is 75 years after the first sighting.
   - This means Bill was 90 years old at the second sighting, which is 75 years after the first sighting.

6. **Finding Bill's Age at the First Sighting**: 
   - If Bill is 90 years old at the second sighting (which is 75 years after the first sighting), we can find his age at the first sighting by subtracting 75 from 90:
   \[
   \text{Bill's age at first sighting} = 90 - 75 = 15
   \]

Thus, Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.

**Final Answer**: Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Comet's Orbit**: Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years. This means that it is visible from Earth approximately every 75 years.

2. **Bill's Dad's Age**: Let's denote the year when Bill's dad saw the comet as Year 0. At that time, he was 30 years old.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to understand the timeline of events related to Comet Halley's appearances and the ages of Bill and his father.

1. **Identify the key events:**
   - Bill's dad saw Comet Halley when he was 30 years old.
   - Comet Halley appears every 75 years.
   - Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet.

2. **Determine Bill's age during his second sighting:**
   - Bill's dad was 30 years old ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify the key information:
* Comet Halley appears every 75 years
* Bill's dad saw it when he was 30 years old
* Bill saw it a second time when he was 3 Ã— 30 = 90 years old
* We need to find Bill's age when he first saw it

2) Since Bill saw it a second time, he must have seen it 75 years before that time
* If Bill was 90 at second viewing
* Then his first viewing was 75 years earlier
* So: 90 - 75 = 15 y...

--- Model 5 Response ---
Model 5 (replicate:meta/meta-llama-3-70b): REPLICATE_API_ERROR: ReplicateError Details:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet for the second time.

Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, this means Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
   * Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
   * Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

2. Find out when Bill's dad saw the Comet:
   * Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.

3. Calculate when Bill saw the Comet for the second time...
