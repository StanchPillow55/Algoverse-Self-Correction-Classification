=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many friends Amy has based on the information given about Lily's friends.

1. **Identify the number of friends Lily has**: 
   According to the problem, Lily made 50 friends.

2. **Determine how many friends Amy has**:
   The problem states that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Since Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has by adding 20 to the number of friends Lily has:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of friends both Lily and Amy have together**:
   To find the total number of friends they have together, we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
   \[
   \text{Total friends} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + \text{Number of friends Amy has}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total friends} = 50 + 70 = 120
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is \( \boxed{120} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Since Lily made 50 friends, we can find out how many friends Amy made by adding 20 to Lily's total. 

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 (the extra friends Amy made) = 70 friends

So, Amy made 70 friends.

To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add Lily's friends (50) to Amy's friends (70).

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together.
