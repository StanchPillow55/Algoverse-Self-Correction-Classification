=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then compare the two distances.

### Step 1: Calculate Matteo's Distance
Matteo's speed is 55 miles per hour, and he traveled for 4 hours. We can use the formula for distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For Matteo:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Matteo} = 55 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Matteo} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Shandy's Distance
Shandy's speed is 45 miles per hour, and she traveled for 10 hours. We will use the same distance formula:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Shandy} = 45 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Distance}_{Shandy} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the Distances
Now we need to find out how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo. We do this by subtracting Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{Shandy} - \text{Distance}_{Matteo}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 450 \, \text{miles} - 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Difference} = 230 \, \text{miles}
\]

### Final Answer
Shandy drove **230 miles** farther than Matteo.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by Matteo and Shandy, and then find the difference between them.

Given information:
- Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.
- Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled by Matteo.
Matteo's distance = Speed × Time
Matteo's distance = 55 miles per hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance trav...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both Matteo and Shandy and then find the difference between the two distances.

**Step 1: Calculate Matteo's distance.**

Matteo traveled at a speed of 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. The formula to calculate distance is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

For Matteo:

\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how far Matteo traveled
* Distance = Speed × Time
* Matteo's speed = 55 miles per hour
* Matteo's time = 4 hours
* Matteo's distance = 55 × 4 = 220 miles

2. Next, let's find how far Shandy traveled
* Distance = Speed × Time
* Shandy's speed = 45 miles per hour
* Shandy's time = 10 hours
* Shandy's distance = 45 × 10 = 450 miles

3. To find how much farther Shandy drove
* Difference = Shandy's d...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to find out how many miles each person traveled. We do this by multiplying the speed at which they traveled by the time they spent traveling. 

For Matteo, this would be 55 miles per hour * 4 hours = 220 miles.

For Shandy, this would be 45 miles per hour * 10 hours = 450 miles.

To find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract the distance Matteo drove from the distance Shandy drove.

This would be 450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles....

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many more miles Shandy drove compared to Matteo.

Given:
- Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.
- Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Matteo traveled.
Distance = Speed × Time
Matteo's distance = 55 miles/hour × 4 hours = 220 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance Shandy traveled.
Distance = Speed × Time
Shandy's distance = 45 ...
