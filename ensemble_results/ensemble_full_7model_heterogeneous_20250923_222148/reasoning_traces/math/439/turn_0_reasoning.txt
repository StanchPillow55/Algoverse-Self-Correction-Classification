=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne so that she arrives at the theater 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - The problem states that the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's travel time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the time difference needed:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, we need to find out when Bernadette should arrive:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = \text{Wayne's arrival time} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since arriving at -1 minutes doesn't make sense in this context, we need to interpret this as Bernadette needing to leave earlier to ensure she arrives at the theater before Wayne.

4. **Calculate the time Bernadette should leave:**
   - Bernadette takes 16 minutes to reach the theater. To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she needs to leave:
     \[
     \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Wayne's arrival time} - 5 \text{ minutes} - \text{Bernadette's travel time}
     \]
     \[
     = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     = -1 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -17 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette needs to leave 17 minutes before Wayne's departure time.

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**
   - Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, he will leave at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's departure time} = 0 \text{ minutes} \text{ (when he leaves)}
     \]
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{Wayne's departure time} - 17 \text{ minutes} = 0 \text{ minutes} - 17 \text{ minutes} = -17 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

Thus, the final answer is that Bernadette should leave **17 minutes earlier** than Wayne.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and the time it takes for Wayne to get to the theater, and then calculate the difference between the two.

Given information:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater
* Bernadette's drive takes 4 times longer than Wayne's
* Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne

2. Calculate Bernadette's drive time:
* Bernadette's drive = 4 × Wayne's drive
* Bernadette's drive = 4 × 4 minutes
* Bernadette's drive = 16 minutes

3. Figure out when they need to arrive:
* Let's say Wayne arrives at...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Since it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, it would take Bernadette 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. This means she needs to leave her apartment 5 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel. However, since her drive is longer, she needs to leave even earlier.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
   * The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
   * It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. Calculate the time it takes Bernadette to be driven to the theater:
   * Bernadette's drive time = 4 × Wayne's drive time
   * Bernadette's drive time = 4 ×...
