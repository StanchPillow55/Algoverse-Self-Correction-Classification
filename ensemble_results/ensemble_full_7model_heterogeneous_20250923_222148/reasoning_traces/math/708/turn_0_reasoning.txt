=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring at a rate of $12 per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks**: 
   - A week has 7 days. Therefore, in 2 weeks, the total number of days is:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total charge for 14 days**:
   - Alex charges $12 per day. To find the total charge for 14 days, we multiply the daily charge by the number of days:
   \[
   14 \text{ days} \times 12 \text{ dollars/day} = 168 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is **$168**.

Final answer: **$168**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Alex charges $12 per day
* We need to find the cost for 2 weeks
* Each week has 7 days

2. Let's calculate the cost for one week:
* Cost per week = $12 × 7 days

* Cost for 2 weeks = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

Final Answer: $168

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Alex charges for one week and then multiply that by 2 to get the total for two weeks.

First, let's find out how much Alex charges for one week. Since she charges $12 per day, and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply $12 by 7.

$12/day * 7 days/week = $84/week

Now that we know Alex charges $84 for one week of tutoring, we can find out how much she charges for two weeks. We do this by multiplying $84 by 2.

$84/week *...
