=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs Janet has left after she eats some and bakes muffins, and then calculate how much money she makes from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market.

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day:**
   - Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes:**
   - Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning.
   - She also uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs she consumes each day is:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs consumed} = 3 + 4 = 7 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of eggs remaining after consumption:**
   - To find out how many eggs are left after Janet eats and bakes, we subtract the total eggs consumed from the total eggs laid:
     \[
     \text{Remaining eggs} = \text{Total eggs laid} - \text{Total eggs consumed}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining eggs} = 16 - 7 = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the revenue from selling the remaining eggs:**
   - Janet sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling the remaining eggs is:
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = \text{Remaining eggs} \times \text{Price per egg}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue} = 9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Ducks lay 16 eggs per day
* Janet uses 3 eggs for breakfast
* Janet uses 4 eggs for muffins
* Remaining eggs are sold for $2 each

2. Calculate how many eggs Janet uses herself:
* Breakfast eggs: 3
* Muffin eggs: 4
* Total eggs used = 3 + 4 = 7 eggs

3. Calculate remaining eggs available to sell:
* Total eggs = 16
* Eggs used = 7
* Eggs to sell = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs

4. Ca...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 

Every day, she uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins. 

So, she uses a total of 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs per day for her own use.

This means that she has 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market every day.

She sells each of these eggs for $2. 

So, she makes 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 at the farmers' market every day.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
