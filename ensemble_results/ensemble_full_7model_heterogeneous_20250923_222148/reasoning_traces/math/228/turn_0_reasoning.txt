=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces Kalinda and her mom can place together per minute and then calculate how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

1. **Determine Kalinda's rate of placing pieces:**
   - Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine her mom's rate of placing pieces:**
   - Her mom can place half as many pieces as Kalinda. Therefore, her mom's rate is:
     \[
     \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4 \text{ pieces}}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate their combined rate:**
   - To find their combined rate, we add Kalinda's rate and her mom's rate:
     \[
     \text{Combined rate} = \text{Kalinda's rate} + \text{Mom's rate} = 4 \text{ pieces/minute} + 2 \text{ pieces/minute} = 6 \text{ pieces/minute}
     \]

4. **Determine how long it will take to complete the puzzle:**
   - The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360. To find the time it takes to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
     \[
     \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total pieces}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the time from minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Thus, it will take Kalinda and her mom a total of **1 hour** to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Final answer: **1 hour**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of pieces they can add per minute and then calculate the time it will take to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

Given information:
- The puzzle has 360 pieces.
- Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.
- Kalinda's mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Kalinda's mom can add per minute.
Kalinda's mom's pieces per minute = 1/2 × Kalinda's pieces pe...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the combined rate at which Kalinda and her mom can add pieces to the puzzle and then calculate how long it will take them to complete the 360-piece puzzle.

### Step 1: Determine the individual rates of Kalinda and her mom.

- **Kalinda's Rate:** Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute.

- **Mom's Rate:** Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. Therefore, her rate is:
  \[
  \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total puzzle pieces = 360
* Kalinda's rate = 4 pieces per minute
* Mom's rate = half of Kalinda's = 2 pieces per minute

2. Calculate their combined rate:
* Combined rate = Kalinda's rate + Mom's rate
* Combined rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute

3. Calculate total minutes needed:
* Time = Total pieces ÷ Combined rate
* Time = 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes

4. Convert minutes ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. 

Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so it will take them 60 / 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

So, the final answer is that it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The puzzle has 360 pieces.
   * Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.
   * Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.

2. Calculate how many pieces Kalinda's mom can place per minute:
   * Kalinda's mom's rate = 1/2 × Kalinda's rate
   * Kalinda's mom's rate = 1/2 × 4 pieces per minute
   * Kalinda's mom's rate = 2 pieces per minute

3. Calcula...
