=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party, we need to calculate the total cost of the activities she wants to do and then see how many friends can be accommodated within her budget of $90.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per person for mini-golf and arcade tokens
- **Cost of mini-golf per person**: $5
- **Cost of arcade tokens per person**: $5

Total cost per person for mini-golf and arcade tokens:
\[
\text{Total cost per person} = \text{Cost of mini-golf} + \text{Cost of arcade tokens} = 5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for go-karts per person
- **Cost of go-karts per ride**: $10
- **Number of rides**: 2

Total cost for go-karts per person:
\[
\text{Total cost for go-karts per person} = \text{Cost per ride} \times \text{Number of rides} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost per person
Now, we add the total costs for mini-golf, arcade tokens, and go-karts:
\[
\text{Total cost per person} = \text{Cost for mini-golf and arcade tokens} + \text{Cost for go-karts} = 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many people can be accommodated within the budget
Morgan's total budget is $90. We need to find out how many people (including Morgan) can be accommodated within this budget.

Let \( n \) be the total number of people (Morgan plus her friends). The total cost for \( n \) people is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = n \times \text{Total cost per person} = n \times 30
\]

We need this total cost to be less than or equal to $90:
\[
n \times 30 \leq 90
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)
To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the inequality by 30:
\[
n \leq \frac{90}{30} = 3
\]

This means that Morgan can invite a total of 3 people (including herself).

### Step 6: Determine the number of friends Morgan can invite
Since \( n \) includes Morgan, the number of friends she can invite is:
\[
\text{Number of friends} = n - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2
\]

### Final Answer
Morgan can invite **2 friends** to her birthday party.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many friends Morgan can invite to her birthday party given her budget and the costs of the activities she wants to include. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define the Costs
Morgan wants each person, including herself, to:
- Play one round of mini-golf, which costs $5.
- Have $5 in arcade tokens.
- Ride the go-karts twice, with each ride costing $10.

Let's calculate the total cost per person for thes...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the costs per person:
* Mini-golf: $5 per person
* Arcade tokens: $5 per person
* Go-karts: $10 ร 2 rides = $20 per person
* Total cost per person = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30 per person

2. Morgan has a budget of $90 total

3. To find how many friends she can invite:
* Remember Morgan herself needs to be included in the costs
* Let's divide $90 by $30 to see total number of people
* $90 รท $30 = 3 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost for Morgan to do all the activities. 

A round of mini-golf costs $5, arcade tokens cost $5, and two rides on the go-karts cost $10 each, so $20 in total. 

So, the total cost for Morgan is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Now, let's subtract this amount from the total budget to see how much is left for her friends. 

$90 (total budget) - $30 (Morgan's cost) = $60 left for her friends.

Now, let's calculate how m...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Morgan has a budget of $90 for her birthday party.
   * Each person (including Morgan) should get:
     - One round of mini-golf, which costs $5 per person.
     - $5 in arcade tokens.
