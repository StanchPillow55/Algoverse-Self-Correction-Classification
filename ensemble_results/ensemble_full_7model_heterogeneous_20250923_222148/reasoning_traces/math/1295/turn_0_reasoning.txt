=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate Ryan's total allowance for 3 weeks.**
   - Ryan earns $6 each week.
   - For 3 weeks, the total allowance is:
     \[
     \text{Total Allowance} = 6 \text{ dollars/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.**
   - Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought a total of 4 cones (1 for himself + 3 for friends).
   - Each ice cream cone costs $1.25.
   - The total cost for the ice cream cones is:
     \[
     \text{Total Ice Cream Cost} = 4 \text{ cones} \times 1.25 \text{ dollars/cone} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream.**
   - We subtract the total cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance:
     \[
     \text{Money Left} = \text{Total Allowance} - \text{Total Ice Cream Cost} = 18 \text{ dollars} - 5 \text{ dollars} = 13 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.**
   - Each movie ticket costs $6.50.
   - To find out how many tickets Ryan can buy, we divide the money he has left by the cost of one ticket:
     \[
     \text{Number of Tickets} = \frac{\text{Money Left}}{\text{Cost per Ticket}} = \frac{13 \text{ dollars}}{6.50 \text{ dollars/ticket}} \approx 2
     \]
   - To be precise, we perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{13}{6.50} = 2
     \]
   - Since Ryan cannot buy a fraction of a ticket, we take the whole number part of the result.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Ryan can buy **2 movie tickets**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Ryan's allowance for 3 weeks is calculated by multiplying the weekly allowance by the number of weeks. So, $6/week * 3 weeks = $18.

Next, we need to calculate how much Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream for himself and 3 friends, so that's 4 ice cream cones in total. Each cone costs $1.25, so the total cost for ice cream is $1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5.

Now, we need to subtract the cost of the ice cream from Ryan's total allowance to find out how much money...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Calculate Ryan's total allowance:
   * Ryan's weekly allowance = $6
   * Number of weeks he completed his chores = 3
   * Total allowance = Weekly allowance × Number of weeks
   * Total allowance = $6 × 3 = $18

2. Calculate the cost of ice cream cones:
   * Cost of one ice cream cone = $1.25
   * Number of ice cream cones bought = 4 (for himself and 3 friends)
   * Total cost of ice cream cones = Cost o...
