Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total volume of medicine Saanvi uses for one dose and then calculate the total volume for 8 doses.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of the second medicine.**

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

First, we calculate how much of the second medicine is used:

\[
\text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times \text{Amount of first medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
3 \times 14 = 42 \, \text{mL}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total volume for one dose.**

Now, we add the volumes of both medicines to find the total volume for one dose:

\[
\text{Total volume for one dose} = \text{Amount of first medicine} + \text{Amount of second medicine}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total volume for one dose} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total volume for 8 doses.**

Now that we know the total volume for one dose, we can find the total volume for 8 doses by multiplying the volume of one dose by 8:

\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times \text{Total volume for one dose} = 8 \times 56 \, \text{mL}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
8 \times 56 = 448 \, \text{mL}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total volume of medicine in 8 doses is 

\[
\boxed{448 \, \text{mL}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of medicine in one dose and then multiply it by the number of doses.

Given information:
- Saanvi had to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
- We need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.

Step 1: Find the amount of the second medicine.
Amount of the second medicine = 3 × 14 mL = 42 mL

Step 2: Find the total amount of medicine in one dose.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of medicine in one dose and then calculate the total amount for 8 doses.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the amount of the first medicine in one dose:**
   - Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine.

2. **Determine the amount of the second medicine in one dose:**
   - The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine.
   - Therefore, the amount of the second medicine is \(3 \times 14 \...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* First medicine = 14 mL
* Second medicine = 3 × 14 mL = 42 mL

2. Calculate total medicine in one dose:
* Total per dose = First medicine + Second medicine
* Total per dose = 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

3. Calculate total medicine for 8 doses:
* Total for 8 doses = 56 mL × 8
* Total for 8 doses = 448 mL

Reasoning:
- We first had to find how much of the second medicine was needed b...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much of the second medicine Saanvi uses for one dosage. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

So, for one dosage, Saanvi uses 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. To find out how much medicine she uses in total for one dosage, we add these two amounts together.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

This means that one dosage is 56 mL. To find out how much medicine would b...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * For one dose, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine.
   * We need to find the total amount of medicine in 8 doses.

2. Calculate the amount of the second medicine in one dose:
   * The second medicine is 3 times the amount of the first medicine.
   * Amount of the second medicine = 3 × 14 mL
   * Amount of the...
