=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time spent peeling and cutting each potato.

1. **Time to Peel One Potato**: 
   - Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. 
   - To convert this into seconds (since the cutting time is given in seconds), we use the conversion factor that 1 minute = 60 seconds.
   \[
   1.5 \text{ minutes} = 1.5 \times 60 = 90 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Time to Cut One Potato**:
   - Billy takes 5 seconds to cut one potato.

3. **Total Time for One Potato**:
   - Now, we add the time to peel and the time to cut one potato:
   \[
   \text{Total time for one potato} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cut} = 90 \text{ seconds} + 5 \text{ seconds} = 95 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **Total Time for 60 Potatoes**:
   - To find the total time for all 60 potatoes, we multiply the time for one potato by the number of potatoes:
   \[
   \text{Total time for 60 potatoes} = 95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
   \]

5. **Convert Total Time to Minutes**:
   - To convert the total time from seconds back to minutes, we divide by 60:
   \[
   5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 95 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes is **95 minutes**.

Final Answer: **95 minutes**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes Billy to peel and cut all 60 potatoes.

Given information:
- Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
- It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes (90 seconds) to peel a potato.
- It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut up a potato.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to peel all 60 potatoes.
Time to peel one potato × Number of potatoes = Total time to peel all potatoes
90 seconds × 60 potat...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required to peel and cut all 60 potatoes. We'll break down the problem into two parts: the time taken to peel the potatoes and the time taken to cut them.

### Step 1: Calculate the Time to Peel the Potatoes

Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato. Since there are 60 potatoes, we can calculate the total peeling time as follows:

\[
\text{Total peeling time} =...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total number of potatoes = 60
* Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
* Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds

2. Let's convert everything to the same time unit (minutes)
* Time to cut one potato = 5 seconds = 5/60 minutes ≈ 0.083 minutes

3. Calculate total time per potato:
* Time per potato = Peeling time + Cutting time
* Time per potato = 1.5 minutes + 0.083 minutes
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert all the time measurements to the same unit for easy calculation. Since the time to peel a potato is given in minutes, we will convert the time to cut a potato from seconds to minutes. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is equal to 5/60 = 0.08333 minutes.

Next, we calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato. This is done by adding the time it takes to peel a potato to the time it takes to cut a potato. 

1.5 minutes...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Billy has 60 potatoes to peel and cut.
   * It takes Billy about 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel each potato.
   * It takes Billy about 5 seconds to cut each potato.

2. Calculate the total time it takes to peel all the potatoes:
   * Time to peel one potato = 90 seconds
   * Number of potatoes = 60
   * Total peeling time = 90 seconds × 60
   * Total peeling time ...
