Final Answer: To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip, we will break down the problem into parts based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days
Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. 

\[
\text{Distance for first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days
Over the next 2 days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 

First, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:

\[
30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
\]

This distance of 240 km is the total distance for the next 2 days. Since he traveled this distance over 2 days, we can find the average distance per day:

\[
\text{Average distance per day for next 2 days} = \frac{240 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ days}} = 120 \text{ km/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the day he wasn't traveling
On the next day, Tom did not travel at all, so the distance for that day is:

\[
\text{Distance for that day} = 0 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the second week
During the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. 

\[
\text{Distance for second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled
Now, we can sum up all the distances traveled:

- Distance for the first 4 days: 800 km
- Distance for the next 2 days: 240 km
- Distance for the day he wasn't traveling: 0 km
- Distance for the second week: 2100 km

\[
\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[
\boxed{3140 \text{ km}}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week trip. We'll break down the problem into parts based on the information given for each segment of the trip.

### First Week

1. **First 4 Days:**
   - Tom traveled 200 kilometers each day.
   - Total distance for the first 4 days:
     \[
     4 \text{ days} \times 200 \text{ km/day} = 800 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Next 2 Days:**
   - Tom traveled a total of 30% of the distance h...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate distance for first 4 days
* Daily distance = 200 km
* Number of days = 4
* Total distance for first 4 days = 200 × 4 = 800 km

2. Next, calculate distance for days 5-6
* This is 30% of first 4 days' distance
* 30% of 800 km = 800 × 0.30 = 240 km

3. Day 7
* No travel = 0 km

4. Second week (days 8-14)
* Daily distance = 300 km
* Number of days = 7
* Total distance for second week = 300 × 7 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers each day, we multiply 200 by 4:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days. We know this is 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days. So, we multiply 800 km by 30% (or 0.30):

800 km * 0.30 = 240 km

On the seventh day, Tom didn't travel at all, so we don...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

1. First, let's calculate the distance Tom traveled in the first 4 days:
   * He traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days.
   * Total distance in the first 4 days = 200 km × 4 = 800 km

2. Next, let's find the distance he traveled over the next two days:
   * He traveled 30% of the distance from the first four days.
   * 30% of 800 km = 0.3 × 800 km = 240 km

3. On the next day, he didn...
