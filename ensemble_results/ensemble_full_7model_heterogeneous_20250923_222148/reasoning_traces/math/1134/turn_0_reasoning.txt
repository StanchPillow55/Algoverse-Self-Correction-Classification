Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jane has saved so far and how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

1. **Calculate Jane's current savings:**
   Jane saves $4 each week and has been saving for 8 weeks. We can calculate her total savings so far by multiplying her weekly savings by the number of weeks:

   \[
   \text{Current savings} = \text{Weekly savings} \times \text{Number of weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Current savings} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:**
   Next, we need to find out how much more money Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60. We can do this by subtracting her current savings from her goal:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Current savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining amount:**
   Now, we need to find out how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save the remaining $28 if she continues to save $4 each week. We can find the number of weeks by dividing the amount needed by her weekly savings:

   \[
   \text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Weekly savings}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save enough money to reach her goal of $60.

Final answer: **7 weeks**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jane saves $4 of her allowance every week.
- She has been saving for the past 8 weeks.
- She wants to save a total of $60.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.
Amount saved per week = $4
Number of weeks = 8
Total amount saved = $4 × 8 = $32

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount Jane needs to save to reach her goal of $60.
Remaining amount to save = $60 - $32 = $28

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more weeks Jane needs to save $4 per week in order to reach a total savings of $60.

**Step 1: Calculate Jane's current savings.**

Jane saves $4 each week and has been saving for 8 weeks. To find her current savings, we multiply the amount she saves per week by the number of weeks she has saved:

\[
\text{Current Savings} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much Jane has saved so far:
* She saves $4 per week
* She has been saving for 8 weeks
* Current savings = $4 × 8 weeks = $32

2. Now, let's find how much more she needs to save to reach $60:
* Target amount = $60
* Current savings = $32
* Additional amount needed = $60 - $32 = $28

3. Since she saves $4 per week, let's calculate how many more weeks it will take:
* Additional amount need...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is $4 * 8 = $<<4*8=32>>32.

She wants to save a total of $60. So, she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save is $28 / $4 = <<28/4=7>>7 weeks.

So, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks to have a total of $60.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jane saves $4 every week.
   * She has been saving for the past 8 weeks.
   * We need to find out how many more weeks she needs to save to reach a total of $60.

2. Calculate the amount Jane has saved so far:
   * Amount saved per week = $4
   * Number of weeks she has been saving = 8
   * Total amount saved = Amount saved per week × Number of weeks
   * Total am...
