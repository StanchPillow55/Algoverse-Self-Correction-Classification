=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold over the course of 3 days. We will break down the earnings from sunflowers and bouquets, and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day

1. **Earnings from Sunflowers**: 
   - Faraday earns $26 from selling sunflowers each day.
   - The cost of each sunflower is $2.
   - To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{\text{Earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Earnings from Bouquets**: 
   - Faraday earns $56 from selling bouquets each day.
   - The cost of each bouquet is $8.
   - To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet:
     \[
     \text{Number of bouquets sold} = \frac{\text{Earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold from the bouquets is:
\[
\text{Sunflowers from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets sold} \times \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold per day

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold per day by adding the sunflowers sold directly and those sold through bouquets:
\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold per day} = \text{Sunflowers sold} + \text{Sunflowers from bouquets} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days

Finally, we multiply the total number of sunflowers sold per day by the number of days (3 days):
\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total sunflowers sold per day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Single sunflower costs $2
* Bouquet costs $8 and contains 12 sunflowers
* Daily earnings from single sunflowers = $26
* Daily earnings from bouquets = $56
* We need to find total sunflowers sold in 3 days

2. Calculate how many single sunflowers are sold per day:
* Price of one sunflower = $2
* Daily earnings from single sunflowers = $26
* Number of single sunflowers s...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sells each day. 

To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings from the sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower. So, $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings from the bouquets by the cost of each bouquet. So, $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold in t...
