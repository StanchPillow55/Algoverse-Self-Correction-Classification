=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Bob has a certain number of marbles, which we will denote as \( x \).
   - If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
   - We need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his current marbles.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - We know that 1 dozen equals 12. Therefore, 2 dozen equals:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24
     \]
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can express this as an equation:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 from both sides:
     \[
     x + 24 - 24 = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

4. **Finding the Number of Marbles After Losing 10**:
   - Now, we need to determine how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles. We can calculate this by subtracting 10 from the number of marbles he currently has:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, after losing 10 marbles, Bob will have:
     \[
     \boxed{26}
     \] marbles.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bob has a certain number of marbles.
- If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
- If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?

Step 1: Find the number of marbles Bob had initially.
2 dozen = 24 marbles
Bob will have 60 marbles if he receives 2 dozen more.
Initial number of marbles = 60 - 24 = 36 marbles

Step 2: Find the number of marbles Bob will...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Bob initially has and then calculate how many marbles he will have after losing 10 of them.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has an unknown number of marbles, which we'll call \( x \).
   - If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen marbles is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \)...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many marbles Bob has initially:
   * If he gets 2 dozen more marbles, he'll have 60 marbles
   * 2 dozen = 2 × 12 = 24 marbles
   * So: Initial marbles + 24 = 60
   * Initial marbles = 60 - 24 = 36 marbles

2. Now we know Bob currently has 36 marbles
   * The question asks what happens if he loses 10 marbles
   * So: Current marbles - 10 = Final marbles
   * 36 - 10 = 26 marbles

Therefore, ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of marbles Bob initially has as x.

According to the problem, if Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 2 dozen equals 24. So, we can write the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To find the value of x, we subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, the number of marbles he will have is:

36 - 10 = 26

So, if Bob loses 1...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Bob has an unknown number of marbles.
   * If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles in total.
   * We need to find out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 marbles from his current number of marbles.

2. Find the number of marbles Bob currently has:
   * If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.
   * 2 dozen = 2 ×...
