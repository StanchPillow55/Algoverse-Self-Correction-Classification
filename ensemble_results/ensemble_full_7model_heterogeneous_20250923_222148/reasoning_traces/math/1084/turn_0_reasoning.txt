=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( S \) be the amount of fence Sam gets.
   - Let \( H \) be the amount of fence Harry gets.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total amount of fence they have is 100 feet. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     S + H = 100
     \]
   - The problem also states that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam. This gives us another equation:
     \[
     H = S + 60
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     S + (S + 60) = 100
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     2S + 60 = 100
     \]

4. **Solve for \( S \)**:
   - Now, we will isolate \( S \):
     \[
     2S = 100 - 60
     \]
     \[
     2S = 40
     \]
     \[
     S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]

5. **Find \( H \)**:
   - Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( H \) using the equation \( H = S + 60 \):
     \[
     H = 20 + 60 = 80
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 80 feet of fence. The problem asks how much is left over for Sam. Since the total amount of fence is 100 feet and Sam is allocated 20 feet, there is no leftover fence for Sam.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Sam has } 20 \text{ feet of fence, and there is no leftover.}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence between them.
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.

To find the amount of fence left over for Sam, we need to first find out how much fence each person gets.

Step 1: Let's represent Sam's portion as x.
Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, Harry's portion can be represented as x + 60.

Step 2: We know that the total fence is 100 feet, so w...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fence Sam receives given that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, and Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam.

Let's define:
- \( S \) as the amount of fence Sam receives (in feet).
- \( H \) as the amount of fence Harry receives (in feet).

According to the problem, the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can write the equation:
\[ S + H = 100 \]

We are also told that Harry receives 60 feet more than Sam, which...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Total fence length = 100 feet
* Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam
* Need to find Sam's portion

Step 1: Let's express Harry's portion in terms of Sam's
* If Sam gets x feet
* Then Harry gets (x + 60) feet

Step 2: Set up equation based on total length
* Sam's portion + Harry's portion = Total length
* x + (x + 60) = 100

Step 3: Solve for x (Sam's portion)
* x + x + 60 = 100
* 2x + 60 = 100
* 2x = 40
* x = 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the length of the fence that Sam gets as S and the length of the fence that Harry gets as H. 

According to the problem, the total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write this as an equation:

S + H = 100

The problem also states that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, which we can also write as an equation:

H = S + 60

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it by substitution. We substitute the second equation into the first one:

S...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sam and Harry have a total of 100 feet of fence.
   * They agree to split the fence, with Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam.

2. Let's assign a variable to represent Sam's share of the fence:
   * Let x = Sam's share of the fence (in feet)

3. Express Harry's share of the fence in terms of Sam's share:
   * Harry's share = Sam's share + 60 feet
   * Harry's sha...
