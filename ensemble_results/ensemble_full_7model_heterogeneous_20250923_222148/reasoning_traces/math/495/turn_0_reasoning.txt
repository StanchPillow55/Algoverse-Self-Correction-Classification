Final Answer: To find out how many minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of hours Charisma works in a day:**
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Calculate the number of breaks she takes in a day:**
   Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, we need to find out how many hours she works in a day:
   - She works for 8 hours, which means she will take a break at the end of each hour.
   - Therefore, she will take 8 breaks in a day (one at the end of each hour).

3. **Calculate the total walking time in a day:**
   Each break lasts for 5 minutes. So, the total walking time in a day can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in a day} = \text{Number of breaks} \times \text{Duration of each break}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in a day} = 8 \text{ breaks} \times 5 \text{ minutes/break} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total walking time over 5 days:**
   Now, we need to find out how much she walks over 5 days:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time over 5 days} = \text{Total walking time in a day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time over 5 days} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   After 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{200 \text{ minutes}}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Charisma works for 8 hours every day and walks for 5 minutes every hour. 

To find out how many minutes she walks in a day, we multiply the number of hours she works by the number of minutes she walks each hour. 

8 hours/day * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes/day

So, Charisma walks 40 minutes each day. 

To find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days, we multiply the number of minutes she walks each day by the number of days. 

40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes
