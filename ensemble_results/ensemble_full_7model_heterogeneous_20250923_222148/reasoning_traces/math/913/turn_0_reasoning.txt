Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many yellow balloons Benny threw bologna at, given the total number of pieces of bologna thrown and the number of red balloons.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.
   - From the problem, we know that \( r = 20 \) (the number of red balloons).

2. **Determine the pieces of bologna thrown:**
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Therefore, the total pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Bologna at red balloons} = 2 \times r = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. Therefore, the total pieces of bologna thrown at yellow balloons is:
     \[
     \text{Bologna at yellow balloons} = 3 \times y
     \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - The total pieces of bologna thrown is given as 58. Thus, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Bologna at red balloons} + \text{Bologna at yellow balloons} = 58
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions we found:
     \[
     40 + 3y = 58
     \]

4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - To isolate \( y \), subtract 40 from both sides:
     \[
     3y = 58 - 40
     \]
     \[
     3y = 18
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of yellow balloons in the bundle is \( y = 6 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon
- Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon
- Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna
- 20 of the balloons were red

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons.
Number of pieces of bologna thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per red balloon × 20 red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calc...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yellow balloons were in the bundle. We know the following:

1. Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
2. Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
3. Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
4. There are 20 red balloons.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
- Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

From the problem, we know:
- \( r = 20 \) (sin...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
* 2 pieces of bologna per red balloon
* 3 pieces of bologna per yellow balloon
* Total bologna pieces thrown = 58
* Number of red balloons = 20
* Need to find number of yellow balloons

Step 1: Calculate bologna pieces used for red balloons
* Bologna for red balloons = (2 pieces × 20 red balloons)
* Bologna for red balloons = 40 pieces

Step 2: Calculate remaining bologna pieces for yellow balloon...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as Y. 

Since Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there were 20 red balloons, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

We know that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. Therefore, he threw 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.

So, there were 6 yellow b...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   * Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   * Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.
   * There were 20 red balloons in the bundle.

2. Calculate the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons:
   * Bologna thrown at red balloons = 2 pieces per balloon × 20 red balloons
