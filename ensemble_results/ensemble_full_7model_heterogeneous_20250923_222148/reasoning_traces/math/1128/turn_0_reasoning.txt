=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Vince's current age based on the information given about Liam's age.

1. **Identify Liam's current age**: 
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.

2. **Determine Liam's age two years ago**: 
   - Two years ago, Liam's age would have been:
     \[
     16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Liam's age and Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let \( V \) represent Vince's age two years ago. The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     14 = 2V
     \]

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - To find \( V \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - Therefore, Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

5. **Determine Vince's current age**: 
   - Since two years have passed since then, we add 2 years to Vince's age two years ago:
     \[
     7 + 2 = 9
     \]

Thus, Vince is currently **9 years old**.

**Final Answer**: Vince is 9 years old now.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Vince's current age based on the given information about Liam's age.

Given information:
- Liam is 16 years old now.
- Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.

Step 1: Find Liam's age two years ago.
Liam's age two years ago = Liam's current age - 2 years
Liam's age two years ago = 16 - 2 = 14 years

Step 2: Find Vince's age two years ago.
Since Liam's age two years ago was twice the age of Vince, we...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Vince's current age based on the information given about Liam's and Vince's ages.

1. **Identify the current age of Liam:**
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.

2. **Determine Liam's age two years ago:**
   - Since Liam is 16 now, two years ago he was:
     \[
     16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Use the information about Vince's age two years ago:**
   - Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Theref...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Liam is 16 years old now
* Two years ago, Liam's age was twice Vince's age

2. Let's find Liam's age two years ago:
* Liam's age 2 years ago = Current age - 2
* Liam's age 2 years ago = 16 - 2 = 14

3. We know that Liam's age two years ago was twice Vince's age then
* Liam's age 2 years ago = 2 × Vince's age 2 years ago
* 14 = 2 × Vince's age 2 years ago
* Vince's age 2 years...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine Liam's age two years ago.
Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Step 2: Determine Vince's age two years ago.
Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Therefore, Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

Step 3: Determine Vince's current age.
Two years have passed since Vince was 7 years old, so Vince is now 7 + 2 = 9 years old.

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to set up an equation and solve for Vince's current age.

Given:
- Liam is 16 years old now.
- Two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince.

Step 1: Let's express Liam's age two years ago.
Liam's age two years ago = Liam's current age - 2
Liam's age two years ago = 16 - 2 = 14

Step 2: Express Vince's age two years ago in terms of Liam's age at that time.
Vince's age ...
