=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Adam contributed from his savings after receiving money from his mother and father.

1. **Identify the total cost of the trousers**: 
   Adam bought trousers for $30.

2. **Calculate the amount given by his mother**: 
   Adam's mother gave him $6.

3. **Calculate the amount given by his father**: 
   Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount from father} = 2 \times \text{Amount from mother} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]
   So, Adam's father gave him $12.

4. **Calculate the total amount Adam received from his parents**: 
   We add the amounts from his mother and father:
   \[
   \text{Total from parents} = \text{Amount from mother} + \text{Amount from father} = 6 + 12 = 18
   \]

5. **Determine how much Adam contributed from his savings**: 
   To find out how much Adam had to contribute, we subtract the total amount he received from his parents from the total cost of the trousers:
   \[
   \text{Amount contributed by Adam} = \text{Cost of trousers} - \text{Total from parents} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

Thus, Adam had to contribute **$12** from his savings.

Final answer: Adam contributed **$12** from his savings.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the known values:
* Total cost of trousers = $30
* Mother's contribution = $6
* Father's contribution = 2 × Mother's contribution

2. Calculate father's contribution:
* Father's contribution = 2 × $6
* Father's contribution = $12

3. Calculate total contributions from parents:
* Total parent contribution = Mother's contribution + Father's contribution
* Total parent contribution = $6 + $12
*...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since it's stated that his father gave him twice as much as his mother, and his mother gave him $6, we multiply 6 by 2 to find out the amount his father gave him. 

6 * 2 = $12

So, Adam's father gave him $12. 

Next, we add the amount his mother gave him to the amount his father gave him to find out the total amount of money Adam received from his parents. 

6 (from his mother) + 12 (from his father) = $18

So,...
