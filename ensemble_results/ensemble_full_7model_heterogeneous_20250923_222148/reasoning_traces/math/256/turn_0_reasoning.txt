Final Answer: To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we need to calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum those values.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - The value of one penny is $0.01.
   - Therefore, the total value of the pennies is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - The value of one nickel is $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:
     \[
     40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - The value of one dime is $0.10.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - The value of one dollar bill is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dollar bills is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollars/bill} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Sum all the values:**
   - Now, we add the total values of all the coins and bills:
     \[
     1.00 \text{ (pennies)} + 2.00 \text{ (nickels)} + 2.00 \text{ (dimes)} + 40.00 \text{ (dollar bills)} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is:

\[
\boxed{45.00} \text{ dollars}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's calculate the value of each type of coin/bill:

   Pennies:
   * 1 penny = $0.01
   * 100 pennies = 100 × $0.01 = $1.00

   Nickels:
   * 1 nickel = $0.05
   * 40 nickels = 40 × $0.05 = $2.00

   Dimes:
   * 1 dime = $0.10
   * 20 dimes = 20 × $0.10 = $2.00

   Dollar bills:
   * 1 dollar bill = $1.00
   * 40 dollar bills = 40 × $1.00 = $40.00

2. Now add all amounts:
   * $1.00 (pennies)
   * $2.00 (nickel...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert all the coins and bills to dollars.

1 penny is worth $0.01, so 100 pennies are worth 100 * $0.01 = $1.

1 nickel is worth $0.05, so 40 nickels are worth 40 * $0.05 = $2.

1 dime is worth $0.10, so 20 dimes are worth 20 * $0.10 = $2.

1 dollar bill is worth $1, so 40 dollar bills are worth 40 * $1 = $40.

Now, we add up all the amounts to find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank.

$1 (from pennies) + $2 (from nickels) + $2 (from...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's count the total value of the pennies:
   * There are 100 pennies.
   * Each penny is worth 1 cent, or $0.01.
   * Total value of pennies = 100 × $0.01 = $1.00

2. Next, let's count the total value of the nickels:
   * There are 40 nickels.
   * Each nickel is worth 5 cents, or $0.05.
   * Total value of nickels = 40 × $0.05 = $2.00

3. Now, let's count the total value of the dimes:
   * There a...
