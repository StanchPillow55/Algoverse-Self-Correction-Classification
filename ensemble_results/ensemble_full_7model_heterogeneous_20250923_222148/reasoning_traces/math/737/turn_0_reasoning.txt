Final Answer: To determine how many ounces of water Peter has left after making the ice cubes, we will first calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the initial amount of water he has.

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = Number of giant cubes × Water per giant cube
   \[
   \text{Total for giant cubes} = 3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces/cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the water used for medium cubes:**
   - Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 7 medium cubes.
   - Total water used for medium cubes = Number of medium cubes × Water per medium cube
   \[
   \text{Total for medium cubes} = 7 \text{ cubes} \times 2 \text{ ounces/cube} = 14 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the water used for small cubes:**
   - Each small cube uses 1/2 ounce of water.
   - Peter makes 8 small cubes.
   - Total water used for small cubes = Number of small cubes × Water per small cube
   \[
   \text{Total for small cubes} = 8 \text{ cubes} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ ounce/cube} = 4 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total water used:**
   - Now we will sum the water used for all types of cubes:
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = \text{Total for giant cubes} + \text{Total for medium cubes} + \text{Total for small cubes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 12 \text{ ounces} + 14 \text{ ounces} + 4 \text{ ounces} = 30 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining water:**
   - Peter started with 32 ounces of water. To find out how much water he has left, we subtract the total water used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Total water used}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 32 \text{ ounces} - 30 \text{ ounces} = 2 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, after making the ice cubes, Peter has **2 ounces of water left**.

Final answer: **2 ounces**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter has 32 ounces of water.
- He can make:
  - Giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube
  - Medium cubes that use 2 ounces per cube
  - Small cubes that use 1/2 ounce per cube
- He makes:
  - 3 giant cubes
  - 7 medium cubes
  - 8 small cubes

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water used for the giant cubes.
Water used for giant cubes = 3 cubes × 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces

Step 2: Calc...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used to make the ice cubes and then subtract this from the total amount of water Peter has, which is 32 ounces.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the water used for giant cubes:**
   - Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.
   - Peter makes 3 giant cubes.
   - Total water used for giant cubes = \(3 \text{ cubes} \times 4 \text{ ounces per cube} = 12 \text{ ounces}\).

2. **Ca...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Peter has 32 ounces of water total
* Giant cubes = 4 ounces each
* Medium cubes = 2 ounces each
* Small cubes = 1/2 ounce each
* He makes 3 giant, 7 medium, and 8 small cubes

2. Calculate water used for giant cubes:
* 3 giant cubes × 4 ounces = 12 ounces

3. Calculate water used for medium cubes:
* 7 medium cubes × 2 ounces = 14 ounces

4. Calculate water used for small cube...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how many ounces of water Peter used to make each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes, he made 3 cubes and each cube uses 4 ounces of water. So, he used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 ounces of water for the giant cubes.

For the medium cubes, he made 7 cubes and each cube uses 2 ounces of water. So, he used 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 ounces of water for the medium cubes.

For the small cubes, he made 8 cubes and each cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water. So, he ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Peter has 32 ounces of water in total.
   * Giant cubes use 4 ounces of water per cube.
   * Medium cubes use 2 ounces of water per cube.
   * Small cubes use 1/2 ounce of water per cube.
   * Peter makes 3 giant cubes, 7 medium cubes, and 8 small cubes.

2. Calculate the amount of water used for giant cubes:
   * Water used for giant cubes = 4 ounces × 3 cubes
