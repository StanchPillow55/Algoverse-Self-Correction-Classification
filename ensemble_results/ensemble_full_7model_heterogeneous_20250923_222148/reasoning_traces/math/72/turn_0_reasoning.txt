Final Answer: To determine how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to calculate the total income from each type of dessert and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the income from brownies:**
   - Tommy sells brownies for $3 each.
   - He sells a total of 43 brownies.
   - The income from brownies can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Income from brownies} = \text{Number of brownies} \times \text{Price per brownie}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Income from brownies} = 43 \times 3
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     43 \times 3 = 129
     \]
   - So, Tommy raises **$129** from selling brownies.

2. **Calculate the income from cheesecakes:**
   - Tommy sells cheesecakes for $4 each.
   - He sells a total of 23 slices of cheesecake.
   - The income from cheesecakes can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Income from cheesecakes} = \text{Number of cheesecakes} \times \text{Price per cheesecake}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Income from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     23 \times 4 = 92
     \]
   - So, Tommy raises **$92** from selling cheesecakes.

3. **Calculate the total income:**
   - To find the total amount of money Tommy raises, we add the income from brownies and cheesecakes:
     \[
     \text{Total income} = \text{Income from brownies} + \text{Income from cheesecakes}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total income} = 129 + 92
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     129 + 92 = 221
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes is **$221**.
