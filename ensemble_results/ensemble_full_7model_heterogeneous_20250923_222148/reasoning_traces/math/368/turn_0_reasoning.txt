=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before she scored 14 points. 

Let's denote:
- \( E \) as the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.
- \( S \) as the number of points Sara has, which is given as 8 points.

According to the problem, after Erin scores 14 points, her total points become \( E + 14 \). We are also told that after scoring these points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. 

We can express this relationship mathematically:

\[
E + 14 = 3S
\]

Substituting the value of \( S \) (which is 8) into the equation:

\[
E + 14 = 3 \times 8
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now we can rewrite the equation:

\[
E + 14 = 24
\]

To find \( E \), we need to isolate it by subtracting 14 from both sides:

\[
E = 24 - 14
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
E = 10
\]

Thus, Erin had **10 points** before scoring 14 points.

To summarize:
- Erin had 10 points before.
- After scoring 14 points, her total becomes \( 10 + 14 = 24 \).
- Sara has 8 points, and indeed \( 24 = 3 \times 8 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points.

Given information:
- Erin scored 14 points.
- After scoring 14 points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Step 1: Find the total number of points Erin has after scoring 14 points.
Erin's total points = 3 × Sara's points
Erin's total points = 3 × 8 = 24 points

Step 2: Find the number of points Erin had before scoring 14 po...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points. We know that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Sara's Points:**
   Sara scored 8 points.

2. **Determine Erin's Points After Scoring 14:**
   We are told that after scoring 14 points, Erin has three times more points than Sara. This means Erin's total points after ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Erin scored 14 points in this game
* After scoring these points, Erin has three times more points than Sara
* Sara scored 8 points
* We need to find Erin's points before the game

2. Let's find Sara's total points:
* Sara scored 8 points
* So Sara's total points = 8

3. We know that after scoring, Erin has three times Sara's points:
* Erin's current points = 3 × Sara's points
* Erin...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8. This means Erin now has 3 * 8 = <<3*8=24>>24 points.

However, Erin scored 14 points to get to this total. So, to find out how many points Erin had before, we need to subtract the points she just scored from her current total.

So, Erin had 24 - 14 = <<24-14=10>>10 points before she scored the 14 points.

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Erin scored 14 points in the recent game.
   * After scoring these points, Erin now has three times more points than Sara.
   * Sara scored 8 points.

2. Find the total points Sara has:
   * Sara's total points = 8
   * We don't need to do any calculations here since the problem directly states that Sara scored 8 points.

3. Find the total points Erin has after s...
