=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of the 50 books in the library are written in Spanish.

1. **Identify the total number of books**: 
   The total number of books in the library is given as 50.

2. **Calculate the number of English books**: 
   We know that half of the books are written in English. 
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of German books**: 
   We are told that 10% of the books are written in German. 
   To find 10% of 50, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of Spanish books**: 
   Now, we can find the number of Spanish books by subtracting the number of English and German books from the total number of books.
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = \text{Total books} - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books})
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of Spanish books in the library is \( \boxed{20} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many books are written in English and German.

We know that half of the books are written in English. Since there are 50 books in total, the number of English books is 50/2 = 25 books.

Next, we know that 10% of the books are written in German. To find out how many that is, we multiply the total number of books by 10% (or 0.10). So, the number of German books is 50 * 0.10 = 5 books.

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subt...
