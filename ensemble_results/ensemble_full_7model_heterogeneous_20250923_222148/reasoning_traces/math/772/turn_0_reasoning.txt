=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Weekend Hours**: 
   Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. 
   \[
   \text{Total Weekend Hours} = 7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate Time Spent Reading**: 
   Tatiana reads for 3 hours.
   \[
   \text{Time Spent Reading} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate Remaining Time After Reading**: 
   We subtract the time spent reading from the total weekend hours.
   \[
   \text{Remaining Time} = \text{Total Weekend Hours} - \text{Time Spent Reading} = 12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate Time Spent Playing Video Games**: 
   Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time.
   \[
   \text{Time Spent Playing Video Games} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining Time} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculate Time Spent Playing Soccer**: 
   We now find the time spent playing soccer by subtracting the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend hours.
   \[
   \text{Time Spent Playing Soccer} = \text{Total Weekend Hours} - (\text{Time Spent Reading} + \text{Time Spent Playing Video Games})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time Spent Playing Soccer} = 12 - (3 + 3) = 12 - 6 = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Percentage of Weekend Spent Playing Soccer**: 
   To find the percentage of the weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Weekend Playing Soccer} = \left( \frac{\text{Time Spent Playing Soccer}}{\text{Total Weekend Hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage of Weekend Playing Soccer} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, Tatiana spends **50%** of her weekend playing soccer.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours over the weekend.
- She spends 3 hours reading.
- She spends 1/3 of the remaining time playing video games.

Step 1: Calculate the remaining time after reading.
Total time - Time spent reading = Remaining time
12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

Step 2: Calculate the time spent playing video games.
Remaining time × 1...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Tatiana spends playing soccer over the weekend and then express that time as a percentage of her total available time.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Available Time
Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday. Therefore, her total available time over the weekend is:

\[
7 \text{ hours (Saturday)} + 5 \text{ hours (Sunday)} = 12 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Time Spent Reading
Tatiana spends 3 hou...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total hours in Tatiana's weekend:
   * Saturday hours = 7
   * Sunday hours = 5
   * Total weekend hours = 7 + 5 = 12 hours

2. We know she reads for 3 hours
   * Remaining hours after reading = 12 - 3 = 9 hours

3. She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time
   * Video game hours = 1/3 × 9 = 3 hours

4. The rest of the time is spent playing soccer
   * Soccer hours = Remaining hours...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which gives her a total of 7 + 5 = 12 hours for the weekend.

She spends 3 hours reading, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left for soccer and video games.

She spends 1/3 of this time playing video games, which is 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours.

This leaves her with 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we need to divide the time she spends playing soccer by the ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tatiana has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so her total weekend time is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.
   * She spends 3 hours reading.
   * She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time after reading.
   * We need to find the percentage of time she spends playing soccer.

2. Calculate the time remaining after reading:
   * Remaining time = Total time - Reading ti...
