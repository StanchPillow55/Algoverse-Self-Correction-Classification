=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of surfers who can stay upright on the wave, and then determine how many of those are men.

1. **Determine the number of surfers who can stay upright**:
   - We know that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
   - There are 100 riders in total.

   \[
   \text{Number of surfers who can stay upright} = 25\% \text{ of } 100
   \]

   To calculate 25% of 100, we can convert the percentage to a decimal:

   \[
   25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25
   \]

   Now, we multiply this by the total number of riders:

   \[
   \text{Number of surfers who can stay upright} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of women who can stay upright**:
   - Of the surfers who can stay upright, 60% are women.

   \[
   \text{Number of women who can stay upright} = 60\% \text{ of } 25
   \]

   Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

   \[
   60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.60
   \]

   Now, we multiply this by the number of surfers who can stay upright:

   \[
   \text{Number of women who can stay upright} = 0.60 \times 25 = 15
   \]

3. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright**:
   - To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women from the total number of surfers who can stay upright.

   \[
   \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = \text{Total surfers who can stay upright} - \text{Number of women who can stay upright}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Number of men who can stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]

This means that 10 men can stay upright on the wave.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- When a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
- Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women.
- There are 100 riders in total.

Step 1: Find the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.
25% of 100 riders = 0.25 × 100 = 25 riders can stay upright

Step 2: Find the number of women who can stay upright on the wave.
60% of 25 riders = 0.60 ×...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many men can stay upright on a big wave that is over 30 feet tall, given the information about the percentage of riders who can stay upright and the gender distribution among those who can.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of riders who can stay upright:**

   We know that only 25% of the riders can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet. If there are 100 riders in total, we calculat...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total number of riders = 100
* 25% of riders can stay upright on waves over 30 feet
* Of those who stay upright, 60% are women

2. Calculate how many total riders can stay upright:
* 25% of 100 = 100 × 0.25 = 25 riders can stay upright

3. Of those who stay upright, find how many are women:
* 60% of 25 = 25 × 0.60 = 15 women can stay upright

4. To find the number of m...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. We know that 25% of the riders can stay upright. Since there are 100 riders, we calculate 25% of 100:

100 * 0.25 = 25 riders

So, 25 riders can stay upright on the wave.

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women. This means that the remaining 40% are men. We calculate 40% of 25:

25 * 0.40 = 10 ride...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the solution.

Given:
- When a wave is over 30 feet, only 25% of the riders can stay upright.
- Among the riders who stay upright, 60% are women.
- There are a total of 100 riders.

Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright on a wave over 30 feet.
