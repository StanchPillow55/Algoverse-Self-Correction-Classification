=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then determine how many windows Hannah smashes based on the given fractions.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows for students' cars.

1. **Number of students' cars**: 64
2. **Number of windows per student car**: 4

To find the total number of windows for students' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for students' cars} = \text{Number of students' cars} \times \text{Number of windows per car}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows for students' cars} = 64 \times 4 = 256
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of windows for teachers' cars.

1. **Number of teachers' cars**: 32
2. **Number of windows per teacher car**: 2

To find the total number of windows for teachers' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for teachers' cars} = \text{Number of teachers' cars} \times \text{Number of windows per car}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows for teachers' cars} = 32 \times 2 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

1. **Windows smashed from students' cars**: Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows.
   - Total windows for students' cars: 256
   - Windows smashed: 

\[
\text{Windows smashed from students' cars} = \frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64
\]

2. **Windows smashed from teachers' cars**: Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.
   - Total windows for teachers' cars: 64
   - Windows smashed:

\[
\text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars} = \frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of windows smashed.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from both students' and teachers' cars:

\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = \text{Windows smashed from students' cars} + \text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars}
\]
\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = 64 + 48 = 112
\]

### Final Answer

Hannah smashes a total of **112 windows**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars.
Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars × 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of windows in students' cars:
* 64 cars × 4 windows per car = 256 total student car windows

2. Calculate how many student car windows Hannah smashes:
* She smashes 1/4 of student windows
* 256 × (1/4) = 64 student car windows smashed

3. Calculate total number of windows in teachers' cars:
* 32 cars × 2 windows per car = 64 total teacher car windows

4. Calculate how many ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how many windows there are in total for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

For the students' cars, there are 64 cars and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 * 4 = 256 windows.

For the teachers' cars, there are 32 cars and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 * 2 = 64 windows.

Now, let's calculate how many windows Hannah smashes.
