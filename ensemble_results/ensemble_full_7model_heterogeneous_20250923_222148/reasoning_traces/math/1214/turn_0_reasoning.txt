=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children:**
   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Since Jordan has 2 children, we multiply the number of children by the number of diaper changes per child:
     \[
     \text{Total diaper changes} = 2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ diaper changes/child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes}
     \]

2. **Determine how many diapers Jordan's wife changes:**
   - It is stated that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.
   - To find out how many diapers she changes, we take half of the total diaper changes:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by wife} = \frac{10 \text{ diaper changes}}{2} = 5 \text{ diaper changes}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many diapers Jordan changes:**
   - Since the total number of diaper changes is 10 and his wife changes 5 of them, we can find out how many diapers Jordan changes by subtracting the number of diapers changed by his wife from the total:
     \[
     \text{Diapers changed by Jordan} = 10 \text{ diaper changes} - 5 \text{ diaper changes} = 5 \text{ diaper changes}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of diapers that Jordan changes per day is:
     \[
     \boxed{5}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.
- Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
- Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of diaper changes per day for both children.
Total diaper changes per day = 2 children × 5 diaper changes per child per day = 10 diaper changes per day

Step 2: Calculate the number of diaper changes that Jordan's ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day given the information provided.

1. **Determine the total number of diaper changes needed per day for both children:**

   - Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   - Jordan has 2 children.

   Therefore, the total number of diaper changes per day for both children is calculated as follows:

   \[
   5 \text{ diaper changes/child/day} \times 2 \text{ children} = 10 \text{ diaper ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day:
* 2 children × 5 diaper changes each
* 2 × 5 = 10 total diaper changes per day

2. Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers:
* Half of 10 = 10 ÷ 2 = 5 diaper changes

3. Therefore, Jordan changes the other half:
* Jordan changes 5 diapers per day

Reasoning:
- With 2 children needing 5 changes each, that's 10 total changes
- The work is sp...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many diapers are used in total per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and there are 2 children, we multiply 5 by 2. 

5 diapers/child/day * 2 children = 10 diapers/day

Next, we know that Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers. Therefore, Jordan also changes the other half. To find out how many diapers Jordan changes, we divide the total number of diapers by 2.

10 diapers/day ÷ 2 = 5 diapers/day

So, Jordan changes 5...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers.
   * Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day.
   * Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.

2. Calculate the total number of diaper changes needed per day:
   * Number of children = 2
   * Diaper changes per child per day = 5
   * Total diaper changes per day = Number of children × Diaper changes per child per day
   * To...
