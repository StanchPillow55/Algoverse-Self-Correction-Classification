=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people John lost to after arm wrestling 20 people, given that he beats 80% of them.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of people John beat

First, we need to find out how many people John won against. Since he beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestled, we can calculate the number of people he beat as follows:

\[
\text{Number of people beaten} = \text{Total people} \times \text{Percentage beaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of people beaten} = 20 \times 0.80
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people beaten} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people John lost to

Next, we need to determine how many people John lost to. Since he arm wrestled a total of 20 people and he beat 16 of them, we can find the number of people he lost to by subtracting the number of people he beat from the total number of people:

\[
\text{Number of people lost to} = \text{Total people} - \text{Number of people beaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of people lost to} = 20 - 16
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people lost to} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

John lost to **4 people**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of people John lost to in the arm wrestling matches.

Given information:
- John arm wrestles 20 people.
- He beats 80% of the people.

Step 1: Find the number of people John beat.
80% of 20 people = 0.80 × 20 = 16 people

Step 2: Find the number of people John lost to.
Total number of people John arm wrestled = 20
Number of people John beat = 16
Number of people John lost to = Total number of people - ...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people John lost to in his arm wrestling matches.

1. **Understand the problem:**  
   John arm wrestles a total of 20 people. He beats 80% of them. We need to find out how many people he lost to.

2. **Calculate the number of people John beat:**  
   Since John beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles, we first calculate 80% of 20.

   \[
   \text{Number of people John beat} = 80\% \times 20
   \]

   To find 80% of 20...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* John wrestled 20 people total
* He won 80% of the matches

2. To find how many people he lost to:
* First calculate how many people he beat
* Then subtract that from total matches

3. Calculate number of wins:
* 80% = 0.80
* 20 people × 0.80 = 16 people he beat

4. Calculate number of losses:
* Total matches - Wins = Losses
* 20 - 16 = 4 losses

Therefore, John lost to 4 peop...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many people John beat in arm wrestling. We know he beat 80% of the people he arm wrestled. 

To find out how many people that is, we multiply the total number of people he arm wrestled by the percentage he beat. 

So, 20 (total people) * 0.80 (percentage he beat) = 16 people.

This means John beat 16 people in arm wrestling.

Next, we need to find out how many people John lost to. We do this by subtracting the number of people he beat from t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John arm wrestles 20 people in total.
   * He beats 80% of the people he arm wrestles.

2. Calculate the number of people John beats:
   * John beats 80% of 20 people.
   * To find 80% of 20, we multiply 20 by 0.80 (which is 80% expressed as a decimal).
   * 20 × 0.80 = 16
   * So, John beats 16 people.

3. Calculate the number of people John loses to:
   * Since...
