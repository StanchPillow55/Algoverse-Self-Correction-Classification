=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the number of books each person has.

Let:
- \( S \) = number of books Sofie has
- \( A \) = number of books Anne has
- \( F \) = number of books Fawn has

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books:
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
A = F - 12
\]
Substituting this into the equation for \( S \):
\[
S = (F - 12) + 25
\]
Simplifying this gives:
\[
S = F + 13
\]

Now we have expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) in terms of \( F \):
- \( S = F + 13 \)
- \( A = F - 12 \)

Next, we substitute these expressions into the total books equation:
\[
(F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
\]
\[
3F + 1 = 85
\]

Now, subtract 1 from both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Next, divide both sides by 3:
\[
F = 28
\]

Now that we have found \( F \), we can also find \( A \) and \( S \) if needed:
\[
A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16
\]
\[
S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41
\]

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

Everything checks out, so the number of books Fawn has is:
\[
\boxed{28}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.

Step 1: Let's represent the number of books each person has with variables.
Let's say:
- Sofie has x books
- Anne has x - 25 books
- Fawn has x - 12 books

Step 2: Set up an equation to represent the total number of books.
Total books = Sofie's books + Anne's b...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the unknowns. Let's define the variables and translate the problem into mathematical equations.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
   - Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - We know from the problem that together, Sofie,...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define variables:
   * Let f = Fawn's books
   * Let a = Anne's books
   * Let s = Sofie's books

2) We know:
   * Total books = 85
   * Sofie has 25 more than Anne: s = a + 25
   * Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn: a = f - 12

3) Using these relationships:
   * Total: f + a + s = 85
   * Substitute s = a + 25: f + a + (a + 25) = 85
   * Simplify: f + 2a + 25 = 85

4) We also know a = f - 12
   * Substitute a = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of books each person has as follows:

Sofie = S
Anne = A
Fawn = F

From the problem, we know that:

S + A + F = 85 (equation 1)

We also know that:

S = A + 25 (equation 2)

And:

A = F - 12 (equation 3)

We can substitute equation 2 and equation 3 into equation 1 to solve for F:

(A + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85
A + F + 13 + F = 85
2F + A = 72

Substitute equation 3 into the above equation:

2F + (F - 12) = 72
3F - 12 = 72
3F = 84
F = 84 / 3
F = 28

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find out how many books Fawn has, given the total number of books and the relationships between the number of books each person has.

Given:
- Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have a total of 85 books.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.
