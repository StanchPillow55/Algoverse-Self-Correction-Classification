=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire day.**
2. **Add up the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon.**
3. **Subtract the total amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement to find out how much is needed for the final meal.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire day

Wendi has 20 chickens, and each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Therefore, the total daily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total daily feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Cups of feed per chicken}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total daily feed} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Add up the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon

Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon. We can calculate the total feed given in these two meals:

\[
\text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = \text{Morning feed} + \text{Afternoon feed}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total feed given} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal

Now, we need to find out how much feed is left for the final meal of the day. We do this by subtracting the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed requirement:

\[
\text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total daily feed} - \text{Total feed given}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Feed needed for final meal} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
\]

### Final Answer

Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of feed required for the flock of 20 chickens and then subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals.

Given information:
- Each chicken is fed 3 cups of mixed chicken feed per day.
- In the morning, Wendi gives her flock 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, Wendi gives her flock 25 cups of feed.
- The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.

First, let's calculate the total amount of feed Wendi needs to give to her chickens each day. We know that each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we can calculate the total daily feed requirement as follows:

\[
\text{Total daily feed} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken per day}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day
* Wendi has 20 chickens
* Feed is given in 3 meals
* Morning meal = 15 cups
* Afternoon meal = 25 cups
* Need to find the final meal amount

2. Calculate total daily feed needed:
* Daily feed per chicken = 3 cups
* Number of chickens = 20
* Total daily feed = 3 Ã— 20 = 60 cups

3. Calculate how much feed has already been given:

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in total each day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per day and Wendi has 20 chickens, we multiply 3 cups/chicken * 20 chickens = 60 cups of feed in total each day.

Next, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi has already given her chickens. We know she gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups of feed already given.

Finally, to...
