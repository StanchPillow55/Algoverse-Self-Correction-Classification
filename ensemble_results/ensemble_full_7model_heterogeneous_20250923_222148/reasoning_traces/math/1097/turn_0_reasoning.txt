=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many people were inside the church, we need to calculate the total number of people transported by the buses and cars.

1. **Calculate the number of people transported by the buses:**
   - There are 12 buses.
   - Each bus carries 35 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people transported by the buses can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total people from buses} = \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus} = 12 \times 35
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     12 \times 35 = 420
     \]
   - So, 420 people were transported by the buses.

2. **Calculate the number of people transported by the cars:**
   - There are 20 private cars.
   - Each car carries 3 people.
   - Therefore, the total number of people transported by the cars can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total people from cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car} = 20 \times 3
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60
     \]
   - So, 60 people were transported by the cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of people inside the church:**
   - To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the number of people transported by the buses and the number of people transported by the cars:
     \[
     \text{Total people inside the church} = \text{Total people from buses} + \text{Total people from cars} = 420 + 60
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     420 + 60 = 480
     \]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is **480**.

Final answer: **480**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of people who were inside the church.

Given information:
- There were 20 private cars and 12 buses parked outside the church.
- Each bus carried 35 people.
- Each car carried 3 people.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people carried by the buses.
Number of buses × Number of people per bus = Total number of people carried by buses
12 buses × 35 people per bus = 420 people

Step 2: Calculate the n...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people who were inside the church based on the transportation available after the ceremony.

1. **Identify the number of vehicles and their capacities:**
   - There are 20 private cars.
   - There are 12 buses.
   - Each car carries 3 people.
   - Each bus carries 35 people.

2. **Calculate the total number of people transported by the cars:**
   - Each car carries 3 people, and there are 20 cars.
   - Total...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* There were 20 private cars
* There were 12 buses
* Each bus carried 35 people
* Each car carried 3 people

2. Let's calculate how many people were in the cars:
* People in cars = Number of cars × People per car
* People in cars = 20 × 3 = 60 people

3. Let's calculate how many people were in the buses:
* People in buses = Number of buses × People per bus
* People in buses = 1...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of people that each type of vehicle can carry is found by multiplying the number of vehicles by the number of people each vehicle can carry.

For the cars, this is 20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people.

For the buses, this is 12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people.

Adding these two totals together gives the total number of people at the wedding.

So, 60 people + 420 people = 480 people.

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church.
