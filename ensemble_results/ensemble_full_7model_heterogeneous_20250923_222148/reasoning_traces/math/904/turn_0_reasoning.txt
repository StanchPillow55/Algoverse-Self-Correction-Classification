Final Answer: To find the average price Deepa paid per ticket, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of tickets Deepa purchased.**
   - There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
   - Deepa has seen each movie 3 times.
   - Therefore, the total number of tickets she purchased is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total tickets} = \text{Number of movies} \times \text{Number of times seen each movie}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tickets} = 9 \times 3 = 27
     \]

2. **Calculate the average price per ticket.**
   - We know that Deepa spent a total of $216 on tickets.
   - To find the average price per ticket, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of tickets purchased:
     \[
     \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total tickets}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{216}{27}
     \]

3. **Perform the division.**
   - Now we calculate \( \frac{216}{27} \):
     \[
     216 \div 27 = 8
     \]

Thus, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is \( \boxed{8} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times. So, the total number of times she has seen these movies is 9 movies * 3 times = 27 times.

She has spent a total of $216 to see these movies. To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of times she saw the movies.

So, the average price per ticket is $216 / 27 = $8.

Therefore, Deepa paid an average of $8 per ticket to see the Fast and...
