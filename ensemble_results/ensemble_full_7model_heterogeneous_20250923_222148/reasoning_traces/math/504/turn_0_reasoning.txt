=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum that Suzie bought. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the packs of gum Suzie bought:**
   - She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
   - She bought 1 pack of grape gum.
   - She bought 1 pack of green apple gum.

2. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
   - The cost of the grape gum is given as $2.
   - The cost of the green apple gum is half the cost of the grape gum, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) dollar.

3. **Set up the equation based on the total cost:**
   - The total cost of all the packs of gum is $7.
   - Therefore, we can express the total cost as:
   \[
   2x + 2 + 1 = 7
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Combine the constant costs:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 7
   \]

5. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 7 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 4
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The cost of each pack of strawberry gum is \( x = 2 \) dollars.

Thus, the final answer is that each pack of strawberry gum costs **$2**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total
- 2 packs were strawberry flavor
- 1 pack was grape flavor, costing $2
- 1 pack was green apple flavor, costing half as much as the grape flavor

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the grape and green apple gum
2. Subtract that from the total amount Suzie paid ($7)
3. Divide the remaining amount ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each pack of strawberry gum. Let's break down the information given and set up an equation to find the solution.

1. **Identify the variables and known values:**
   - Let \( x \) be the cost of one pack of strawberry gum.
   - Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for strawberry gum is \( 2x \).
   - The cost of the grape gum pack is $2.
   - The cost of the green apple gum pack is half the cos...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Suzie bought 4 packs total
* 2 packs were strawberry (same price each)
* 1 pack was grape that cost $2
* 1 pack was green apple that cost half of grape ($1)
* Total spent was $7

2. Let's find the cost of green apple:
* Green apple costs half of grape
* Grape costs $2
* So green apple costs: $2 รท 2 = $1

3. Let's set up what we know about the total:
* Total = (2 ร Strawberry price) ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the cost of a pack of strawberry gum as S. We know that Suzie bought two packs of strawberry gum, so the total cost for the strawberry gum is 2S.

We also know that Suzie bought a pack of grape gum for $2 and a pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum, which is $2/2 = $1.

The total cost for all the gum Suzie bought is $7. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

2S (strawberry) + $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum.

Given:
- Suzie bought four packs of gum.
- Two packs were strawberry flavor (her favorite).
- One pack of grape gum cost $2.
- One small pack of green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum.
- Suzie paid a total of $7 for all four p...
