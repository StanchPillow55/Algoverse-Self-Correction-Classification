Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet during the 5 minutes of dancing, taking into account the different tap rates for when her arms are raised and when they are not.

### Step 1: Calculate the taps when arms are raised

When Helga raises her arms, she taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute. Since she has her arms raised for 2 minutes, we can calculate the total taps for both feet during this time.

- **Taps per foot with arms raised**: 200 taps/minute
- **Duration with arms raised**: 2 minutes

Total taps for one foot when arms are raised:
\[
\text{Total taps (one foot)} = \text{Taps per foot} \times \text{Duration} = 200 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 2 \, \text{minutes} = 400 \, \text{taps}
\]

Since she taps both feet, we multiply this by 2:
\[
\text{Total taps (both feet)} = 400 \, \text{taps} \times 2 = 800 \, \text{taps}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the taps when arms are not raised

When Helga has her arms at her sides, she taps her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute. The total tap rate for both feet is the sum of the taps from each foot.

- **Taps per minute for right foot**: 300 taps/minute
- **Taps per minute for left foot**: 250 taps/minute
- **Total taps per minute (both feet)**: 
\[
\text{Total taps per minute} = 300 + 250 = 550 \, \text{taps/minute}
\]

Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, but she has her arms raised for 2 minutes. Therefore, the time with her arms at her sides is:
\[
\text{Time with arms at sides} = 5 \, \text{minutes} - 2 \, \text{minutes} = 3 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Now we can calculate the total taps for both feet during the 3 minutes with her arms at her sides:
\[
\text{Total taps (both feet)} = \text{Total taps per minute} \times \text{Duration} = 550 \, \text{taps/minute} \times 3 \, \text{minutes} = 1650 \, \text{taps}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the total taps

Now we can find the combined total number of taps for both scenarios:
\[
\text{Combined total taps} = \text{Taps with arms raised} + \text{Taps with arms at sides} = 800 \, \text{taps} + 1650 \, \text{taps} = 2450 \, \text{taps}
\]

### Final Answer

The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes of dancing is:
\[
\boxed{2450}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Helga can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- Helga can tap her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute with her arms at her sides.
- When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.
- Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes.
- Helga has her arms raised for 2 of those 5 minutes.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet during the 5-minute dance, considering the different rates when her arms are raised and when they are not.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Determine the tap rates:**
   - With arms down:
     - Right foot: 300 taps per minute
     - Left foot: 250 taps per minute
   - With arms raised:
     - Both feet: 200 taps per minute each

2. **Calculate the number of taps with arms...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's identify the two different rates:
   * With arms down: Right foot = 300 taps/min, Left foot = 250 taps/min
   * With arms raised: Both feet = 200 taps/min each

2) Let's break down the 5 minutes:
   * 2 minutes with arms raised
   * 3 minutes with arms down

3) Calculate taps during arms raised (2 minutes):
   * Right foot: 200 taps/min × 2 min = 400 taps
   * Left foot: 200 taps/min × 2 min = 400 ta...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga can do with both hands at her sides. 

She can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. Therefore, when she has both hands at her sides, she can tap a total of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

Helga dances with her hands at her sides for a total of 5 - 2 = 3 minutes (since she raises her arms for 2 minutes out of the total 5 minutes).

Therefore, the total numbe...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Helga can tap her right foot at 300 taps per minute and her left foot at 250 taps per minute when her arms are at her sides.
   * When Helga raises her arms, her tap rate slows down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.
   * Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised for 2 minutes.

2. Calculate the number of taps for each foot when her arms a...
