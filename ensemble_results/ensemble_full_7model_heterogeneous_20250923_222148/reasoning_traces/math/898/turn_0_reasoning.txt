=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the distance that Anis rowed based on the distance that Dijana rowed, and then find the total distance both of them rowed together.

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: 
   According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. We need to calculate how much that is.

   First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of Dijana's distance:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]

   Now, since Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more than Dijana, we add this to Dijana's distance to find Anis's total distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = \text{Distance rowed by Dijana} + \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Distance rowed by Dijana}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance rowed by both**: 
   Now we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance rowed by Dijana} + \text{Distance rowed by Anis}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is \( \boxed{110} \) miles.

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the distance that Anis rowed based on the distance that Dijana rowed, and then find the total distance both of them rowed together.

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: 
   According to the problem, Anis rowed \( \frac{1}{5} \) times more miles than Dijana. We need to calculate how much that is.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Dijana rowed for 50 miles the whole day.
- Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.
Anis's miles = Dijana's miles + (1/5 × Dijana's miles)
Anis's miles = 50 + (1/5 × 50)
Anis's miles = 50 + 10
Anis's miles = 60 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance the two of them rowed.
Total distan...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day.

1. **Determine the distance Dijana rowed:**
   - We are given that Dijana rowed 50 miles.

2. **Determine the distance Anis rowed:**
   - Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. This means Anis rowed an additional 1/5 of the distance Dijana rowed.
   - First, calculate 1/5 of the distance Dijana rowed:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Dijana rowed 50 miles
* Anis rowed 1/5 (or 20%) more miles than Dijana

2. Let's calculate how far Anis rowed:
* To find 1/5 more than 50:
  * 1/5 of 50 = 50 ÷ 5 = 10 miles (this is the extra distance)
  * Anis's total distance = 50 + 10 = 60 miles

3. To find the total distance both rowed together:
* Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis's distance
* Total distance = 50 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how far Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 

To find out how far Anis rowed, we multiply Dijana's distance by 1/5:

50 miles * 1/5 = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana. 

To find out the total distance Anis rowed, we add these 10 miles to Dijana's 50 miles:

50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

To find out the total distance both of them rowed, we add Dijana's distance to An...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday.

Given:
- Dijana rowed for 50 miles.
- Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Anis rowed.
To find the distance Anis rowed, we need to add 1/5 of Dijana's distance to Dijana's distance.

Anis's distance = Dijana's distance + (1/5 × Dijana's distance)
Anis's distance = 50 + (1/5 × 50)
Anis's distance ...
