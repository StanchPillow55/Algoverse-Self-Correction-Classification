=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of articles published by the two websites in February, we will first calculate the daily output of articles for each website and then multiply by the number of days in February.

1. **Calculate the daily articles published by each website:**
   - The news website publishes an average of 20 political and weather news articles daily.
   - The sister company publishes an average of 10 business news articles daily.

2. **Calculate the total daily articles published by both websites:**
   \[
   \text{Total daily articles} = \text{Articles from news website} + \text{Articles from sister company}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily articles} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of articles published in February:**
   - February has 28 days.
   \[
   \text{Total articles in February} = \text{Total daily articles} \times \text{Number of days in February}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total articles in February} = 30 \times 28
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   30 \times 28 = 840
   \]

Thus, the total number of articles published by both websites together in February is **840**.

Final answer: **840 articles**.
