=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of grapes Madeline ate:**
   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Calculate the number of grapes her brother used:**
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make grape juice.
   - Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is:
     \[
     5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of grapes used by Madeline and her brother:**
   - Total grapes used = grapes eaten by Madeline + grapes used by her brother
   - Total grapes used = \(6 + 30 = 36\) grapes.

4. **Determine the number of grapes used for the pies:**
   - The pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie, and their mother made 4 pies.
   - Therefore, the total number of grapes used for the pies is:
     \[
     12 \times 4 = 48 \text{ grapes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of grapes at the beginning:**
   - The total number of grapes at the beginning is the sum of the grapes used by Madeline, her brother, and their mother.
   - Total grapes at the beginning = grapes used by Madeline + grapes used by her brother + grapes used for pies
   - Total grapes at the beginning = \(6 + 30 + 48\)
   - Total grapes at the beginning = \(84\) grapes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of grapes at the beginning. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of grapes Madeline ate:**
   - Madeline ate 6 grapes.

2. **Determine the number of grapes her brother used:**
   - Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline.
   - Therefore, the number of grapes her brother used is \(5 \times 6 = 30\) grapes.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Madeline ate 6 grapes
* Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline
* Mother made 4 pies
* Each pie needs 12 grapes

2. Calculate how many grapes the brother used:
* Brother's grapes = 5 × Madeline's grapes
* Brother's grapes = 5 × 6 = 30 grapes

3. Calculate how many grapes were used for pies:
* Grapes per pie = 12
* Number of pies = 4
* Total grapes for pies = 12 × 4 = 48 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem:

1. Madeline ate 6 grapes.
2. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline did to make grape juice. So, he used 5 * 6 = <<5*6=30>>30 grapes.
3. Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies, and each pie requires 12 grapes. So, she used 4 * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 grapes.

Adding up all the grapes used, we get:

6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 48 (mother) = 84 grapes

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Madeline ate 6 grapes.
   * Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass of juice.
   * Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.
   * Each pie recipe requires 12 grapes.

2. Calculate the number of grapes Madeline's brother used:
   * Brother's grapes = 5 × Madeline's grapes
   * Brother's grapes = 5 × 6 = 30 grapes
