=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much money Iris spent at the spa, we will break down her expenses step by step.

1. **Cost of Hair**: 
   Iris spent $400 on her hair.

2. **Cost of Manicure**: 
   According to the problem, she spent \( \frac{1}{4} \) as much on her manicure as she did on her hair. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   \]

3. **Cost of Pedicure**: 
   The problem states that she spent \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much money on her pedicure as she did on her manicure. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   \]

4. **Total Cost**: 
   Now, we will add up all the costs to find the total amount Iris spent at the spa.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hair} + \text{Cost of Manicure} + \text{Cost of Pedicure}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 400 + 100 + 75
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 575
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Iris spent at the spa is \(\boxed{575}\).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Hair cost = $400
* Manicure cost = 1/4 of hair cost
* Pedicure cost = 3/4 of manicure cost

2. Calculate manicure cost:
* Manicure = 1/4 × $400
* Manicure = $100

3. Calculate pedicure cost:
* Pedicure = 3/4 × manicure cost
* Pedicure = 3/4 × $100
* Pedicure = $75

4. Add all costs together:
* Total = Hair + Manicure + Pedicure
* Total = $400 + $100 + $75
