=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate her monthly expenses for food, treats, and medicine, and then multiply that total by the number of months in a year.

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of dog food.**

Madeline buys dog food at a cost of $25 per week. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the monthly cost of food as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly cost of food} = \text{Cost per week} \times \text{Number of weeks in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly cost of food} = 25 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total monthly expenses.**

Now we need to add the costs of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost:

- Monthly cost of treats = $20
- Monthly cost of medicine = $100

Now, we sum these costs:

\[
\text{Total monthly expenses} = \text{Monthly cost of food} + \text{Monthly cost of treats} + \text{Monthly cost of medicine}
\]
\[
\text{Total monthly expenses} = 100 \, \text{dollars} + 20 \, \text{dollars} + 100 \, \text{dollars} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the annual expenses.**

To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we multiply the total monthly expenses by the number of months in a year (12 months):

\[
\text{Annual expenses} = \text{Total monthly expenses} \times \text{Number of months in a year}
\]
\[
\text{Annual expenses} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 2640 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Madeline spends a total of **$2640** on her dog per year.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Food costs $25 per week.
- Treats cost $20 per month.
- Medicine costs $100 per month.
- There are 4 weeks in a month.

Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of food.
Cost of food per week = $25
Cost of food per month = $25 × 4 weeks = $100

Step 2: Calculate the yearly cost of food.
Cost of food per year = $100 × 12 months = $1,200

Step 3: Calculate the yearly cost of treats.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total annual cost for Madeline's dog's food, treats, and medicine. We'll break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Monthly Cost of Food
Madeline spends $25 per week on food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we calculate the monthly cost of food as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly Food Cost} = 25 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the monthly cost for food
* Food costs $25 per week
* There are 4 weeks in a month
* Monthly food cost = $25 × 4 = $100 per month

2. Now we have all monthly costs:
* Food: $100 per month
* Treats: $20 per month
* Medicine: $100 per month
* Total monthly cost = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220 per month

3. To find yearly cost:
* There are 12 months in a year
* Yearly cost = Monthly cost × 12
* Yea...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Madeline spends on food for her dog per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, she spends 25 * 4 = $100 on food per month.

Next, let's add the cost of treats and medicine to the monthly food cost. The treats cost $20 per month and the medicine costs $100 per month. So, the total monthly cost is 100 (food) + 20 (treats) + 100 (medicine) = $220.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step and calculate the total amount Madeline spends on her dog per year.

Given:
- Food costs $25 per week
- Treats cost $20 per month
- Medicine costs $100 per month
- There are 4 weeks in a month

Step 1: Calculate the monthly cost of food.
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the weekly food cost by 4.
Monthly food cost = $25 × 4 = $100

Step 2: Calculate the total monthly cost for Madeline's do...
