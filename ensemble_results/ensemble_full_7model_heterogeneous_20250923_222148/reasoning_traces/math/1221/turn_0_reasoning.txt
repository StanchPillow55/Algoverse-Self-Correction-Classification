=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need for 80 meatballs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pounds of ground beef needed**:
   Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. We need to find out how many pounds of ground beef are required to make 80 meatballs.

   We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs needed}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of ground beef} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed**:
   Aiden uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since we have determined that he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can calculate the total amount of seasoning required.

   We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Total seasoning needed} = \text{Number of pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Total seasoning needed} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Aiden will need a total of 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ tablespoons}}
\]
