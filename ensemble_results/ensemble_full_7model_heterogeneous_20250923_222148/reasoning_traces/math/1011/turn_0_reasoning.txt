=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how much water Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days, and then we will calculate how much water is left to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 18000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Day 1: Calculate how much water Wanda pumped.**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
   \[
   \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Day 1: Calculate how much water Ms. B pumped.**
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda:
   \[
   \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Day 1: Calculate the total water pumped on Day 1.**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Day 2: Calculate how much water Wanda pumped.**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on Day 1:
   \[
   \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Day 2: Calculate how much water Ms. B pumped.**
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on Day 1:
   \[
   \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

7. **Day 2: Calculate the total water pumped on Day 2.**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

8. **Calculate the total water pumped over the two days.**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped in 2 days} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

9. **Calculate the remaining water needed to fill the tank.**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total water pumped}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6000} \text{ gallons}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then subtract it from the tank's capacity to find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank.

Given information:
- The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
- On the first day:
  - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
  - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
- On the second day:
  - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then determine how much more water is needed to fill the tank to its full capacity of 18,000 gallons.

### Day 1 Calculations:

1. **Wanda's Contribution on Day 1:**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity.
   - The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
   - Therefore, the amount of water Wanda pumped on Day 1 is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 18,0...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how much water Wanda pumped on day 1
* Tank capacity = 18000 gallons
* Wanda pumped 1/4 of tank = 18000 × (1/4) = 4500 gallons

2. Calculate how much Ms. B pumped on day 1
* Ms. B pumped 3/4 of what Wanda pumped
* Ms. B day 1 = 4500 × (3/4) = 3375 gallons

3. Calculate how much Wanda pumped on day 2
* Wanda day 2 = 2/3 of her day 1 amount
* Wanda day 2 = 4500 × (2/3) = 3000 gallons

4. Calculate...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The capacity of the tank is 18000 gallons.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water. That is 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons.

On the first day, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank that day. That is 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.

So, on the first day, they pumped a total of 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. That is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons.
- On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity.
- On the first day, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
- On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.
- On the second day, Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the amount she pumped on the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of gallons Wanda pumped on the first day.
