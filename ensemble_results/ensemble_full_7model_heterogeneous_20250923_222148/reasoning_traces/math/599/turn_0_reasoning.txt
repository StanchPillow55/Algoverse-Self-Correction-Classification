=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of legs that the pets in the store have, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of pet and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the number of each type of pet:**
   - Dogs: 5
   - Cats: 2
   - Birds: 10

2. **Determine the number of legs for each type of pet:**
   - Each dog has 4 legs.
   - Each cat has 4 legs.
   - Each bird has 2 legs.

3. **Calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:**
   - **Dogs:**
     \[
     \text{Total legs from dogs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Legs per dog} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

   - **Cats:**
     \[
     \text{Total legs from cats} = \text{Number of cats} \times \text{Legs per cat} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ legs}
     \]

   - **Birds:**
     \[
     \text{Total legs from birds} = \text{Number of birds} \times \text{Legs per bird} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ legs}
     \]

4. **Sum the total number of legs from all pets:**
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from dogs} + \text{Total legs from cats} + \text{Total legs from birds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 \text{ legs}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The total number of legs in the pet store is **48 legs**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify how many legs each type of animal has:
* Dogs have 4 legs each
* Cats have 4 legs each
* Birds have 2 legs each

2. Now let's calculate legs for each type of animal:

Dogs:
* 5 dogs × 4 legs = 20 legs from dogs

Cats:
* 2 cats × 4 legs = 8 legs from cats

Birds:
* 10 birds × 2 legs = 20 legs from birds

3. Add all legs together:
* Total legs = Dogs' legs + Cats' legs + Birds' legs
* Total le...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to know how many legs each type of pet has. 

Dogs and cats each have 4 legs, while birds have 2 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add up the total number of legs for all the pets:

Total legs = 20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs

So, the pets in the ...
