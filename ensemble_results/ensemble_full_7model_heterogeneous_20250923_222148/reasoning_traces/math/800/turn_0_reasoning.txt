=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Nikita scored based on the information given about Pierson's score, and then calculate the total points scored by both Pierson and Nikita.

1. **Identify Pierson's score**: 
   Pierson scored 278 points.

2. **Calculate Nikita's score**:
   According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. We can express this mathematically.

   - First, we find half of Pierson's score:
     \[
     \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
     \]

   - Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
     \[
     \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
     \]

3. **Calculate the total score**:
   Now that we have both scores, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's and Nikita's scores together:
   \[
   \text{Total score} = \text{Pierson's score} + \text{Nikita's score} = 278 + 150
   \]

   Performing the addition:
   \[
   278 + 150 = 428
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita is:
   \[
   \boxed{428}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Pierson scored 278 points in one game of bowling.
- Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson.

Step 1: Calculate how many points Nikita scored.
Half of Pierson's score = 278 รท 2 = 139 points
Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

Step 2: Calculate the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita.
Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
Total points = 278 + 150 = 428 poi...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Pierson's score
* Pierson scored 278 points

2. Next, let's find Nikita's score
* Half of Pierson's score = 278 รท 2 = 139 points
* Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score
* So Nikita's score = 139 + 11 = 150 points

3. Finally, let's find the total points
* Total points = Pierson's score + Nikita's score
* Total points = 278 + 150 = 428 points

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita had a tota...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. To do this, we first find half of the points Pierson scored. 

Half of Pierson's score is 278/2 = 139 points.

Nikita scored 11 more than this, so she scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.

To find the total points they scored, we add Pierson's score to Nikita's score.

So, 278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428 points.

Therefore, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Pierson scored 278 points in the bowling game.
   * Nikita scored 11 more than half of Pierson's score.

2. Calculate half of Pierson's score:
   * Half of Pierson's score = 278 รท 2
   * Half of Pierson's score = 139

3. Calculate Nikita's score:
   * Nikita's score = Half of Pierson's score + 11
   * Nikita's score = 139 + 11
   * Nikita's score = 150

4. Sum up Piers...
