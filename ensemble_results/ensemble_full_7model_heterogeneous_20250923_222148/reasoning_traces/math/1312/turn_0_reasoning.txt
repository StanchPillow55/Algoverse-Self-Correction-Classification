=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from reservations over the days they are open. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   - Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of reservations per week is:
     \[
     \text{Total reservations per week} = \text{Reservations per night} \times \text{Days open per week} = 6 \times 2 = 12
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost per reservation:**
   - Each reservation includes:
     - 2 meals at $5 each
     - 1 bottle of wine at $5
   - First, calculate the total cost of meals:
     \[
     \text{Cost of meals} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - Next, add the cost of the wine:
     \[
     \text{Total cost per reservation} = \text{Cost of meals} + \text{Cost of wine} = 10 + 5 = 15
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - Now that we know the total cost per reservation is $15, we can find the total revenue for the week:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue per week} = \text{Total reservations per week} \times \text{Total cost per reservation} = 12 \times 15 = 180
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Tom's restaurant makes a total of $180 per week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* 6 reservations per night
* Each reservation orders:
  * 2 meals at $5 each ($10 total for meals)
  * 1 bottle of wine at $5
* Open 2 days per week

2. Calculate spending per reservation:
* Cost of meals = 2 × $5 = $10
* Cost of wine = $5
* Total per reservation = $10 + $5 = $15

3. Calculate total per night:
* Revenue per night = $15 × 6 reservations
* Revenue per nigh...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money Tom's restaurant makes from one reservation.

Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine. So, the total cost for one reservation is 2*$5 (for the meals) + $5 (for the wine) = $10 + $5 = $15.

Since the restaurant gets 6 reservations a night, the total income from one night is 6 reservations * $15/reservation = $90.

The restaurant is open 2 days a week, so the total income from one week is 2 days * $90/d...
