=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Group Composition**:
   - There are a total of 20 kids.
   - They are divided into two equal groups, which means there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculating the Total Shells Brought by Boys**:
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.
   - Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Girls' Contribution**:
   - According to the problem, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The total number of shells brought back by the girls can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by girls} = \text{Total shells by boys} + 4 \times \text{Total shells by boys}
     \]
   - Substituting the total shells brought by boys:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by girls} = 600 + 4 \times 600
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Shells Brought by Girls**:
   - First, calculate \(4 \times 600\):
     \[
     4 \times 600 = 2400
     \]
   - Now, add this to the total shells brought by boys:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by girls} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ shells}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Shells Brought by Each Girl**:
   - Since there are 10 girls, we need to find out how many shells each girl brought back:
     \[
     \text{Shells per girl} = \frac{\text{Total shells by girls}}{\text{Number of girls}} = \frac{3000}{10} = 300 \text{ shells}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Each girl brought back **300 seashells**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back from the scavenger hunt.

First, let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. There are 20 kids in total, divided equally into two groups: boys and girls.
2. Since the groups are equal, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by all the boys is calculated as follows:

\[
\...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total number of kids = 20
* They were divided into equal groups of boys and girls
* So, number of boys = number of girls = 10 each
* Each boy brought 60 shells

2. Let's find total shells brought by boys:
* Shells per boy = 60
* Number of boys = 10
* Total shells by boys = 60 Ã— 10 = 600 shells

3. Now for the girls:
* Girls brought equal to boys' shells PLUS 4 times bo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many boys and girls there are. Since the problem states that the kids were divided into two equal groups of boys and girls, this means there are 20 kids / 2 = 10 boys and 10 girls.

Next, we know that each boy brought back 60 seashells. So, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 seashells/boy * 10 boys = 600 seashells.

The problem states that the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boy...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given information:
- There are 20 kids in total.
- They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
- Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
- Each girl brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.

Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls in each group.
Total kids = 20
Number of groups = 2
