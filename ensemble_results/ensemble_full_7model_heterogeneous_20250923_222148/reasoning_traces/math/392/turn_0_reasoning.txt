=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we will first calculate the total cost of the streaming services and then compare it to the cost of the cable package.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of streaming services

1. **Netflix**: 
   - Cost = $10 per month

2. **Hulu and Disney Plus**: 
   - Normal cost = $10 per month each
   - Total normal cost for both = $10 + $10 = $20 per month
   - Since Tim bundles these services, he saves 20% on the total cost.

   To calculate the savings from bundling:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
   \]

   Now, we subtract the savings from the normal cost:
   \[
   \text{Bundled cost} = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

3. **Total cost of streaming services**:
   \[
   \text{Total streaming cost} = \text{Cost of Netflix} + \text{Bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total streaming cost} = 10 + 16 = 26
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the savings from cancelling the cable subscription

1. **Cost of cable subscription**: 
   - Cable cost = $60 per month

2. **Calculate the savings**:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of cable} - \text{Total streaming cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 60 - 26 = 34
   \]

### Final Answer
Tim saves **$34** by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of streaming services:
* Netflix: $10/month
* Hulu: $10/month 
* Disney Plus: $10/month
* Hulu + Disney Plus bundle discount: 20% off $20
   * Bundle savings: $20 × 0.20 = $4
   * Bundle cost: $20 - $4 = $16

2. Total monthly streaming cost:
* Netflix ($10) + Hulu/Disney Bundle ($16) = $26/month

3. Compare to cable cost:
* Cable cost: $60/month
* Streaming cost: $26/month
* Monthl...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% discount. 

The normal cost for each is $10, so the total normal cost is $10 + $10 = $20.

A 20% discount on $20 is $20 * 0.20 = $4.

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding the cost of Netflix, which is $10, the total cost for all the streaming services is $16 + $10 = $26.

If Tim was previously paying $60 for cable, and now he's paying $26 for streaming service...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Tim's current cable subscription costs $60 per month.
   * Netflix costs $10 per month.
   * Hulu and Disney Plus each cost $10 per month, but there's a 20% discount for bundling them.

2. Calculate the cost of the Hulu and Disney Plus bundle:
   * Regular price for both services: $10 + $10 = $20 per month
   * Bundling discount: 20% of $20 = 0.2 × $20 = $4
   * Discou...
