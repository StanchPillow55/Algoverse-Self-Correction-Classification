=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much James pays on average for each pair of shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.**
   - James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year is:
     \[
     \text{Total pairs of shoes} = 2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
     \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per pair of shoes.**
   - James spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year.
   - To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount spent by the total number of pairs bought:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per pair} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Total pairs of shoes}} = \frac{2640 \text{ dollars}}{24 \text{ pairs}}
     \]

3. **Perform the division to find the average cost per pair.**
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{2640}{24} = 110
     \]

Thus, the average cost per pair of shoes that James pays is **$110**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the average cost of each pair of shoes that James buys.

Given information:
- James buys 2 pairs of shoes a month.
- He spends $2640 on shoes each year.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
Number of pairs of shoes per month × Number of months in a year = Total number of pairs of shoes per year
2 pairs × 12 months = 24 pairs of shoes

Step 2: Calculate the average cost of ea...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the average cost James pays for each pair of shoes. We are given the following information:

1. James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month.
2. He spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year.**

Since James buys 2 pairs of shoes each month, we can calculate the total number of pairs he buys in a year by multiplyin...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month
* He spends $2640 per year
* We need to find the average cost per pair

2. Let's calculate how many pairs of shoes he buys per year:
* Pairs per month = 2
* Months in a year = 12
* Total pairs per year = 2 × 12 = 24 pairs

3. Now we can calculate the average cost per pair:
* Total spent per year = $2640
* Total pairs per year = 24

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Next, we need to figure out how much he spends on each pair of shoes on average. We know he spends $2640 in total each year. To find the average cost per pair, we divide the total amount he spends by the t...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * James buys 2 pairs of shoes every month.
   * He spends a total of $2640 on shoes each year.

2. Calculate the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year:
   * Pairs of shoes per month = 2
   * Months in a year = 12
   * Total pairs of shoes in a year = Pairs per month × Months in a year
   * Total pairs of shoes in a year = 2 × 12 = 24 pairs

3. Calculate the...
