=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we will calculate the total revenue for both Thursday and Friday separately and then compare the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Thursday's Revenue**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- 6 truck tires
- 4 car tires

The charges are:
- $60 per truck tire
- $40 per car tire

Now, we calculate the revenue from truck tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = \text{Number of truck tires} \times \text{Charge per truck tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = 6 \times 60 = 360 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = \text{Number of car tires} \times \text{Charge per car tire}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = 4 \times 40 = 160 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the revenues from truck and car tires to find the total revenue for Thursday:
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = \text{Revenue from truck tires} + \text{Revenue from car tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Friday's Revenue**

On Friday, the mechanic repairs:
- 0 truck tires
- 12 car tires

The revenue from truck tires is:
\[
\text{Revenue from truck tires} = 0 \times 60 = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the revenue from car tires:
\[
\text{Revenue from car tires} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the revenues from truck and car tires to find the total revenue for Friday:
\[
\text{Total revenue on Friday} = \text{Revenue from truck tires} + \text{Revenue from car tires}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue on Friday} = 0 + 480 = 480 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Compare the Revenues**

Now we compare the total revenues from Thursday and Friday:
- Total revenue on Thursday: 520 dollars
- Total revenue on Friday: 480 dollars

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue (Thursday), we calculate:
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = \text{Total revenue on Thursday} - \text{Total revenue on Friday}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in revenue} = 520 - 480 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The mechanic earned **$40** more on Thursday than on Friday.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue earned by the mechanic on Thursday and Friday, and then find the difference between the higher revenue day and the lower revenue day.

Given information:
- The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire repaired and $40 for each car tire repaired.
- On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.
- On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and no truck tires.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the revenue earned by the mechanic on each day and then compare the two to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue for Thursday.**

On Thursday, the mechanic repairs:
- 6 truck tires at $60 each
- 4 car tires at $40 each

First, calculate the revenue from the truck tires:
\[ \text{Revenue from truck tires} = 6 \text{ tires} \times \$60/\text{tire} = \$360 \]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate Thursday's revenue:
* Truck tires: 6 tires × $60 per tire = $360
* Car tires: 4 tires × $40 per tire = $160
* Total Thursday revenue = $360 + $160 = $520

2. Next, let's calculate Friday's revenue:
* Truck tires: 0 tires × $60 per tire = $0
* Car tires: 12 tires × $40 per tire = $480
* Total Friday revenue = $0 + $480 = $480

3. Now let's compare the two days:
* Thursday: $520
* Friday: $48...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much the mechanic earned on each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Since the mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire, the total revenue for Thursday is:

6 truck tires * $60/truck tire + 4 car tires * $40/car tire = $360 + $160 = $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. So, the total revenue for Friday is:

12 car tires * $40/car t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Truck tire repair cost: $60 per tire
   * Car tire repair cost: $40 per tire
   * Thursday: 6 truck tires and 4 car tires repaired
   * Friday: 12 car tires repaired, no truck tires

2. Calculate the revenue for Thursday:
   * Revenue from truck tires = 6 × $60 = $360
   * Revenue from car tires = 4 × $40 = $160
   * Total revenue on Thursday = $360 + $160 = $520
