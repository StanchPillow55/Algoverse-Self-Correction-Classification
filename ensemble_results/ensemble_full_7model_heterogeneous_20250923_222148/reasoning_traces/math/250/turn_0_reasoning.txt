=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students in the school.**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of boys and girls in the school.**
   The school is 50% boys and 50% girls. Thus, the number of boys and girls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ boys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of girls in the first and second classes.**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.

   Now, we can calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes:
   \[
   \text{Total girls in first and second classes} = 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ girls}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of girls in the third class.**
   Since there are a total of 30 girls in the school, we can find the number of girls in the third class by subtracting the number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls:
   \[
   \text{Girls in third class} = 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ girls}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of boys in the third class.**
   Each class has 20 students. Since we have already determined that there are 3 girls in the third class, we can find the number of boys in the third class:
   \[
   \text{Boys in third class} = 20 - \text{Girls in third class} = 20 - 3 = 17 \text{ boys}
   \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is \( \boxed{17} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many students are in the school in total. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, there are 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 students in total.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, this means there are 60 / 2 = <<60/2=30>>30 boys and 30 girls in the school.

Next, let's find out how many girls are in the third class. We know that the first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the f...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Each class has 20 students.
   * There are 3 classes in total.
   * The school has an equal number of boys and girls (50% each).
   * The first class has 15 girls.
   * The second class has 12 girls.

2. Calculate the total number of students in the school:
