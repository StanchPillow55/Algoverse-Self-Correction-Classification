=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Katina will have remaining in her savings account after 2 years of withdrawing $100 each month, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the savings account**: 
   Katina starts with $3000.

2. **Determine the monthly withdrawal amount**: 
   Katina withdraws $100 each month.

3. **Calculate the total number of months in 2 years**: 
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of months in 2 years as follows:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount withdrawn over 2 years**: 
   To find out how much money Katina will withdraw in total over the 2 years, we multiply the monthly withdrawal amount by the total number of months:
   \[
   100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining balance in the savings account**: 
   To find the remaining balance after 2 years, we subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount in the savings account:
   \[
   3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   After 2 years of withdrawing $100 each month, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Initial amount: $3000
* Monthly withdrawal: $100
* Time period: 2 years

2. Convert years to months to find total number of withdrawals:
* 2 years = 2 × 12 = 24 months
* So there will be 24 withdrawals of $100 each

3. Calculate total amount withdrawn over 2 years:
* Total withdrawn = Number of withdrawals × Amount per withdrawal
* Total withdrawn = 24 × $100
* Total w...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to understand how much money Katina will remove from her savings account over the course of 2 years. 

We know that there are 12 months in a year. Therefore, in 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.

If Katina removes $100 from her account every month, over 2 years she will remove 24 * $100 = $2400.

Katina started with $3000 in her savings account. If she removes $2400 over 2 years, the remaining amount in her account will be $3000 -...
