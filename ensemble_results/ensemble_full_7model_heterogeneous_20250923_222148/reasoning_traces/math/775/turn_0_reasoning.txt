Final Answer: To determine how many wheels will be left after Henry assembles the toys, we first need to calculate the total number of wheels required for both the cars and the motorcycles.

1. **Calculate the wheels needed for the cars:**
   - Henry needs 4 wheels for each car.
   - He has 57 cars.
   - Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
     \[
     \text{Wheels for cars} = 57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels/car} = 228 \text{ wheels}
     \]

2. **Calculate the wheels needed for the motorcycles:**
   - Henry needs 2 wheels for each motorcycle.
   - He has 73 motorcycles.
   - Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
     \[
     \text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \text{ motorcycles} \times 2 \text{ wheels/motorcycle} = 146 \text{ wheels}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed:**
   - Now, we add the wheels needed for the cars and the motorcycles:
     \[
     \text{Total wheels needed} = \text{Wheels for cars} + \text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 228 \text{ wheels} + 146 \text{ wheels} = 374 \text{ wheels}
     \]

4. **Determine how many wheels are left:**
   - Henry starts with 650 wheels.
   - We subtract the total number of wheels needed from the number of wheels he has:
     \[
     \text{Wheels left} = \text{Total wheels available} - \text{Total wheels needed} = 650 \text{ wheels} - 374 \text{ wheels} = 276 \text{ wheels}
     \]

Thus, after assembling all the toys, Henry will have **276 wheels left**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{276}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Henry needs to assemble 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.
2. For each car, he needs 4 wheels.
3. For each motorcycle, he needs 2 wheels.
4. So, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
   * 57 cars x 4 wheels per car = 228 wheels
5. The total number of wheels needed for the motorcycles is:
   * 73 motorcycles x 2 wheels per motorcycle = 146 wheels
6. The total number of wheels needed for all the toys i...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of wheels required to assemble all the cars and motorcycles, and then compare this to the number of wheels Henry has available.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the total number of wheels needed for the cars:**
   - Each car requires 4 wheels.
   - Henry needs to assemble 57 cars.
   - Therefore, the total number of wheels needed for the cars is:
     \[
     57 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ wheels pe...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many wheels are needed for the cars:
   * Each car needs 4 wheels
   * Number of cars = 57
   * Wheels needed for cars = 57 × 4 = 228 wheels

2. Next, let's calculate how many wheels are needed for the motorcycles:
   * Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels
   * Number of motorcycles = 73
   * Wheels needed for motorcycles = 73 × 2 = 146 wheels

3. Now, let's find the total number of wheels ne...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how many wheels Henry needs to assemble all the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars, since each car needs 4 wheels, the total number of wheels needed for all cars is 57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels.

For the motorcycles, since each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, the total number of wheels needed for all motorcycles is 73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels.

Adding these two amounts together, the total number of wheels needed for all...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Henry needs to assemble 57 cars and 73 motorcycles.
   * Each car requires 4 wheels.
   * Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
   * Henry has a box with 650 wheels.

2. Calculate the number of wheels needed for the cars:
   * Number of cars = 57
   * Wheels per car = 4
   * Wheels needed for cars = 57 × 4 = 228 wheels

3. Calculate the number of wheels needed for t...
