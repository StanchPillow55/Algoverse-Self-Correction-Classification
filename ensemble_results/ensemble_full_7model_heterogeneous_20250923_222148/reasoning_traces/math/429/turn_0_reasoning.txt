Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of letters in Indras' name and her sister's name based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of letters in Indras' name:**
   - According to the problem, Indras has 6 letters in her name.

2. **Calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:**
   - Half of the letters in Indras' name is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Half of Indras' letters} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]

3. **Determine the number of letters in her sister's name:**
   - The problem states that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. Therefore, we add 4 to the half we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Sister's letters} = \text{Half of Indras' letters} + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

4. **Summarize the findings:**
   - Indras has 6 letters in her name.
   - Her sister has 7 letters in her name.
