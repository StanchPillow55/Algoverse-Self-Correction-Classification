=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of apples in two boxes.**
2. **Calculate how many packs can be made with the total number of apples, given that each pack contains eight apples.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples

We know that:
- There are 40 apples in one box.
- Uncle Franky ordered 2 boxes.

To find the total number of apples, we multiply the number of apples in one box by the number of boxes:

\[
\text{Total apples} = \text{Number of apples per box} \times \text{Number of boxes}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total apples} = 40 \text{ apples/box} \times 2 \text{ boxes} = 80 \text{ apples}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of packs

Next, we need to determine how many packs can be made from the total number of apples. Each pack contains 8 apples. We can find the number of packs by dividing the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:

\[
\text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per pack}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of packs} = \frac{80 \text{ apples}}{8 \text{ apples/pack}} = 10 \text{ packs}
\]

### Final Answer

Uncle Franky can make **10 packs** of apples with the two boxes of apples.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- There are 40 apples in one box.
- Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples.
- He is planning to pack the apples with 8 apples in one pack.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of apples in the two boxes.
Total number of apples = Number of apples in one box × Number of boxes
Total number of apples = 40 × 2 = 80 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of packs of apples that can be made...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make if he has two boxes of apples, with each box containing forty apples, and he wants to pack them with eight apples in each pack.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of apples:**

   Uncle Franky ordered two boxes of apples, and each box contains forty apples. Therefore, the total number of apples can be calculated by multiplying the number of...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of apples Uncle Franky has:
* One box has 40 apples
* He ordered 2 boxes
* Total apples = 40 × 2 = 80 apples

2. Now, we need to find how many packs he can make:
* Each pack will have 8 apples
* To find number of packs, divide total apples by apples per pack
* Number of packs = 80 ÷ 8 = 10 packs

Reasoning:
* Since Uncle Franky wants to put 8 apples in each pack
* And he has 80 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are 40 apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we multiply 40 by 2. 

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make. Since each pack contains 8 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each pack.

80 apples ÷ 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the...
