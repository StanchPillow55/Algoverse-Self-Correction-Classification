=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much change the cashier gives back to the mother after her shopping, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent by the mother.**
   We will add the prices of the items she bought:
   - Cocoa: $4.20
   - Laundry: $9.45
   - Package of pasta: $1.35

   Let's perform the addition step by step:

   \[
   4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
   \]

   Now, we add the cost of the package of pasta:

   \[
   13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
   \]

   So, the total amount spent by the mother is **$15.00**.

2. **Determine how much money the mother paid.**
   The mother paid $20.00.

3. **Calculate the change to be given back.**
   To find the change, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount paid:

   \[
   20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
   \]

Thus, the cashier gives back **$5.00** in change.

4. **Final answer:**
   The change the cashier gives back is **$5.00**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's list all the items and their costs:
* Cocoa: $4.20
* Laundry: $9.45
* Pasta: $1.35

2. To find the total cost, I'll add all the items:
* $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
* = $15.00

3. The mother pays with $20.00
* To find the change, I subtract the total cost from the payment
* $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier should give back $5.00 in change.

Final Answer: $5.00

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out how much the mother spent in total and then subtract that amount from the $20 she gave to the cashier.

First, let's add up the cost of the items she bought:

Cocoa: $4.20
Laundry: $9.45
Pasta: $1.35

Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

Now, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she gave to the cashier:

Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

So, the cashier gives the mother $5.00 back in change.
