=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how long Royce takes to shingle a house based on the time it takes Rob.

1. **Identify the time Rob takes**: 
   Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house. We need to convert this time into minutes because the final answer should be in minutes.
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Calculate double Rob's time**:
   According to the problem, Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. First, we calculate double Rob's time:
   \[
   \text{Double Rob's time} = 2 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Add 40 minutes to double Rob's time**:
   Now, we add 40 minutes to the result from the previous step to find out how long Royce takes:
   \[
   \text{Royce's time} = 240 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 280 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total time Royce takes to shingle the house is:
   \[
   \boxed{280} \text{ minutes}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time it takes Rob to shingle a house.
- Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house.

Step 1: Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes.
Rob's time = 2 hours
Rob's time in minutes = 2 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Step 2: Calculate double the time it takes Rob to shingle the house.
Double Rob's time = 2 × 120 minutes = 240 minutes

Step 3: Ca...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Royce takes to shingle a house given that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes, and Rob takes 2 hours.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes:**
   - Rob takes 2 hours to shingle the house.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.
   - \( 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to convert Rob's time from hours to minutes because the problem is asking for the answer in minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

The problem states that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we need to calculate double the time Rob takes, which is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Then, we add the extra 40 minutes that Royce takes, which is 240 minutes + 40 minut...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Rob takes 2 hours to shingle a house.
   * Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes.

2. Convert Rob's time to minutes:
   * Rob's time = 2 hours
   * 1 hour = 60 minutes
   * Rob's time in minutes = 2 × 60 = 120 minutes

3. Calculate double the time Rob takes:
   * Double Rob's time = 2 × Rob's time
   * Double Rob's time = 2 × 120 minutes = 240 minu...
