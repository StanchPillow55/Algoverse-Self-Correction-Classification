=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many jewels Siobhan has based on the information provided about Aaron and Raymond.

1. **Identify the number of jewels Raymond has:**
   - According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - First, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels:
     \[
     \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Now, we can find out how many jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Therefore, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. Since Raymond has 40 jewels, half of that would be 40/2 = 20 jewels. So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

The problem also tells us that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.
