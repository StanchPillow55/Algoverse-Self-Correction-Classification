=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many beads Adrianne has altogether, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of beads given by each person:**
   - Adrianne's mother gave her **20 metallic beads**.
   - Adrianne's sister gave her **ten more beads than her mother**. Since her mother gave 20 beads, we calculate the number of beads from her sister:
     \[
     \text{Sister's beads} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads}
     \]
   - Adrianne's friend gave her **twice as many beads as her mother**. Since her mother gave 20 beads, we calculate the number of beads from her friend:
     \[
     \text{Friend's beads} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of beads:**
   Now, we will add the number of beads from her mother, sister, and friend together:
   \[
   \text{Total beads} = \text{Mother's beads} + \text{Sister's beads} + \text{Friend's beads}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total beads} = 20 + 30 + 40
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   Now, we will add these numbers step by step:
   \[
   20 + 30 = 50
   \]
   Then, we add the result to the number of beads from her friend:
   \[
   50 + 40 = 90
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of beads Adrianne has altogether is:
   \[
   \boxed{90}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of beads Adrianne received from each person and then add them together to get the total number of beads.

Given information:
- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
- Adrianne's sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
- Adrianne's friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

Step 1: Find the number of beads Adrianne's sister gave her.
Beads from sister = Beads from mother + 10

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of beads Adrianne has collected from her mother, sister, and friend. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Beads from Adrianne's Mother:**
   - Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
   - Therefore, the number of beads from her mother is \( 20 \).

2. **Beads from Adrianne's Sister:**
   - Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother did.
   - Since her mother gave her 20 beads, her sist...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Mother gave 20 metallic beads
* Sister gave 10 more beads than mother
* Friend gave twice as many as mother

2. Let's calculate how many beads the sister gave:
* Mother gave 20 beads
* Sister gave 10 more than mother
* So sister gave: 20 + 10 = 30 beads

3. Let's calculate how many beads the friend gave:
* Mother gave 20 beads
* Friend gave twice as many
* So friend gave: 20 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.

Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother, which means her sister gave her 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 beads.

Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother gave, which means her friend gave her 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 beads.

To find out how many beads Adrianne had altogether, we need to add up all the beads she received. 

So, Adrianne had 20 (from her mother) + 30 (from her sister) + 40 (from her friend) = <<20+30+4...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many beads Adrianne has in total, we need to calculate the number of beads given by her sister and her friend, and then add them to the number of beads given by her mother.

Given:
- Adrianne's mother gave her 20 metallic beads.
- Her sister gave her ten more beads than her mother.
- Her friend gave her twice as many beads as her mother.

Step 1: Calculate the number of beads given by Adriann...
