=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of Jillian's handbag based on the information provided about the cost of her shoes.

1. **Identify the cost of the shoes**: 
   We are told that Jillian's shoes cost $80.

2. **Set up the equation for the handbag**: 
   According to the problem, Jillian's handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( S \) be the cost of the shoes, and \( B \) be the cost of the handbag. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   B = 3S - 20
   \]

3. **Substitute the cost of the shoes into the equation**: 
   Since we know that \( S = 80 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   B = 3(80) - 20
   \]

4. **Calculate \( 3 \times 80 \)**:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

5. **Subtract 20 from 240**:
   \[
   B = 240 - 20 = 220
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \( B = 220 \).

Final answer:
Jillian's handbag costs $220.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost.
- Jillian's shoes cost $80.

Step 1: Find 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes.
3 × $80 = $240

Step 2: Subtract $20 from the result in Step 1 to find the cost of Jillian's handbag.
$240 - $20 = $220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Jillian's shoes cost $80
* Her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times her shoes

2. Let's find 3 times the cost of her shoes:
* 3 × $80 = $240

3. Since her handbag cost $20 less than that amount:
* $240 - $20 = $220

Therefore, Jillian's handbag cost $220.

To verify:
* Shoes cost $80
* 3 times shoes = $240
* Handbag = $240 - $20 = $220

Final Answer: Jillian's handbag cost $220...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem states that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than 3 times as much as her shoes cost. 

First, we need to find out how much 3 times the cost of her shoes is. We do this by multiplying the cost of her shoes, which is $80, by 3. 

80 * 3 = $240

So, 3 times the cost of Jillian's shoes is $240. 

The problem then states that Jillian's handbag cost $20 less than this amount. To find out how much her handbag cost, we subtract $20 from $240. 

240 - 20 = $220

So, Jil...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up an equation and solve for the cost of Jillian's handbag.

Given:
- Jillian's shoes cost $80.
- Her handbag cost $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes.

Step 1: Let's express the cost of the handbag in terms of the cost of the shoes.
Handbag cost = 3 × (Shoe cost) - $20

Step 2: Substitute the given cost of the shoes into the equation.
Handbag cost = 3 × ($80) -...
