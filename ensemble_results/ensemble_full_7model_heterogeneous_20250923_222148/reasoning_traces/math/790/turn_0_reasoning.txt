=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
   We know that there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90 \text{ people}}{9 \text{ people/group}} = 10 \text{ groups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of groups that brought back seashells:**
   According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total number of groups brought back seashells. We need to calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 10 groups:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups bringing back seashells} = \frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of seashells brought back:**
   Each member of the groups that brought back seashells contributed 2 seashells. Since each group consists of 9 members, we first calculate the total number of members in the groups that brought back seashells:

   \[
   \text{Total members in groups bringing back seashells} = 6 \text{ groups} \times 9 \text{ members/group} = 54 \text{ members}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total number of seashells brought back by these members:

   \[
   \text{Total seashells} = 54 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ seashells/member} = 108 \text{ seashells}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back is:

   \[
   \boxed{108}
   \]

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of groups formed:**
   We know that there are 90 people and each group consists of 9 people. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

   \[
   \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90 \text{ people}}{9 \text{ people/group}} = 10 \text{ groups}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We are given that 90 people were required to split into groups for the competition.
2. The groups were formed with 9 people in each group.
3. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people (90) by the number of people in each group (9):
   * 90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

4. Now, we are told that 3/5 of the number of groups each had members bring back 2 seashells each.
5. To find 3/5 of the number...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells were brought back by the groups that collected them.

**Step 1: Determine the number of groups formed.**

We start with 90 people who need to be divided into groups of 9 people each. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:

\[
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 groups formed.

**Step 2: Determine how many groups collec...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of groups
* Total people = 90
* People per group = 9
* Number of groups = 90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

2. Find how many groups brought back seashells
* 3/5 of the groups brought seashells
* 3/5 × 10 = 6 groups brought seashells

3. Calculate seashells per group
* Each person in these groups brought 2 seashells
* People per group = 9
* Seashells per group = 9 people × 2 seashells = 18 sea...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many groups were formed. This can be done by dividing the total number of people by the number of people in each group. 

90 people ÷ 9 people/group = 10 groups

Next, we need to find out how many of these groups brought back 2 seashells each. According to the problem, 3/5 of the groups did this. 

10 groups × 3/5 = 6 groups

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells each gr...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 90 people in total.
   * They are split into groups of 9 people each.
   * 3/5 of the groups have members who bring back 2 seashells each.

2. Calculate the number of groups:
   * Number of groups = Total people ÷ People per group
   * Number of groups = 90 ÷ 9
   * Number of groups = 10

3. Find the number of groups where members bring back seashells:
