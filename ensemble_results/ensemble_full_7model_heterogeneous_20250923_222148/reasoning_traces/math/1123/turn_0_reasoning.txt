=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then find the total weight of all the dogs.

1. **Identify the weight of Kory's dog**:
   Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog**:
   Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog}
   \]
   Substituting the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog**:
   Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog}
   \]
   Substituting the weight of Kory's dog:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs**:
   Now we add the weights of both of Elijah's dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} + \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog}
   \]
   Substituting the weights we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 15 + 30 = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of all the dogs**:
   Finally, we need to find the total weight of all the dogs, which includes Kory's dog and both of Elijah's dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs}
   \]
   Substituting the weights:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = 60 + 45 = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is \(\boxed{105}\) pounds.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the weights of Elijah's two dogs and then add them to the weight of Kory's dog to get the total weight.

Given information:
- Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog.
- Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog.
- Kory's dog is 60 pounds.

Step 1: Find the weight of Elijah's first dog.
Weight of Elijah's first dog = 1/4 × Weight of Kory's dog
Weight of Elijah's first dog = 1/4 × 60 po...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's two dogs and then add those weights to the weight of Kory's dog to find the total weight of all the dogs.

1. **Identify the weight of Kory's dog:**
   - Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog:**
   - Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory’s dog.
   - To find one-fourth of Kory's dog's weight, we multiply 60 pounds by \(\frac{1}{4}\):
     \[

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds
* Elijah's first dog is 1/4 of Kory's dog's weight
* Elijah's second dog is 1/2 of Kory's dog's weight

Step 1: Calculate weight of Elijah's first dog
* First dog = 1/4 × 60 pounds
* First dog = 15 pounds

Step 2: Calculate weight of Elijah's second dog
* Second dog = 1/2 × 60 pounds
* Second dog = 30 pounds

Step 3: Add up weights of all three dogs
* Total weight = Kory's dog + ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Elijah's dogs weigh. 

Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can find the weight of Elijah's first dog by multiplying 60 by 1/4. 

60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. We can find the weight of Elijah's second dog by multiplying 60 by 1/2. 

60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds

So, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 pounds and 30 pounds respectively.
