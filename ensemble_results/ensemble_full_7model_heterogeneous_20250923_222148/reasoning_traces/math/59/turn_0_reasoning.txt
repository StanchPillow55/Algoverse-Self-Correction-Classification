=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the total number of fruit from the clusters and then add the number of individual fruit.

1. **Calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters:**
   - There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruit.
   - To find the total number of fruit in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruit in each cluster:
     \[
     \text{Total fruit in clusters} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruit per cluster}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fruit in clusters} = 6 \times 20 = 120
     \]

2. **Add the number of individual fruit:**
   - There are 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.
   - To find the total number of raspberries, we add the total number of fruit in the clusters to the number of individual fruit:
     \[
     \text{Total raspberries} = \text{Total fruit in clusters} + \text{Individual fruit}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total raspberries} = 120 + 67 = 187
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of raspberries on the bush is \( \boxed{187} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of 20 fruit each.
- The raspberry bush has 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters.
Number of clusters × Number of fruit per cluster = Total fruit in clusters
6 × 20 = 120 fruit

Step 2: Add the individual fruit to the total fruit in the clusters.
Total fruit in clusters + Individual fruit = T...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to consider both the clusters of fruit and the individual scattered fruit.

1. **Calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:**

   The bush has 6 clusters, and each cluster contains 20 raspberries. To find the total number of raspberries in all the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of raspberries per cluster:

   \[
   \text{Total raspberries in clusters...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many raspberries are in the clusters:
   * Each cluster has 20 raspberries
   * There are 6 clusters
   * Total raspberries in clusters = 6 × 20
   * Total raspberries in clusters = 120 raspberries

2. Next, add the individual scattered raspberries:
   * Scattered raspberries = 67
   * Total raspberries = Raspberries in clusters + Scattered raspberries
   * Total raspberries = 120 + 67
...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many raspberries are in the clusters. We do this by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of fruit in each cluster.

So, 6 clusters * 20 fruit/cluster = 120 fruit.

Next, we add the number of individual fruit scattered across the bush to the number of fruit in the clusters.

So, 120 fruit + 67 fruit = 187 fruit.

Therefore, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The raspberry bush has 6 clusters of raspberries
- Each cluster contains 20 raspberries
- There are also 67 individual raspberries scattered across the bush

Step 1: Calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters.
- Each cluster has 20 raspberries
- There are 6 clusters
To find the total, multiply the number of raspberries per cluster by the number of clusters:
20 raspberries/cl...
