=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many inches of ribbon Monica can use for each gift bow, we first need to calculate the total number of gifts she has to wrap. 

1. **Calculate the total number of gifts:**
   - Gifts for family: 6
   - Gifts for friends: 4
   - Gifts for teachers: 2

   We add these numbers together:
   \[
   \text{Total gifts} = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of ribbon available:**
   Monica has a total of 144 inches of ribbon.

3. **Calculate the amount of ribbon per gift bow:**
   To find out how many inches of ribbon can be used for each gift bow, we divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts:
   \[
   \text{Ribbon per gift bow} = \frac{\text{Total ribbon}}{\text{Total gifts}} = \frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{144}{12} = 12
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Monica has a total of 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. This gives a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

She has 144 inches of ribbon to use for all the gifts. If she wants to use the same amount of ribbon for each gift, she needs to divide the total amount of ribbon by the total number of gifts.

So, 144 inches รท 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.
