=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect in order to reach their goal of 100 signatures combined by the end of the summer.

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   - Carol has 20 signatures.
   - Jennifer has 44 signatures.
   - To find the total signatures they currently have, we add these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total signatures} = \text{Carol's signatures} + \text{Jennifer's signatures} = 20 + 44 = 64
   \]

2. **Determine the goal for the total number of signatures:**
   - The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures.

3. **Calculate how many more signatures they need to collect:**
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal:

   \[
   \text{Signatures needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total signatures} = 100 - 64 = 36
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Carol and Jennifer need to collect a total of 36 more signatures in the remaining three weeks of summer vacation to reach their goal of 100 signatures.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
2. Determine the remaining number of signatures needed to reach their goal of 100.
3. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures collected by the sisters so far.
Carol's signatures: 20
Jennifer's signatures: 44
Total signatures collected = 20 + 44 = 64

Step 2: Determine the remaining numb...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect together to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of their summer vacation.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have.**

Carol has 20 signatures, and Jennifer has 44 signatures. To find the total number of signatures they have collected so far, we add these two numbers together:

\[
20 + 44 = 64
\]

So, Carol and Jennifer currentl...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how many signatures they currently have together:
* Carol has 20 signatures
* Jennifer has 44 signatures
* Current total = 20 + 44 = 64 signatures

2. They want to reach 100 signatures total
* Target = 100 signatures

3. Calculate how many more signatures they need:
* Additional signatures needed = Target - Current total
* Additional signatures needed = 100 - 64 = 36 signatures

Therefore, C...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many signatures the sisters have collected so far. We do this by adding the number of signatures each sister has collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 signatures (Carol) + 44 signatures (Jennifer) = 64 signatures

So, the sisters have collected 64 signatures so far. 

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures the sisters need to reach their goal of 100 signatures. We do this by subtracting the num...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. To find out how many more signatures the sisters need to collect, we first need to calculate the total number of signatures they have now.

Given:
- Carol has 20 signatures in her book.
- Jennifer has 44 signatures in her book.
- The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of signatures the sisters have collected so far.
