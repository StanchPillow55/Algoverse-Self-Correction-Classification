Final Answer: To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor.**
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - The cost per tomato from the old vendor is $0.50.
   - Therefore, the daily cost with the old vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the new vendor.**
   - The cost per tomato from the new vendor is $0.40.
   - Therefore, the daily cost with the new vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.40 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings by switching vendors.**
   - The savings per day can be calculated by subtracting the daily cost with the new vendor from the daily cost with the old vendor:
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} - \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings.**
   - Since the vendor sells tomatoes every day, we can calculate the weekly savings by multiplying the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = \text{Daily Savings} \times 7
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching to the new vendor is:

\[
\boxed{350 \text{ dollars}}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the difference in the cost of tomatoes between the old and new vendors, and then find the weekly savings.

Given information:
- The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
- The old vendor sold tomatoes for $0.5 each.
- The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.4 each.

Step 1: Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor.
Daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor = 500 tomatoes × $0.5 per tomato = $...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching vendors, we need to calculate the cost of tomatoes from both the old and new vendors, and then find the difference.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the daily cost with the old vendor:**
   - The vendor buys 500 tomatoes a day.
   - The cost per tomato from the old vendor is $0.50.
   - Daily cost with the old vendor = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato
     \[
     \text{Daily cos...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* He sells 500 tomatoes per day
* Old price: $0.50 per tomato
* New price: $0.40 per tomato
* We need to find savings per week

2. Calculate daily cost with old vendor:
* Daily cost = 500 tomatoes × $0.50
* Daily cost = $250

3. Calculate daily cost with new vendor:
* Daily cost = 500 tomatoes × $0.40
* Daily cost = $200

4. Calculate daily savings:
* Daily savings = Old...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $.5 each and now he buys them for $.4 each. So, he saves $.5 - $.4 = $.1 per tomato.

He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he saves $.1 * 500 = $50 a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so he saves $50 * 7 = $350 a week.

Therefore, the tomato vendor saves $350 a week by switching to the new vendor.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   * The old price was $0.50 per tomato.
   * The new price is $0.40 per tomato.
   * We need to find out how much money he saves in a week.

2. Calculate the daily cost with the old vendor:
   * Daily cost (old) = Number of tomatoes sold per day × Price per tomato
   * Daily cost (old) = 500 × $0.50
   * Daily cost (old) = $250
