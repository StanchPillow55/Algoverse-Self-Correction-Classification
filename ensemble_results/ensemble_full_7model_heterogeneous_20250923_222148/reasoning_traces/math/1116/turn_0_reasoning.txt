=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate the increase in enrollment based on the previous year's enrollment.

1. **Identify the previous year's enrollment**: 
   Last year, there were 50 students enrolled.

2. **Calculate the increase in enrollment**:
   We know that this year there is a 20% increase in enrollment. To find 20% of the previous year's enrollment, we can use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Previous Enrollment} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right)
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate this year's total enrollment**:
   To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment:
   \[
   \text{This Year's Enrollment} = \text{Previous Enrollment} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{This Year's Enrollment} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is \( \boxed{60} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Last year's enrollment = 50 students
* Increase = 20%

Step 1: Convert the percentage increase to a decimal
* 20% = 20/100 = 0.20

Step 2: Calculate the increase in number of students
* Increase = Last year's enrollment × percentage increase
* Increase = 50 × 0.20
* Increase = 10 students

Step 3: Calculate this year's enrollment by adding the increase to last year's enrollment
* This year's enrollment = La...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase from last year's enrollment.

Step 1: Calculate the 20% of last year's enrollment
20% of 50 students = 20/100 * 50 = 10 students

This means that 10 more students have enrolled in the class this year compared to last year.

Step 2: Add the increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment
50 students (last year) + 10 students (increase) = 60 students

So, this year, th...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.
   * This year, there was a 20% increase in enrollment.

2. Calculate the increase in the number of students:
   * A 20% increase means we need to find 20% of the original number of students.
   * To find 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 20/100 (or 0.2).
   * 50 × 0.2 = 10
   * So, the increase in the num...
