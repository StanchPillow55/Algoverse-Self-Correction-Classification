=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the monthly electricity bill**: The total monthly electricity bill is given as $100.

2. **Calculate the monthly share for each roommate**: Since there are 4 roommates, we need to divide the total bill by the number of roommates to find out how much each person pays per month.

   \[
   \text{Monthly share per roommate} = \frac{\text{Total monthly bill}}{\text{Number of roommates}} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
   \]

   So, each roommate pays $25 per month.

3. **Calculate the yearly payment for each roommate**: To find out how much each roommate pays in a year, we need to multiply the monthly share by the number of months in a year (12 months).

   \[
   \text{Yearly payment per roommate} = \text{Monthly share per roommate} \times 12 = 25 \times 12
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   25 \times 12 = 300
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many people are sharing the bill. Jenna has 4 roommates, but we also need to include Jenna herself in the count. So, there are 5 people sharing the bill.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the electricity bill for a year. We know that the monthly bill is $100, and there are 12 months in a year. So, the total cost for a year is $100 * 12 = $1200.

Now, we need to divide this total cost equally among the 5 people. So, each person's...
