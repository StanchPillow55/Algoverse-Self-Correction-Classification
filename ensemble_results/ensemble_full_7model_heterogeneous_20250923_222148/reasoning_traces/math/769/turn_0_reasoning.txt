Final Answer: To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days of teaching, we need to break down her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Monday's Earnings

On Monday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 4
- **Hours taught**: 5

**Hourly Earnings**:
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, for 5 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Rate per Hour} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes (she taught 4), she qualifies for the additional $5 bonus for the day.

\[
\text{Daily Bonus} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Monday**:
Now, we add her hourly earnings and the daily bonus:

\[
\text{Total Earnings for Monday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Daily Bonus} = 75 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Wednesday's Earnings

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 2
- **Hours taught**: 2

**Hourly Earnings**:
Again, she earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, for 2 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Rate per Hour} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not qualify for the additional $5 bonus.

\[
\text{Daily Bonus} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Wednesday**:
Now, we add her hourly earnings and the daily bonus:

\[
\text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Daily Bonus} = 30 \, \text{dollars} + 0 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days

Now, we sum the total earnings from both days:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Earnings for Monday} + \text{Total Earnings for Wednesday} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 30 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Tanya earned a total of **$110** for the two days of teaching.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's analyze Monday first:
* Hours worked on Monday = 5 hours
* Pay rate = $15 per hour
* Number of classes = 4 classes
* Since she taught more than 3 classes, she gets the $5 bonus
* Monday's earnings = (5 hours × $15) + $5 bonus
* Monday's earnings = $75 + $5 = $80

2. Now let's calculate Wednesday:
* Hours worked on Wednesday = 2 hours
* Pay rate = $15 per hour
* Number of classes = 2 classes
* Since she taug...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns per day based on the number of hours she works.

On Monday, she works for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, she earns 5 hours * $15/hour = $<<5*15=75>>75 on Monday from her hourly wage.

On Wednesday, she works for 2 hours. So, she earns 2 hours * $15/hour = $<<2*15=30>>30 on Wednesday from her hourly wage.

Next, let's calculate the additional money she earns for teaching more than 3 classes per day.

On Monday, she teache...
