=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Determine Albert's Height**: 
   We know from the problem that Albert is 36 inches tall.

2. **Determine Anne's Height**: 
   The problem states that Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we can calculate Anne's height as follows:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine Jackie's Height After Growing**: 
   The problem states that Jackie is now 2 inches shorter than Anne. Since Anne is 72 inches tall, we can find Jackie's current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches} - 2 \text{ inches} = 70 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Determine Jackie's Height Before Summer**: 
   Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer. To find her height before summer, we subtract the growth from her current height:
   \[
   \text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Jackie's current height} - \text{growth} = 70 \text{ inches} - 3 \text{ inches} = 67 \text{ inches}
   \]

Now we have calculated Jackie's height before summer.

**Final Answer**: Jackie was 67 inches tall before summer.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackie grew 3" over the summer.
- Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne.
- Anne is twice the size of Albert.
- Albert is 36" tall.

Step 1: Find Anne's height.
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate her height as:
Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 × 36" = 72"

Step 2: Find Jackie's current height.
Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so:
Jackie's current heig...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Jackie's height before she grew 3 inches over the summer. We will work through the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Albert's Height:**
   - We are given that Albert is 36 inches tall.

2. **Determine Anne's Height:**
   - Anne is twice the size of Albert. Therefore, we calculate Anne's height as follows:
     \[
     \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Dete...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Anne's height
* We know Albert is 36" tall
* Anne is twice Albert's size
* So Anne = 36" × 2 = 72" tall

2. Now find Jackie's current height
* Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne
* So Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2"
* Jackie's current height = 72" - 2" = 70"

3. Finally, find Jackie's height before summer
* Jackie grew 3" over summer
* So her height before summer = Current height - Growt...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36" tall, Anne is 2 * 36" = 72" tall.

Now, we know that Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72" - 2" = 70" tall.

However, we know that Jackie grew 3" over the summer. So, before the summer, Jackie was 70" - 3" = 67" tall.

So, Jackie was 67" tall before the summer.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jackie grew 3" over the summer.
   * Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne.
   * Anne is twice the size of Albert.
   * Albert is 36" tall.

2. Find Anne's height:
   * Anne is twice the size of Albert.
   * Albert's height = 36"
   * Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height
   * Anne's height = 2 × 36" = 72"

3. Find Jackie's current height:
   * Jackie is now 2" shorter t...
