Final Answer: To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = Number of pairs of shorts × Cost per pair of shorts
   \[
   \text{Total cost for shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - The cost of one pair of pants is $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = Number of pairs of pants × Cost per pair of pants
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - The cost of one pair of shoes is $42.00.
   - Total cost for shoes = Number of pairs of shoes × Cost per pair of shoes
   \[
   \text{Total cost for shoes} = 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for all clothing items:**
   - Now, we add the total costs of shorts, pants, and shoes together.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for shorts} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for shoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the cost of shorts and pants:
   \[
   49.50 + 67.50 = 117.00
   \]
   - Now, add the cost of shoes:
   \[
   117.00 + 126.00 = 243.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is **$243.00**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{243.00}
\]
