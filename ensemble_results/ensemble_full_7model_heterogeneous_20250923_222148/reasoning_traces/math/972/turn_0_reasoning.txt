Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought**:
   - Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges**:
   - Each box contains 20 oranges.
   - Total number of oranges = Number of boxes × Number of oranges per box
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 12 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 240 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many boxes of oranges she gave away**:
   - Mrs. Harrington gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each.
   - Total boxes given away = 2 boxes (to mom) + 2 boxes (to sister) = 4 boxes.

4. **Calculate the number of oranges given away**:
   - Total oranges given away = Number of boxes given away × Number of oranges per box
   \[
   \text{Oranges given away} = 4 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 80 \text{ oranges}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington has left after giving some away**:
   - Oranges left = Total oranges - Oranges given away
   \[
   \text{Oranges left} = 240 \text{ oranges} - 80 \text{ oranges} = 160 \text{ oranges}
   \]

6. **Determine how many oranges Mrs. Harrington kept**:
   - She kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining oranges.
   \[
   \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times 160 \text{ oranges} = 40 \text{ oranges}
   \]

7. **Calculate how many oranges she sold**:
   - Oranges sold = Oranges left - Oranges kept
   \[
   \text{Oranges sold} = 160 \text{ oranges} - 40 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

Finally, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington had left after giving some to her mom and sister. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, so she gave away a total of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 boxes.

She initially had 12 boxes, so after giving some away, she had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so in the 8 boxes, she had 8 * 20 = <<8*20=160>>160 oranges.

She kept 1/4 of the oranges, which means she sold the rest...

Given:
- Mrs. Harrington bought 12 boxes of oranges.
- She gave her mom and her sister 2 boxes each.
- She kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges.
- Each box contains 20 oranges.

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes Mrs. Harrington has left after giving away 4 boxes.
