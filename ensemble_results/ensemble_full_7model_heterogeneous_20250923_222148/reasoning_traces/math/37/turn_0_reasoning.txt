=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Lego sets John has left after selling them and buying video games.

1. **Calculate the total money John earns from selling Lego sets:**
   - John has 13 Lego sets.
   - He sells each Lego set for $15.
   - Therefore, the total money earned from selling all Lego sets is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = \text{Number of Lego sets} \times \text{Price per Lego set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the video games:**
   - John buys 8 video games.
   - Each video game costs $20.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the video games is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = \text{Number of video games} \times \text{Price per video game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160
     \]

3. **Calculate the total money John has after buying the video games:**
   - John initially earned $195 from selling the Lego sets.
   - He spends $160 on video games.
   - After buying the video games, we can calculate how much money he has left:
     \[
     \text{Money left after buying video games} = \text{Total money from Lego sets} - \text{Total cost of video games}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money left after buying video games} = 195 - 160 = 35
     \]

4. **Check the amount of money left:**
   - According to the problem, after buying the video games, John has $5 left.
   - We calculated that he has $35 left after buying the video games, which indicates that there is a discrepancy in the problem statement.

5. **Determine how many Lego sets John has left:**
   - Since the problem states that John initially has 13 Lego sets and does not mention that he sold any of them, we can conclude that he still has all 13 Lego sets.
   - Therefore, the number of Lego sets John has left is:
     \[
     \text{Lego sets left} = 13
     \]

**Final Answer:**
John still has 13 Lego sets.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many lego sets John sold and how many he still has. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total revenue from selling lego sets:**

   John has 13 lego sets, and he sells each for $15. Therefore, if he sells all of them, the total revenue would be:
   \[
   13 \text{ lego sets} \times \$15/\text{lego set} = \$195
   \]

   John buys 8 video games, ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much money John made from selling lego sets:
* Number of lego sets = 13
* Price per set = $15
* Total money from sales = 13 × $15 = $195

2. Next, let's calculate how much he spent on video games:
* Number of video games = 8
* Price per game = $20
* Total spent on games = 8 × $20 = $160

3. Calculate money left after buying games:
* Money left = Money from sales - Money spent on games
*...
