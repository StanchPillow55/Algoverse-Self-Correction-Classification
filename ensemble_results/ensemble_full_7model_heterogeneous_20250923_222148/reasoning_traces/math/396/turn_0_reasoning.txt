Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza are left after Jenny gives some to Bill and Mark, and after she eats some herself.

1. **Total slices of pizza**: Jenny starts with a pizza that has 12 slices.

2. **Slices given to Bill**: Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Slices to Bill} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]

3. **Slices given to Mark**: Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Slices to Mark} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

4. **Total slices given away**: Now we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:
   \[
   \text{Total slices given away} = \text{Slices to Bill} + \text{Slices to Mark} = 4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
   \]

5. **Slices eaten by Jenny**: Jenny eats 2 slices of pizza. 

6. **Total slices eaten or given away**: We now find the total number of slices that have been either eaten or given away:
   \[
   \text{Total slices eaten or given away} = \text{Total slices given away} + \text{Slices eaten by Jenny} = 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ slices}
   \]

7. **Slices left**: Finally, we subtract the total slices eaten or given away from the original total number of slices:
   \[
   \text{Slices left} = \text{Total slices} - \text{Total slices eaten or given away} = 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices}
   \]

Thus, the number of slices left is \( \boxed{3} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The pizza has 12 slices total.

2. Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill.
   * 1/3 of 12 slices = 4 slices

3. Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.
   * 1/4 of 12 slices = 3 slices

4. Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

5. Now let's calculate what's left:
   * Total slices = 12
   * Slices given to Bill = 4
   * Slices given to Mark = 3 
   * Slices eaten by Jenny = 2
   * Slices left = 12 - 4 - 3 - 2 = 3 slice...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of pizza Jenny gives to Bill and Mark, how many slices she eats, and then subtract these from the total number of slices to find out how many slices are left.

1. **Total number of slices**: The pizza has 12 slices.

2. **Slices given to Bill**: Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices this is, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
   \]
   So, Bill receives 4 sl...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many slices Bill gets (1/3 of 12 slices)
   * 1/3 × 12 = 4 slices for Bill

2. Next, let's find how many slices Mark gets (1/4 of 12 slices)
   * 1/4 × 12 = 3 slices for Mark

3. We know Jenny eats 2 slices

4. Now let's add up all the slices given out:
   * Bill: 4 slices
   * Mark: 3 slices
   * Jenny: 2 slices
   * Total slices distributed = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 slices

5. To find slices remaini...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many slices Bill and Mark received. 

Bill received 1/3 of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we multiply 12 by 1/3 to find out how many slices Bill received. 

12 * 1/3 = 4 slices

Mark received 1/4 of the pizza. Again, since the pizza has 12 slices, we multiply 12 by 1/4 to find out how many slices Mark received.

12 * 1/4 = 3 slices

Jenny ate 2 slices of the pizza.

Now, we add up all the slices that were eaten or given away:

4 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The pizza has 12 slices in total.
   * Jenny gives 1/3 of the pizza to Bill.
   * Jenny gives 1/4 of the pizza to Mark.
   * Jenny eats 2 slices herself.

2. Calculate the number of slices Bill receives:
   * Bill gets 1/3 of the pizza.
   * 1/3 of 12 slices = 12 ÷ 3 = 4 slices
   * So, Bill receives 4 slices.

3. Calculate the number of slices Mark receives:
