=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the ages of each person mentioned and ultimately finding the age of Steve's son's wife.

1. **Determine Steve's Age:**
   - Steve is given as 60 years old.

2. **Determine Steve's Wife's Age:**
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, her age is:
     \[
     \text{Steve's wife's age} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Their Son's Age:**
   - Their son is currently half as old as his mom (Steve's wife).
   - Since Steve's wife is 64 years old, their son's age is:
     \[
     \text{Son's age} = \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Steve's Son's Wife's Age:**
   - Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (Steve's son).
   - Therefore, her age is:
     \[
     \text{Son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
     \]

Now that we have calculated all the necessary ages, we can state the final answer.

**Final Answer:**
Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Steve is 60 years old.
- Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
- Their son is currently half as old as his mom.
- Their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband.

Step 1: Find the age of Steve's wife.

Steve's wife's age = 60 + 4 = 64 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Steve's son.
Steve's son's age = Steve's wife's age / 2
Steve's son's a...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Steve's son's wife. We'll break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Steve's wife's age:**
   - Steve is 60 years old.
   - His wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, Steve's wife is \(60 + 4 = 64\) years old.

2. **Determine the son's age:**
   - The son is currently half as old as his mom.
   - Steve's wife (the son's mom) is 64 years old.
   - Therefore, the son is \(\frac{64}{2} = 32\) years ol...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Steve's wife's age:
* Steve is 60 years old
* His wife is 4 years older
* So, Steve's wife = 60 + 4 = 64 years old

2. Next, let's find their son's age:
* Son is half as old as his mom
* Mom (Steve's wife) is 64 years old
* So, son's age = 64 รท 2 = 32 years old

3. Finally, let's find son's wife's age:
* Son is 32 years old
* Son's wife is 3 years younger than him
* So, son's wife's age = 32 - 3...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how old Steve's wife is. Since she is 4 years older than Steve, we add 4 to Steve's age:

60 years (Steve's age) + 4 years = 64 years old (Steve's wife's age)

Next, we find out how old their son is. Since he is half as old as his mom, we divide his mom's age by 2:

64 years (Steve's wife's age) / 2 = 32 years old (their son's age)

Finally, we find out how old the son's wife is. Since she is 3 years younger than her husband, we subtract 3 from the s...
