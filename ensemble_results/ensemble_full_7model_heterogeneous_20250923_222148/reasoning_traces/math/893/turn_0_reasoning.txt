Final Answer: To find out how much Mark makes in a week after his pay raise, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Mark's new hourly wage**: 
   - Mark's previous hourly wage was $10.
   - His pay was raised by $2 per hour.
   - Therefore, his new hourly wage is:
     \[
     10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total hours Mark works in a week**:
   - Mark works 8 hours a day.
   - He works 5 days a week.
   - Thus, the total hours he works in a week is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate Mark's weekly earnings**:
   - Now that we know his new hourly wage and the total hours he works, we can calculate his weekly earnings.
   - His weekly earnings can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Total Hours Worked}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} = 480 \text{ dollars/week}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Mark makes **$480 a week** after his pay raise.

In conclusion, Mark's weekly earnings after the raise is \(\boxed{480}\) dollars.
