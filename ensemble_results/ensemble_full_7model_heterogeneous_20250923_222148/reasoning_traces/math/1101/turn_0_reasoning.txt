Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Ahito ran given the total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito.

1. **Identify the distances run by Amber and Micah**:
   - Amber ran 8 miles.
   - Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Therefore, we can calculate Micah's distance as follows:
     \[
     \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times \text{Amber's distance} = 3.5 \times 8
     \]

2. **Calculate Micah's distance**:
   \[
   \text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance run by Amber and Micah**:
   - Now we add the distances run by Amber and Micah:
     \[
     \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = \text{Amber's distance} + \text{Micah's distance} = 8 + 28
     \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 36 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine the distance run by Ahito**:
   - We know the total distance run by all three runners is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total distance run by Amber and Micah from the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Ahito's distance} = \text{Total distance} - \text{Total distance by Amber and Micah} = 52 - 36
     \]
   \[
   \text{Ahito's distance} = 16 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of miles Ahito ran is:
   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles.
- Amber ran 8 miles.
- Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Step 1: Calculate how many miles Micah ran.
Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.
Amber ran 8 miles.
Therefore, Micah ran 3.5 × 8 = 28 miles.

Step 2: Calculate how many miles Ahito ran.
The total miles run by the three of them is 52 miles.
Amber ran 8 miles, and Micah ran 28 miles.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Ahito ran, given the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Total miles run by all three:** 52 miles
2. **Miles run by Amber:** 8 miles
3. **Miles run by Micah:** 3.5 times what Amber ran

First, we calculate how many miles Micah ran. Since Micah ran 3.5 times the distance Amber ran, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Miles run by Micah} = 3.5 \t...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total miles run = 52 miles
* Amber ran 8 miles
* Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran

2. Let's calculate how many miles Micah ran:
* Micah's miles = 3.5 × Amber's miles
* Micah's miles = 3.5 × 8
* Micah's miles = 28 miles

3. Now we can find Ahito's miles:
* Total miles = Amber's miles + Micah's miles + Ahito's miles
* 52 = 8 + 28 + Ahito's miles
* 52 = 36 + Ahito's miles
* Ah...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Amber ran 8 miles, so we multiply 8 by 3.5:

8 miles * 3.5 = 28 miles

So, Micah ran 28 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. We know that the total miles ran by all three is 52 miles. We subtract the miles ran by Amber and Micah from the total:

52 miles - 8 miles - 28 miles = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of 52 miles.
- Amber ran 8 miles.
- Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran.

Step 1: Calculate the number of miles Micah ran.
Micah's miles = 3.5 × Amber's miles
Micah's miles = 3.5 × 8 = 28 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total miles run by Amber and Micah.
Amber and Micah's total miles = Amber's miles + Micah's miles
Amber and Micah's total miles = 8 + 28 = 36 miles
