=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles that Brianna's family has when the power goes out.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights
There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Number of people} = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flashlights for the rooms
There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights. Therefore, the total number of flashlights for the rooms is:

\[
\text{Flashlights for rooms} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Flashlights per room} = 8 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of flashlights
Now we add the flashlights carried by the people to the flashlights in the rooms:

\[
\text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights carried by people} + \text{Flashlights for rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of candles
The problem states that there are two types of candles: small candles and medium candles. Half of the rooms have small candles, and the other half have medium candles.

#### Small candles:
- Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
- Therefore, the total number of small candles is:

\[
\text{Total small candles} = \text{Number of small candle rooms} \times \text{Small candles per room} = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

#### Medium candles:
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.
- Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:

\[
\text{Total medium candles} = \text{Number of medium candle rooms} \times \text{Medium candles per room} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of candles
Now we add the total number of small candles and medium candles:

\[
\text{Total candles} = \text{Total small candles} + \text{Total medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of candles and flashlights combined
Finally, we add the total number of candles to the total number of flashlights:

\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total candles} + \text{Total flashlights} = 36 + 20 = 56
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of candles and flashlights that Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:

\[
\boxed{56}
\]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of flashlights:
   * Flashlights per person = 1 × 4 people = 4 flashlights
   * Flashlights per room = 2 × 8 rooms = 16 flashlights
   * Total flashlights = 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights

2. Next, let's calculate the candles:
   * Half of the rooms = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 rooms
   * Small candles: 
     * 4 candles × 4 rooms = 16 small candles
   * Medium candles:
     * 5 candles × 4 rooms = 20 medium...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, and each person has a flashlight. So, there are 4 flashlights for the people. 

Next, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms. So, there are 2*8 = 16 flashlights for the rooms.

Adding these together, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights in total.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, and the other half have 5 medium candles ...
