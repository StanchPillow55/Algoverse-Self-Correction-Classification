=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many shells Robert collects on Monday:**
   - According to the problem, Robert collects 20 shells on Monday.

2. **Calculate how many shells Kylie collects on Monday:**
   - The problem states that Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. Since Robert collects 20 shells, we can calculate Kylie's collection as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = \text{Robert's shells} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]
   So, Kylie collects 25 shells on Monday.

3. **Determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday:**
   - The problem states that Kylie collects 2 times more shells on Tuesday than she did on Monday. Therefore, we calculate Kylie's collection on Tuesday as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kylie's shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Kylie's shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.

Thus, the final answer is that Kylie collects **50 shells on Tuesday**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): On Monday, Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert. Since Robert collects 20 shells, Kylie collects 20 + 5 = <<20+5=25>>25 shells on Monday.

On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday. This means she collects 2 * 25 = <<2*25=50>>50 shells on Tuesday.

So, Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.
