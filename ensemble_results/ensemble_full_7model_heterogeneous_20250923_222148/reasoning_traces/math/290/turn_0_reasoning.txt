=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has.**
   - We know that Ali has won 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, the number of medals Izzy has is:
     \[
     \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together.**
   - We add the number of medals Ali has to the number of medals Izzy has:
     \[
     \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39
     \]

3. **Determine how many medals have been given out for counting.**
   - According to the problem, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together.
   - Therefore, we calculate the total number of medals given out as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - The total number of medals that have been given out for counting is:
     \[
     \boxed{390}
     \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of medals that have been given out for counting.

Given information:
- Ali has won 22 medals for counting super fast.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Together, Ali and Izzy have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting.

Step 1: Find the number of medals Izzy has.
Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17 medals

Step 2: Find the total number of medals Al...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of medals that have been given out for counting, based on the information about Ali and Izzy's medals.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Ali's Medals**: Ali has won 22 medals.

2. **Izzy's Medals**: Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali. Therefore, the number of medals Izzy has is:
   \[
   \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17
   \]

3. **Total Medals for Ali and Izzy**: The total...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Ali has 22 medals
* Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali
* Together they have 10 times less medals than total medals given out

2. Let's find how many medals Izzy has:
* Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
* Izzy's medals = 22 - 5 = 17 medals

3. Let's find the total medals Ali and Izzy have together:
* Combined medals = Ali's medals + Izzy's medals
* Combined medals = 22 + 17 = 39 m...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we subtract 5 from 22. 

22 - 5 = 17 medals

So, Izzy has 17 medals.

Next, we need to figure out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together. To do this, we add the number of medals Ali has to the number of medals Izzy has.

22 + 17 = 39 medals

So, Ali and Izzy together have 39 medals.

The problem tells us that the total number of medals given out for cou...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll follow the problem-solving steps to find the solution.

Given:
- Ali has won 22 medals for counting.
- Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
- Together, they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting.

Step 1: Calculate the number of medals Izzy has.
Izzy's medals = Ali's medals - 5
