=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define some variables and work through the information step by step.

Let:
- \( S \) = the amount of water (in gallons) in the small pool now.
- \( B \) = the amount of water (in gallons) in the big pool now.

### Step 1: Understand the leak rate
Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Since we are looking at the situation 4 minutes ago, we need to account for the water that has leaked out of both pools during that time.

In 4 minutes, the amount of water lost from each pool is:
\[
\text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amounts of water 4 minutes ago
Four minutes ago, the amount of water in the small pool was:
\[
S + 16 \text{ gallons}
\]
And the amount of water in the big pool was:
\[
B + 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equations based on the problem statement
According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
\[
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

Now, we simplify this equation:
\[
B + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
B = 2S + 32 - 16
\]
\[
B = 2S + 16 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

### Step 4: Use the current relationship between the pools
The problem also states that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[
B = 4S \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

### Step 5: Solve the system of equations
Now we have two equations:
1. \( B = 2S + 16 \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

We can set these equations equal to each other:
\[
2S + 16 = 4S
\]

Now, we will solve for \( S \):
\[
16 = 4S - 2S
\]
\[
16 = 2S
\]
\[
S = \frac{16}{2} = 8
\]

### Step 6: Find the amount of water in the big pool
Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( B \) using Equation 2:
\[
B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32
\]

### Step 7: Verify the solution
Let's verify the conditions:
- Four minutes ago, the small pool had:
\[
S + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ gallons}
\]
- Four minutes ago, the big pool had:
\[
B + 16 = 32 + 16 = 48 \text{ gallons}
\]
- Check the relationship:
\[
48 = 2 \times 24 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

Now, currently:
- The small pool has \( S = 8 \) gallons.
- The big pool has \( B = 32 \) gallons.
- Check the current relationship:
\[
32 = 4 \times 8 \quad \text{(True)}
\]

### Final Answer
The amount of water in the small pool now is:
\[
\boxed{8} \text{ gallons}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations and solve for the amount of water in the small pool.

Given information:
- Both pools have leaks that are emptying them at a rate of 4 gallons/minute.
- 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
- Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
- Let y...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the current amount of water in the small pool.

Let's define:
- \( B(t) \) as the amount of water in the big pool at time \( t \).
- \( S(t) \) as the amount of water in the small pool at time \( t \).

We know:
1. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
2. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four ti...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's say the small pool currently has x gallons
   * Then the big pool currently has 4x gallons (since it has 4 times as much now)

2) 4 minutes ago:
   * Small pool had: x + (4 gallons/min × 4 min) = x + 16 gallons
   * Big pool had: 4x + (4 gallons/min × 4 min) = 4x + 16 gallons

3) We know 4 minutes ago the big pool had twice as much as the small pool
   * So: 4x + 16 = 2(x + 16)
   * 4x + 16 = 2x + 32
   * 4...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as x (in gallons). 

Since the pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was x + 4*4 = x + 16 gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2*(x + 16) = 2x + 32 gallons.

Now, 4 minutes later, the big pool has lost water at a rate of 4...
