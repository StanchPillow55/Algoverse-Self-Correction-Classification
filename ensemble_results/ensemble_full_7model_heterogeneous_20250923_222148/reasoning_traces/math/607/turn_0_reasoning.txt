=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash instead of the recommended 2 pumps.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of washes per bottle

The directions state that using 2 pumps of shampoo provides 120 washes. Therefore, we can calculate how many washes can be achieved with 1 pump:

\[
\text{Washes per pump} = \frac{120 \text{ washes}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washes per pump}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of washes with 1 pump

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the total number of washes she can get from the jumbo bottle is equal to the number of washes per pump:

\[
\text{Total washes} = 120 \text{ washes} \quad (\text{since she uses 1 pump per wash})
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the shampoo in cents

The cost of the jumbo bottle of shampoo is $24.00. To convert this amount into cents:

\[
\text{Cost in cents} = 24.00 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ cents}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost per wash

Now, we need to find the cost per wash. Since Jackie can get 120 washes from the bottle, we calculate the cost per wash:

\[
\text{Cost per wash} = \frac{\text{Total cost in cents}}{\text{Total washes}} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ washes}} = 20 \text{ cents per wash}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the cost per pump

Since Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, the cost per pump is the same as the cost per wash:

\[
\text{Cost per pump} = 20 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the cost of each pump of shampoo, when Jackie uses 1 pump per wash, is:

\[
\boxed{20} \text{ cents}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash, and this will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash.

To find the cost per pump, we need to:
1. Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
2. Calculate the cost per pump.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost per pump of shampoo when Jackie uses only 1 pump per wash. Let's go through the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
   - Using 2 pumps per wash gives 120 washings.

2. **Calculate the total number of pumps in the bottle:**
   - If 2 pumps are used per wash and this allows for 120 washings, then the total number of pumps in the bottle is:
     \[...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Bottle costs $24.00
* Normal use is 2 pumps = 120 washings
* Jackie uses 1 pump per wash

2. Let's find how many total pumps are in the bottle:
* If 2 pumps gives 120 washings
* Then total pumps = 120 washings × 2 pumps
* Total pumps = 240 pumps

3. Now we can find the cost per pump:
* Cost per pump = Total cost ÷ Total pumps
* Cost per pump = $24.00 ÷ 240 pumps
* Cost...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many pumps are in the jumbo bottle of shampoo. The directions say that 2 pumps are used for one washing, and the bottle gives 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 2 pumps/washing * 120 washings = 240 pumps.

Next, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps. So, $24.00 / 240 pumps = $0.10/pump.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break down the problem and solve it step by step:

Given:
- The jumbo bottle of shampoo costs $24.00.
- The directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo per wash.
- Using 2 pumps per wash will give you 120 washings.
- Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash.

Step 1: Determine the total number of pumps in the jumbo bottle.
If 2 pumps give you 120 washings, then the total number of pumps in the bottle is:
Total pumps = 2 pumps per wash × 120 washings
