=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of clouds Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that she starts with 3 clouds on Monday and sees double the number of clouds each subsequent day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: 
   - Alice counts 3 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 3.

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   - Clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) = 9.

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   - Clouds on Wednesday = 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 9 (previous total) + 12 (Wednesday) = 21.

4. **Thursday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   - Clouds on Thursday = 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 21 (previous total) + 24 (Thursday) = 45.

5. **Friday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   - Clouds on Friday = 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 45 (previous total) + 48 (Friday) = 93.

Now, let's summarize the total number of clouds counted each day:

- Monday: 3 clouds
- Tuesday: 6 clouds
- Wednesday: 12 clouds
- Thursday: 24 clouds
- Friday: 48 clouds

Finally, we add up all the clouds counted over the week:

Total clouds = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93 clouds.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Alice will have counted a total of 93 clouds at lunch across all five days.**

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of clouds Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, given that she starts with 3 clouds on Monday and sees double the number of clouds each subsequent day.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**: 
   - Alice counts 3 clouds.
   - Total clouds counted so far = 3.

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   - Clouds on Tuesday = 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.
   - Total clouds count...

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Monday, Alice counted 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday through Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before.

To find the total number of clouds counted across all five days, we need to calculate the number of clouds for each day and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of clouds for each day.
Monday: 3 clouds
Tuesday: 3 × 2 = 6 clouds
Wednesday: ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of clouds Alice counts each day from Monday through Friday and then sum these amounts to find the total number of clouds she counts during the week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Monday:**
   - Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Each day, the number of clouds doubles from the previous day.
   - Therefore, on Tuesday, Alice counts \(2 \times 3 = 6\) puffs of clouds.

3. **Wednesd...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's track the clouds each day:
   * Monday: 3 clouds
   * Tuesday: 3 × 2 = 6 clouds (double Monday)
   * Wednesday: 6 × 2 = 12 clouds (double Tuesday)
   * Thursday: 12 × 2 = 24 clouds (double Wednesday)
   * Friday: 24 × 2 = 48 clouds (double Thursday)

2. To find the total clouds counted across all days, add them up:
   * Total = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday
   * Total = 3 + 6 + 12 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem day by day.

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so she counts 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she counts 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she counts 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she counts 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day and then add them together to get the total for the week.

Given:
- On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
- Each day after Monday through Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as the day before.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cloud puffs for each day.
Monday: 3 puffs
Tuesday: 3 × 2 = 6 puffs (doubling Monday's count)
Wednesday: ...
