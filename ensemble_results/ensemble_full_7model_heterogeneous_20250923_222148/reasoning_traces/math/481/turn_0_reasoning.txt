Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of both the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny, and then find their combined weight.

1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny**: 
   We are given that the weight of the 1959 penny is 48 grains.

2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny**: 
   According to the problem, the 2010 penny weighs three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. We can calculate the weight of the 2010 penny using the following formula:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny}
   \]

   Substituting the weight of the 1959 penny:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3 \times 48}{4}
   \]

   First, calculate \(3 \times 48\):

   \[
   3 \times 48 = 144
   \]

   Now, divide by 4:

   \[
   \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Therefore, the weight of the 2010 penny is 36 grains.

3. **Calculate the combined weight of the two pennies**: 
   Now that we have the weights of both pennies, we can find the combined weight:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny}
   \]

   Substituting the weights we found:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Now, perform the addition:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The combined weight of the two pennies is 

   \[
   \boxed{84} \text{ grains}.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Belen has a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny.
- The 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
- The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

Step 1: Find the weight of the 2010 penny.
Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we can calculate its weight as follows:
Weight of the 2010 penny = 3/4 × Weight of the 1959 penny
Weight of the 2010 penny = 3/4 × 48 gr...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the weight of each penny and then find their combined weight.

1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny:**
   - We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny:**
   - The problem states that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
   - To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate three-quarters of 48 grains.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains
* The 2010 penny is three-quarters (¾) of the weight of the 1959 penny

2. Let's find the weight of the 2010 penny:
* 2010 penny = ¾ × 1959 penny weight
* 2010 penny = ¾ × 48 grains
* 2010 penny = 36 grains

3. Now we can find the combined weight by adding both pennies:
* Combined weight = 1959 penny + 2010 penny
* Combined weight = 48 grains +...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much the 2010 penny weighs. We know that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

To find this, we multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by three-quarters:

48 grains * 3/4 = 36 grains

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Next, we need to find the combined weight of the two pennies. To do this, we add the weight of the 1959 penny to the weight of the 2010 penny:

48 grains + 36 grains = 84 grains

So, the combined weight of ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Belen has two pennies: a 2010 penny and a 1959 penny.
   * The 2010 penny weighs three-quarters (3/4) of the weight of the 1959 penny.
   * The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:
   * Weight of 2010 penny = 3/4 × Weight of 1959 penny
