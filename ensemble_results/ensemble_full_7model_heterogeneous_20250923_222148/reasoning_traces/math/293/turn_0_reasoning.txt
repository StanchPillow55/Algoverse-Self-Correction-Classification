=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the points of each player after the first three rounds, and then we will calculate their points after the fourth round where extra points are distributed.

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike. Therefore, Jim's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Jim's points} = \text{Mike's points} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Therefore, Tony's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times \text{Mike's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
     \]

2. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike: 21 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 42 points

3. **Total points after 3 rounds:**
   We can calculate the total points of all three players:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Mike's points} + \text{Jim's points} + \text{Tony's points} = 21 + 18 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 81
   \]

4. **Distribution of extra points in the fourth round:**
   According to the problem, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. We will check each player's points:
   - Mike has 21 points (over 20), so he gets 1 extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points (not over 20), so he does not get any extra points.
   - Tony has 42 points (over 20), so he gets 1 extra point.

5. **Points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's new total: 
     \[
     21 + 1 = 22
     \]
   - Jim's new total: 
     \[
     18 + 0 = 18
     \]
   - Tony's new total: 
     \[
     42 + 1 = 43
     \]

6. **Final points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

7. **Final total points after the fourth round:**
   We can calculate the final total points:
   \[
   \text{Final total points} = \text{Mike's new points} + \text{Jim's new points} + \text{Tony's new points} = 22 + 18 + 43
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final total points} = 83
   \]

Thus, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points have been distributed is \( \boxed{83} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will first determine the points of each player after the first three rounds, and then we will calculate their points after the fourth round where extra points are distributed.

1. **Points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike. Therefore, Jim's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Jim's points} = \text{Mike's points} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds.
Tony's points = 2 × M...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the points each player has after the fourth round, including any extra points they receive for having over 20 points. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Initial Points Calculation

1. **Mike's Points:**
   - Mike has 21 points after 3 rounds.

2. **Jim's Points:**
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
   - Therefore, Jim's points = Mike's points - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18 points.

3. **Tony's Points:**
   - Tony has 2 times...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the initial points for each player:
* Mike has 21 points
* Jim has 3 points less than Mike: 21 - 3 = 18 points
* Tony has 2 times more than Mike: 21 × 2 = 42 points

2. Now, let's determine who gets an extra point in round 4:
* Mike has 21 points (>20) → gets +1 point
* Jim has 18 points (≤20) → gets no extra point
* Tony has 42 points (>20) → gets +1 point

3. Let's calculate final points a...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by calculating the points each player has before the extra points are distributed.

Mike has 21 points.

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points.

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 21 * 2 = 42 points.

Now, let's see who gets the extra points. The problem states that every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. 

Mike has 21 points, which is over 20, so he gets an extra point, bringing his total to 21 + 1 ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- There are three friends: Mike, Jim, and Tony.
- After 3 rounds, Mike has 21 points.
- Jim has 3 points less than Mike.
- Tony has 2 times more points than Mike.
- In the fourth round, every player with over 20 points gets an extra point.

Step 1: Calculate Jim's points after 3 rounds.
Jim's points = Mike's points - 3
Jim's points = 21 - 3 = 18 points

Step 2: Calculate Tony's points after 3 rounds....
