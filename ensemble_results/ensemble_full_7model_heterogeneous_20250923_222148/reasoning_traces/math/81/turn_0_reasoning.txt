Final Answer: To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we will go through the problem step by step, performing calculations at each stage.

1. **Initial Stickers**: Charlie starts with 10 stickers.
   \[
   \text{Initial stickers} = 10
   \]

2. **Stickers Bought**: Charlie buys 21 stickers from a store.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after purchase} = 10 + 21 = 31
   \]

3. **Birthday Stickers**: Charlie receives 23 stickers for his birthday.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after birthday} = 31 + 23 = 54
   \]

4. **Giving Stickers to Sister**: Charlie gives 9 stickers to his sister.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after giving to sister} = 54 - 9 = 45
   \]

5. **Using Stickers for Decoration**: Charlie uses 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.
   \[
   \text{Stickers after decorating} = 45 - 28 = 17
   \]

Now, we have calculated each step and found that Charlie has 17 stickers left after all transactions.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Charlie started with 10 stickers
* He bought 21 stickers at the mall
* He got 23 stickers for his birthday
* He gave 9 stickers to his sister
* He used 28 stickers for a greeting card

2. Let's add up all the stickers Charlie received:
* Initial stickers: 10
* Mall stickers: + 21

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He then bought 21 more, which makes 10 + 21 = <<10+21=31>>31 stickers.

Charlie also got 23 stickers for his birthday, so he now has 31 + 23 = <<31+23=54>>54 stickers.

Charlie then gave 9 stickers to his sister, which leaves him with 54 - 9 = <<54-9=45>>45 stickers.

Finally, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card. This leaves him with 45 - 28 = <<45-28=17>>17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.
