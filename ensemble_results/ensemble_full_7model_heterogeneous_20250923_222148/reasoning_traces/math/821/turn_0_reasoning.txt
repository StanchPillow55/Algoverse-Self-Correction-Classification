=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Cars**: 
   Hunter counted 50 cars when he entered the school parking lot.

   \[
   \text{Initial Count} = 50
   \]

2. **Cars Added During First Break**: 
   During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. We need to add this to the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Count after First Break} = \text{Initial Count} + \text{Cars Added} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Cars Leaving During Lunch Break**: 
   When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars in the parking lot had left. We need to calculate how many cars left.

   \[
   \text{Cars that left} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Count after First Break} = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]

4. **Total Cars Remaining During Lunch Break**: 
   To find the total number of cars remaining in the parking lot during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the count after the first break.

   \[
   \text{Count during Lunch Break} = \text{Count after First Break} - \text{Cars that left} = 70 - 35 = 35
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
2. Calculate the number of cars that left during the lunch break.
3. Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cars in the parking lot after the first break.
Initial number of cars = 50
Number of cars added during the first break = 20
Total numb...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Count:**
   - Hunter initially counted 50 cars in the parking lot when he entered class in the morning.

2. **First Break:**
   - During the first break, he counted 20 more cars in the parking lot. This means 20 additional cars arrived after his initial count.
   - To find the total number of cars in the parking lot during the first break, we add the initi...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of cars before any left:
* Initial cars in morning = 50 cars
* Cars added during first break = 20 cars
* Total cars = 50 + 20 = 70 cars

2. During lunch break, 1/2 of the cars had gone:
* To find remaining cars, I need to divide total cars by 2
* 70 รท 2 = 35 cars

Therefore, during lunch break, Hunter counted 35 cars in the parking lot.

To verify:
* Started with 50 cars
* Added...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break is the sum of the cars Hunter counted when he entered class and the cars he counted during the first break. 

So, the total number of cars before the lunch break is 50 cars + 20 cars = 70 cars.

During the lunch break, half of the cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that the number of cars left is half of the total number of cars before the lunch break.

So, the number of cars Hunter counted durin...
