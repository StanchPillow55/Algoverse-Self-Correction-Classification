Final Answer: To determine how much change Adam received after buying candies, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type A**:
   - Adam bought 7 candies of type A.
   - The cost of one candy of type A is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type A} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of candies of type B**:
   - Adam bought 10 candies of type B.
   - The cost of one candy of type B is $0.75.
   - Therefore, the total cost for type B candies is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for type B} = \text{Number of candies} \times \text{Cost per candy} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.5
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all candies**:
   - Now, we add the total costs of type A and type B candies:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for type A} + \text{Total cost for type B} = 3.5 + 7.5 = 11.0
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Adam received**:
   - Adam paid the cashier $15.
   - To find out how much change he received, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost} = 15 - 11.0 = 4.0
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Adam received **$4.00** in change.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.
- One candy of type A costs $0.5, and one candy of type B costs $0.75.
- Adam paid the cashier $15.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the candies.
Cost of 7 candies of type A = 7 × $0.5 = $3.5
Cost of 10 candies of type B = 10 × $0.75 = $7.5
Total cost of the candies = $3.5 + $7.5 = $11

Step 2: Calculate the change Adam received.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought and then determine how much change he received from the cashier after paying with $15.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of type A candies.**

Adam bought 7 candies of type A, and each candy costs $0.5. Therefore, the total cost for type A candies is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of type A candies} = 7 \times 0.5 = 3.5
\]

So, the total cost for type A candies is $3.50.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of type A candies:
* Cost per candy A = $0.50
* Number of type A candies = 7
* Total cost of A = $0.50 × 7 = $3.50

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of type B candies:
* Cost per candy B = $0.75
* Number of type B candies = 10
* Total cost of B = $0.75 × 10 = $7.50

3. Calculate the total cost of all candies:
* Total cost = Cost of A + Cost of B
* Total cost = $3.50 + $7.50 = $11....

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought.

The cost of type A candies is calculated by multiplying the number of candies by the cost of each candy. So, 7 candies of type A cost 7 * $0.5 = $3.5.

Similarly, the cost of type B candies is 10 * $0.75 = $7.5.

To find the total cost of all candies, we add the cost of type A candies and type B candies. So, the total cost is $3.5 + $7.5 = $11.

Adam paid the cashier $15. To find out how much change h...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Adam bought 7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.
   * Each candy of type A costs $0.5.
   * Each candy of type B costs $0.75.
   * Adam paid the cashier $15.

2. Calculate the total cost of type A candies:
   * Cost of type A candies = Number of type A candies × Price per type A candy
   * Cost of type A candies = 7 × $0.5
   * Cost of type A candies = $3.5...
