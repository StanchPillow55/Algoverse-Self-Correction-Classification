Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips and then determine how much Julieta received based on the information given.

1. **Calculate Rafaela's Tips:**
   - Each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip.
   - To find the total tips Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the amount of each tip:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = \text{Number of customers} \times \text{Tip per customer}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800
     \]
   - So, Rafaela received **$800** in tips.

2. **Calculate Julieta's Tips:**
   - Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela.
   - First, we need to find out what 10% of Rafaela's tips is:
     \[
     \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find out how much Julieta received:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Julieta} = \text{Total tips for Rafaela} - \text{10% of Rafaela's tips}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720
     \]
   - So, Julieta received **$720** in tips.

3. **Calculate the Total Tips for Both:**
   - Now, we need to find the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for both} = \text{Total tips for Rafaela} + \text{Total tips for Julieta}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is **$1520**. 

Final answer: **$1520**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips
* 40 customers each gave her a $20 tip
* Total for Rafaela = 40 × $20
* Total for Rafaela = $800

2. Now let's calculate Julieta's tips
* She received 10% less than Rafaela
* 10% of $800 = $800 × 0.10 = $80
* So Julieta received $800 - $80 = $720

3. To find their combined tips, add their totals together
* Combined tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's ti...
