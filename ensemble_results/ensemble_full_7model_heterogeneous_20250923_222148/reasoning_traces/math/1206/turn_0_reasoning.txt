Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the loan amount based on the value of the house.**
2. **Determine how much of the loan is used to pay off debts.**
3. **Calculate the leftover amount after paying off debts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Loan Amount

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 40\% \text{ of } 250,000
\]

To calculate 40% of $250,000, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
40\% = 0.40
\]

Now, we multiply:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

So, the loan amount is **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Determine How Much is Used to Pay Off Debts

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 60\% \text{ of } 100,000
\]

Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
60\% = 0.60
\]

Now, we multiply:

\[
\text{Amount Used for Debts} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate the Leftover Amount

To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount used for debts from the total loan amount.

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Amount Used for Debts}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Leftover Amount} = 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
\]

Thus, the amount of money John has leftover after paying off his debts is **$40,000**.

### Final Answer

John has **$40,000** leftover after paying off his debts.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John's house is worth $250,000.
2. He gets a loan worth 40% of that:
   * 40% of $250,000 = 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000

3. He uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts:
   * 60% of $100,000 = 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000

4. To find the amount of money he had leftover after paying off his debts, we need to subtract the amount used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
   * $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the loan amount John receives.**
   - The house is worth $250,000.
   - John gets a loan worth 40% of the house's value.

   To find 40% of $250,000, we calculate:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the amount of the loan (40% of house value)
* House value = $250,000
* Loan percentage = 40%
* Loan amount = $250,000 × 40% = $250,000 × 0.40 = $100,000

2. Next, let's calculate how much goes to debt (60% of loan)
* Debt payment percentage = 60%
* Debt payment = $100,000 × 60% = $100,000 × 0.60 = $60,000

3. Finally, let's calculate money leftover
* Money leftover = Loan amount - Debt payment

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much John gets from the loan. The loan is worth 40% of his house's value. 

To calculate this, we multiply the value of the house by the percentage of the loan:

$250,000 * 40/100 = $100,000

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan John uses to pay off his debts. He uses 60% of the loan to do this.

To calculate this, we multiply the value of the loan by the percentage used to pay off debts:
