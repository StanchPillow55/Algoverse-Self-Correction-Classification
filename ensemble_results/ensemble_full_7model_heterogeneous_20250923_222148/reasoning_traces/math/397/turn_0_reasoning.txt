=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many days Mark needs to save money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the current amount Mark has:**
   - Mark currently has $50 in his bank account.

2. **Identify the cost of the bike:**
   - The bike costs $300.

3. **Calculate how much more money Mark needs:**
   - To find out how much more money he needs, we subtract the amount he currently has from the cost of the bike:
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of bike} - \text{Current amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 300 - 50 = 250
   \]
   So, Mark needs an additional $250.

4. **Identify how much Mark earns per day:**
   - Mark earns $10 per day.

5. **Calculate how many days it will take for Mark to save the additional amount needed:**
   - To find out how many days he needs to work to earn the additional $250, we divide the amount needed by the amount he earns per day:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Earnings per day}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Thus, Mark needs to work for **25 days** to save enough money to buy the bike.

**Final Answer:**
Mark has to save money for **25 days**.

This means Mark needs to save $250 more to buy the bike.

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Mark to save this amount. Since Mark earns $10 per day, we divide the total amount he needs to save ...
