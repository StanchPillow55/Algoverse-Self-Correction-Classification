=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many birds are attracted to Lillian's garden based on the bird feeders she has built and bought.

1. **Identify the number of feeders**:
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total number of feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder**:
   - Each bird feeder attracts 20 birds throughout the day.
   - However, Lillian's homemade feeders attract 10 more birds than the store-bought ones.
   - Let's denote the number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, the homemade feeders attract \( x + 10 \) birds.

3. **Set up the equations**:
   - We know that the store-bought feeders attract 20 birds:
     \[
     x = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the homemade feeders attract:
     \[
     x + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted**:
   - Lillian has 3 homemade feeders, each attracting 30 birds:
     \[
     \text{Total from homemade feeders} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]
   - Lillian has 3 store-bought feeders, each attracting 20 birds:
     \[
     \text{Total from store-bought feeders} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ birds}
     \]

5. **Combine the totals**:
   - Total number of birds attracted to all feeders:
     \[
     \text{Total birds} = 90 + 60 = 150 \text{ birds}
     \]

Thus, Lillian can expect to see **150 birds** in her garden each day.

**Final Answer**: 150 birds.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Lillian has a total of 6 bird feeders in her garden, 3 of which she made herself and 3 she bought from the store.

The store-bought bird feeders attract 20 birds each. Since there are 3 of them, they attract a total of 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 birds.

The bird feeders Lillian made herself attract 10 more birds each than the store-bought ones. This means they attract 20 + 10 = <<20+10=30>>30 birds each.

Since there are 3 bird feeders that Lillian made, they attract a total ...
