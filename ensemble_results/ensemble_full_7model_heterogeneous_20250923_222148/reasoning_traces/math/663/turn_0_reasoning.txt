=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we can start by setting up the information we have:

1. Total newspapers delivered in a day: **600**
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: **198**
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: **209**
4. Newspapers delivered to District B: **?** (this is what we need to find)

We can express the total number of newspapers delivered as the sum of the newspapers delivered to each district:

\[
\text{Total newspapers} = \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District B} + \text{Newspapers to District C}
\]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we have:

\[
600 = 198 + \text{Newspapers to District B} + 209
\]

Next, we can simplify the equation by first adding the newspapers delivered to District A and District C:

\[
198 + 209 = 407
\]

Now we can substitute this sum back into the equation:

\[
600 = 407 + \text{Newspapers to District B}
\]

To find the number of newspapers delivered to District B, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 407 from both sides:

\[
\text{Newspapers to District B} = 600 - 407
\]

Now we perform the subtraction:

\[
600 - 407 = 193
\]

Thus, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is **193**.

In conclusion, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{193}
\]
