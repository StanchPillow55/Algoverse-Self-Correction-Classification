=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much change Violetta will receive after buying the crayons, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of the crayons**:
   - Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
   - Each crayon costs $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Crayons} \times \text{Cost per Crayon}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the change Violetta will receive**:
   - Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase.
   - To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she has:
     \[
     \text{Change} = \text{Amount Prepared} - \text{Total Cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Change} = 20 - 10 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Violetta will receive $10 in change after buying the crayons.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- She has prepared $20 for the purchase.
- Each crayon costs $2.

To find the change Violetta will get, we need to calculate the total cost of the crayons and then subtract it from the amount she has prepared.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
Total cost = 5 × $2 = $10

Step 2: Calcul...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Violetta will spend on the crayons and then calculate how much change she will receive from her $20.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Crayons Needed:**
   Violetta wants crayons in 5 different colors. Therefore, she needs to buy 5 crayons.

2. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Crayons:**
   Each crayon costs $2. To find the total cost for 5 crayons, we multiply the number of crayons by the cost...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Violetta needs 5 different colors
* Each crayon costs $2
* She has $20 to spend

2. Calculate the total cost for the crayons:
* Number of crayons needed = 5 crayons
* Cost per crayon = $2
* Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per crayon
* Total cost = 5 × $2 = $10

3. Calculate the change:
* Change = Money prepared - Total cost
* Change = $20 - $10 = $10

There...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Violetta wants to buy crayons in 5 different colors. If one crayon costs $2, then the total cost for 5 crayons would be 5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10.

She prepared $20 for this purchase. So, the change she will get is the money she prepared minus the cost of the crayons. 

That is, $20 - $10 = $10.

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
- She has prepared $20 for this purchase.
- One crayon costs $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of crayons Violetta needs.
Since she needs crayons in 5 different colors, and we assume she needs one of each color, the total number of crayons is 5.

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
Total cost = Number of crayons × Cost per...
