Final Answer: To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after applying a 40% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original cost of the shirts**: 
   Each shirt costs $30. Since Davos bought 2 shirts, we can calculate the total original cost as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total original cost} = \text{Cost per shirt} \times \text{Number of shirts} = 30 \times 2 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount**: 
   The discount is 40% of the total original cost. To find the discount amount, we first convert the percentage into a decimal:
   \[
   40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40
   \]
   Now we can calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total original cost} \times \text{Discount rate} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the final price after the discount**: 
   To find out how much Davos actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the total original cost:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Total original cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Davos paid for the 2 shirts after the discount is **$36**.

Final answer: **$36**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Davos bought 2 shirts from the mall.
- Each shirt costs $30.
- There is a 40% discount on the shirts.

Step 1: Calculate the original total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount.
Original cost of 2 shirts = 2 × $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
Discount percentage = 40%
Discount amount = Original cost × Discount percentage
Discount amount = $60 × 0.40 = $24

Step 3: Calcula...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Davos paid for the two shirts after applying the 40% discount.

**Step 1: Determine the original total cost of the shirts.**

Davos bought 2 shirts, and each shirt costs $30. Therefore, the original total cost without any discount is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Original total cost} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt} = 2 \times 30 = 60
\]

So, the original total cost for the 2 shirts is $6...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the original total cost of the shirts:
* Cost of one shirt = $30
* Number of shirts = 2
* Original total = $30 × 2 = $60

2. Now calculate the discount amount:
* Discount percentage = 40%
* To convert to decimal: 40% = 40/100 = 0.40
* Discount amount = Original total × Discount percentage
* Discount amount = $60 × 0.40 = $24

3. Calculate the final price after discount:
* Final price = Original ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount. Since each shirt costs $30, we multiply this by 2:

$30 * 2 = $60

So, the total cost of the 2 shirts without the discount is $60.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. Since the discount is 40%, we multiply the total cost by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%):

$60 * 0.40 = $24

So, the amount of the discount is $24.

Finally, we subtract the amount of the discount fr...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step, showing all the calculations and explaining the reasoning behind each step.

Given:
- Davos bought 2 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $30.
- The shirts were bought with a 40% discount.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount.
Total cost without discount = Number of shirts × Price per shirt
Total cost without discount = 2 × $30 = $60

Step 2: Calculate the discount amount.
