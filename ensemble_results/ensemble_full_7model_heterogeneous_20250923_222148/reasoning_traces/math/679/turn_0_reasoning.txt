=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes, given that 6 potatoes yield 36 hash browns.

### Step 1: Determine the hash browns per potato
First, we need to find out how many hash browns can be made from one potato. We know that:

- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns.

To find the number of hash browns per potato, we divide the total number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:

\[
\text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hash browns for 96 potatoes
Now that we know each potato produces 6 hash browns, we can calculate how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes:

\[
\text{Total hash browns} = \text{Number of potatoes} \times \text{Hash browns per potato}
\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[
\text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the multiplication
Now we perform the multiplication:

\[
96 \times 6 = 576
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is:

\[
\boxed{576}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns
- We need to find how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes

Step 1: Find the ratio of potatoes to hash browns.
Ratio of potatoes to hash browns = 6 potatoes : 36 hash browns
Simplifying the ratio, we get 1 potato : 6 hash browns

Step 2: Use the ratio to find the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* 6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns
* We want to find how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes

Step 1: Find how many hash browns are made per potato
* If 6 potatoes → 36 hash browns
* Hash browns per potato = 36 ÷ 6 = 6 hash browns per potato

Step 2: Calculate hash browns from 96 potatoes
* If each potato makes 6 hash browns
* Then 96 potatoes × 6 hash browns/potato = 576 hash browns

Verification:
*...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine the ratio of potatoes to hash browns. According to the problem, 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. 

So, the ratio is 6 potatoes : 36 hash browns. 

We can simplify this ratio by dividing both sides by 6, which gives us 1 potato : 6 hash browns. 

This means that for every 1 potato, we can make 6 hash browns. 

Now, we need to find out how many hash browns we can make with 96 potatoes. 

Since 1 potato makes 6 hash browns, we can multiply the numb...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to set up a proportion and solve for the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.

Given:
- 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns
- We want to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes

Step 1: Set up a proportion to relate the number of potatoes to the number of hash browns.
Let x be the number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes.
