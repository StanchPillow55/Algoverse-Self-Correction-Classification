=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the jogger jeans**:
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the original prices of the jeans**:
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the tattered jeans, which is $28.
   - Let \( y \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans are $6 less than the tattered jeans, we have:
     \[
     y = x - 6 = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the total savings**:
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on both jeans.

4. **Determine how much he saved from each pair of jeans**:
   - According to the problem, he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
   - The amount saved from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The amount saved from the tattered jeans is:
     \[
     \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the original prices based on the savings**:
   - If Cole saved $2 on the jogger jeans, we can find the original price of the jogger jeans:
     \[
     \text{Original price of jogger jeans} = \text{Sale price} + \text{Savings} = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - If Cole saved $4 on the tattered jeans, we can find the original price of the tattered jeans:
     \[
     \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = \text{Sale price} + \text{Savings} = 28 + 4 = 32 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the difference in original prices**:
   - Now we need to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans} = 24 - 32 = -8
     \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

**Final Answer**:
The jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The tattered jeans cost $28.
- The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Find the cost of the jogger jeans.
Cost of the jogger jeans = Cost of the tattered jeans - $6
Cost of the jogger jeans = $28 - $6 = $22

Step 2: Find the original c...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the original cost of the jogger jeans and compare it with the cost of the tattered jeans. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - We know the tattered jeans cost $28.
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22
     \]
   So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

2. **Understand the savings dis...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Tattered jeans on sale = $28
* Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered jeans on sale
* Total savings = $6
* 1/3 of savings from jogger jeans
* 2/3 of savings from tattered jeans

2. Calculate the sale price of jogger jeans:
* Jogger jeans = Tattered jeans - $6
* Jogger jeans = $28 - $6 = $22

3. Calculate savings for each type:
* Total savings = $6
* Jogger jeans savings = 1/3 Ã— $6 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, so they cost $28 - $6 = $22.

Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, so he saved $6 * 1/3 = $2 from the jogger jeans.

This means the jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

He saved the rest of the total savings from the tattered jeans, so he saved $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans.

This means the tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $32 - ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by identifying the important information given in the problem.

Given:
- Tattered jeans cost $28.
- Jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
- Cole saved a total of $6.
- He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Step 1: Calculate the original cost of the jogger jeans.
Jogger jeans cost = Tattered jeans cost - $6
Jogger jeans cost = $...
