=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of tennis shoes sold each day and accounting for the returns.

1. **Sales on Friday**: 
   The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes on Friday.
   \[
   \text{Friday sales} = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

2. **Sales on Saturday**: 
   On Saturday, the store sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Saturday sales} = 2 \times \text{Friday sales} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Sales on Sunday**: 
   On Sunday, the store sold half the amount they did on Saturday. Thus, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Sunday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Saturday sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \text{ pairs}
   \]

4. **Returns**: 
   On Sunday, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. We need to subtract these returns from the total sales on Sunday:
   \[
   \text{Net Sunday sales} = \text{Sunday sales} - \text{returns} = 14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs}
   \]

5. **Total Sales Calculation**: 
   Now, we will calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold over the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Friday sales} + \text{Saturday sales} + \text{Net Sunday sales}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 14 + 28 + 8 = 50 \text{ pairs}
   \]

Thus, the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Friday's sales:
* Friday = 14 pairs

2. Next, Saturday's sales were double Friday's:
* Saturday = 14 × 2 = 28 pairs

3. Sunday's sales were half of Saturday's:
* Sunday = 28 ÷ 2 = 14 pairs

4. But on Sunday, 6 people returned their shoes:
* Net Sunday sales = 14 - 6 = 8 pairs

5. To find total sales for the weekend, add all three days:
* Total = Friday + Saturday + Net Sunday
* Total = 14 + 28 +...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

On Saturday, the store sold double the amount they sold on Friday. So, 14 pairs * 2 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Saturday.

On Sunday, the store sold half the amount they sold on Saturday. So, 28 pairs / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes were sold on Sunday.

However, on Sunday, 6 people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. So, we subtract these from the total s...
