=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of the number of pink and white flamingos at each stage.

1. **Initial Setup (Friday Morning)**:
   - The neighbors placed **18 pink flamingos** in Sue's yard.
   - At this point, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: 18
     - White flamingos: 0

2. **Saturday Morning**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
     \[
     \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - Now, we update the counts:
     - Pink flamingos: \(18 - 6 = 12\)
     - White flamingos: 6 (the ones that were painted)

3. **Sunday Morning**:
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard.
   - We update the count of pink flamingos:
     \[
     \text{New count of pink flamingos} = 12 + 18 = 30
     \]
   - The count of white flamingos remains the same at 6.

4. **Final Counts at Noon on Sunday**:
   - Pink flamingos: 30
   - White flamingos: 6

5. **Calculating the Difference**:
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of pink flamingos} - \text{Number of white flamingos} = 30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are **24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos**.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out how many flamingos were taken back and painted white on Saturday. Since the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, we need to calculate one third of 18. 

To do this, we divide 18 by 3, which equals 6. 

So, on Saturday, there were 6 white flamingos and 12 pink flamingos (18 total flamingos - 6 white flamingos = 12 pink flamingos).

On Sunday, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection. So, the total number of pink...
