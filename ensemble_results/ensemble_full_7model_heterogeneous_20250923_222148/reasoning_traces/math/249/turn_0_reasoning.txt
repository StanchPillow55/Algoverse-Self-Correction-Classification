=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of cookies Sue's sister ate:**
   - On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
   - On Tuesday, she ate 13 cookies.

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total cookies eaten by sister} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 13 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 18 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on each day:**
   - On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister:
     \[
     \text{Cookies eaten by Sue on Monday} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
     \]
   - On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister:
     \[
     \text{Cookies eaten by Sue on Tuesday} = 2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total cookies eaten by Sue} = 20 \text{ (Monday)} + 26 \text{ (Tuesday)} = 46 \text{ cookies}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total calories consumed by Sue and her sister:**
   - Each cookie has 200 calories.
   - Total calories consumed by Sue:
     \[
     \text{Calories consumed by Sue} = 46 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 9200 \text{ calories}
     \]
   - Total calories consumed by her sister:
     \[
     \text{Calories consumed by sister} = 18 \text{ cookies} \times 200 \text{ calories/cookie} = 3600 \text{ calories}
     \]

6. **Calculate the difference in calories consumed between Sue and her sister:**
   \[
   \text{Difference in calories} = \text{Calories consumed by Sue} - \text{Calories consumed by sister} = 9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories}
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   Sue consumed **5600 more calories** than her sister.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5600}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Sue and her sister ate on Monday and Tuesday, calculate the total calories consumed by each, and then find the difference in calories consumed by Sue compared to her sister.

**Step 1: Determine the number of cookies eaten by Sue and her sister on each day.**

- **Monday:**
  - Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
  - Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many cookies Sue's sister ate in total:
* Monday: 5 cookies
* Tuesday: 13 cookies
* Total for sister = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies

2. Now let's find how many cookies Sue ate:
* Monday: 4 × 5 = 20 cookies (4 times her sister's amount)
* Tuesday: 2 × 13 = 26 cookies (2 times her sister's amount)
* Total for Sue = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies

3. Calculate the difference in cookies:
* Sue's total - Sister's t...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 5 cookies, this means Sue ate 4 * 5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies on Monday.

On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Since her sister ate 13 cookies, this means Sue ate 2 * 13 = <<2*13=26>>26 cookies on Tuesday.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = <<20+26=46>>46 cookies.

Her sister ate 5 + 13 = <<5+13=18>>18 cookies.

So, Sue ate 46 - 18 = <<46-18=28>>28 more cookies than her sister.
