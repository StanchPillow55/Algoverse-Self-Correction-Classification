Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies Cody eats based on the information given about Amir's cookie consumption, and then find the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir.

1. **Identify how many cookies Amir eats:**
   - The problem states that Amir eats 5 cookies.

2. **Determine how many cookies Cody eats:**
   - According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate the number of cookies Cody eats using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's cookies}
     \]
   - Substituting the number of cookies Amir eats:
     \[
     \text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cookies eaten by both:**
   - Now that we know how many cookies each person eats, we can find the total by adding the number of cookies eaten by Amir and Cody:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = 5 + 15 = 20
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of cookies eaten by both Cody and Amir together is:
     \[
     \boxed{20}
     \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we multiply the number of cookies Amir eats by 3. 

Amir's cookies: 5
Cody's cookies: 5 * 3 = 15

Next, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats to find out how many cookies they eat together.

Total cookies: Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies
Total cookies: 5 + 15 = 20

So, together, Cody and Amir eat 20 cookies.
