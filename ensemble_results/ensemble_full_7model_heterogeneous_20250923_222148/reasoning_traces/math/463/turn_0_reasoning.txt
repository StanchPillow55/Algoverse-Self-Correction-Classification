=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip she wants to give and then add that tip to the cost of the pizza delivery.

1. **Identify the cost of the pizza delivery**: 
   The cost of the pizza delivery is given as $15.

2. **Calculate the tip**: 
   Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the amount she ordered. Since the amount she ordered is $15, we need to calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $15.

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

   So, the tip is $3.

3. **Calculate the total amount to give to the delivery man**: 
   Now, we need to add the tip to the cost of the pizza delivery.

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Delivery} + \text{Tip}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is **$18**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cost of the pizza delivery is $15.
- Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the tip amount.
Tip amount = 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost
Tip amount = 1/5 × $15 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.
Total amount = Pizza delivery cost + Tip amount
Total amount = $15 + $3 = $18

Therefore, the total ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount Ashley should give to the delivery man, which includes both the cost of the pizza delivery and the tip she wants to give. The tip is specified to be 1/5 of the cost of the pizza delivery.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of the pizza delivery:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* The pizza delivery costs $15
* Ashley wants to give a tip equal to 1/5 of the order amount

2. To find the tip amount:
* Tip = 1/5 × $15
* Tip = $15 ÷ 5
* Tip = $3

3. To find the total amount to give the delivery man:
* Total = Original cost + Tip
* Total = $15 + $3
* Total = $18

Reasoning: Since Ashley wants to tip 1/5 (or 20%) of the order amount, I divided $15 by 5 to ge...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of the tip Ashley wants to give. According to the problem, the tip is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered, which is $15.

To calculate the tip, we multiply the amount of the order by 1/5:

$15 * 1/5 = $3

So, Ashley wants to give a $3 tip to the delivery man.

To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we add the amount of the order and the tip:

$15 (amount of the order) + $3 (tip) = $18

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to:
1. Calculate the tip amount
2. Add the tip amount to the cost of the pizza

Step 1: Calculate the tip amount
* The tip is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered.
* The amount she ordered is $15.
* To find 1/5 of $15, we divide $15 by 5.

Calculation:
$15 ÷ 5 = $3

Therefore, the tip amount is $3.

Step 2: Add the tip amount to the cost...
