Final Answer: To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests invited**:
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.

   Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family) = 45 guests.

2. **Determine how many guests will actually attend**:
   - Out of the 45 invited guests, 4 people said they could not come.

   Total guests attending = 45 (invited) - 4 (not coming) = 41 guests.

3. **Calculate the rental fee for the theater**:
   - The base fee to rent the theater is $125 for the first 20 guests.
   - For each additional guest beyond 20, there is an additional charge of $6.

   Since Kayla has 41 guests, we need to find out how many are additional guests beyond the first 20:
   - Additional guests = 41 (total attending) - 20 (included in base fee) = 21 additional guests.

4. **Calculate the additional cost for the extra guests**:
   - The cost for the additional guests is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Additional cost} = \text{Number of additional guests} \times \text{Cost per additional guest} = 21 \times 6 = 126.
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the party**:
   - The total cost is the sum of the base rental fee and the additional cost for the extra guests:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Base fee} + \text{Additional cost} = 125 + 126 = 251.
   \]

Thus, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party is **$251**. 

Final answer: **$251**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of invited guests:
* Classmates: 25
* Dance class friends: 7
* Family members: 13
* Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people

2. 4 people can't come, so:
* Actual attendees = 45 - 4 = 41 people

3. The base fee covers 20 people for $125
* Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 extra people

4. Calculate cost for additional guests:
* Cost per additional guest = $6
* Additional cost = 21...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many people Kayla invited in total. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. 

25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract those from the total number of people invited.

45 people - 4 people = 41 people

The movie theater fee covers a party of 20, so we need to find out how many additional guests Kayla has.

41 people -...
