Final Answer: To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours, and then apply the appropriate rates for each.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours**:
   - Eliza's regular hours are the first 40 hours she works each week.
   - Any hours worked beyond 40 hours are considered overtime.
   - In this case, Eliza worked a total of 45 hours this week.

   Therefore:
   - Regular hours = 40 hours
   - Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

2. **Calculate Regular Earnings**:
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - To find her earnings for the regular hours, we multiply her regular hours by her hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Earnings**:
   - Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - First, we calculate her overtime rate:
   \[
   \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Regular Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 12 \, \text{dollars/hour}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours:
   \[
   \text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings**:
   - To find Eliza's total earnings for the week, we add her regular earnings and her overtime earnings:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings} = 400 \, \text{dollars} + 60 \, \text{dollars} = 460 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are **$460**. 

Final answer: **$460**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours at her regular hourly rate and her earnings for the additional 5 hours at the overtime rate, then add them together to find her total earnings for the week.

Given information:
- Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
- Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
- Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her pay for both her regular hours and her overtime hours.

### Step 1: Calculate Regular Earnings
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 per hour. She works 40 regular hours each week. Therefore, her earnings for the regular hours are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hourly Rate} \times \text{Regular Hours Worked}
\]

\[
\text{Regular Earnings} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \tim...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Regular hourly rate = $10
* Regular hours = 40 hours
* Overtime rate = 1.2 × $10 = $12 per hour
* Overtime hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours

2. Calculate regular pay:
* Regular pay = Regular hours × Regular rate
* Regular pay = 40 hours × $10
* Regular pay = $400

3. Calculate overtime pay:
* Overtime pay = Overtime hours × Overtime rate
* Overtime pay = 5 hours × $12
* Overt...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Eliza's earnings can be calculated in two parts: her regular pay for the first 40 hours, and her overtime pay for the additional hours.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours, so her regular pay is:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so she earns 1.2 * $10 = $12 per hou...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
   * Her overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   * Eliza worked for 45 hours this week.

2. Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours:
   * Regular pay = Hourly rate × Number of regular hours
   * Regular pay = $10 × 40
   * Regular pay = $400

3. Calculate the number of o...
