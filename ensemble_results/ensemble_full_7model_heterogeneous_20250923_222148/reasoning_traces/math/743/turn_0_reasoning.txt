=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Slices on the Plate**: 
   Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on her plate.

   \[
   \text{Initial slices} = 2
   \]

2. **Adding Slices**: 
   Mara adds 3 slices to the plate.

   \[
   \text{Slices after adding} = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Tripling the Slices**: 
   Mara then triples the number of slices she currently has.

   \[
   \text{Tripled slices} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

4. **Eating Slices**: 
   Mara eats 2 slices from her plate.

   \[
   \text{Slices after eating} = 15 - 2 = 13
   \]

5. **Friend Stealing Slices**: 
   While Mara is distracted, her friend steals 5 slices from her plate.

   \[
   \text{Slices after friend steals} = 13 - 5 = 8
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- Started with 2 slices.
- Added 3 slices: \(2 + 3 = 5\).
- Tripled the slices: \(5 \times 3 = 15\).
- Ate 2 slices: \(15 - 2 = 13\).
- Friend stole 5 slices: \(13 - 5 = 8\).

Thus, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Mara started with 2 slices of cake on the plate.
- Mara added 3 more slices to the plate.
- Mara then tripled the number of slices she currently had.
- Mara ate 2 slices.
- Mara's friend stole 5 slices.

Step 1: Calculate the number of slices on the plate after Mara added 3 more slices.
Initial number of slices + Slices added = Total number of slices
2 + 3 = 5 slices
...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of actions described and perform the corresponding mathematical operations step by step.

1. **Initial Addition of Cake Slices:**
   - Mara starts with 2 slices of cake on the plate.
   - She adds 3 more slices to the plate.
   - Calculation: \(2 + 3 = 5\)
   - Now, there are 5 slices of cake on the plate.

2. **Tripling the Number of Slices:**
   - Mara triples the number of slices currently on the plate.
   - Calcul...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial slices on plate = 2 slices
   * Mara adds 3 slices
   * 2 + 3 = 5 slices now on plate

2. Mara triples the number of slices
   * Current slices = 5
   * Tripling means multiplying by 3
   * 5 Ã— 3 = 15 slices now on plate

3. Mara eats 2 slices
   * Current slices = 15
   * After eating 2: 15 - 2 = 13 slices remain

4. Friend steals 5 slices
   * Current slices = 13
   * After stealing 5: 13 - 5 = 8 slices...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on her plate. She added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices on her plate became 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Feeling hungrier, she tripled the number of slices she had. This means she multiplied the number of slices by 3. So, 5 slices * 3 = 15 slices.

After eating 2 slices, the number of slices left on her plate was 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Her friend then stole 5 slices from her plate, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

Therefore, Mara h...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mara started with a plate that had 2 slices of cake.
   * She added 3 more slices to the plate.
   * She then tripled the number of slices on the plate.
   * Mara ate 2 slices.
   * Her friend stole 5 slices from the plate.

2. Calculate the number of slices after Mara added 3 more:
   * Initial slices = 2
   * Added slices = 3
   * Total slices = Initial slices + A...
