=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Reports Received**: We know that the IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.

2. **Reports Received on Monday and Tuesday**: The problem states that on Monday and Tuesday, they received a total of 1907 reports.

3. **Reports Received on Thursday and Friday**: The problem also states that on Thursday and Friday, they received a total of 2136 reports.

4. **Calculating Reports Received on Wednesday**: To find the number of reports received on Wednesday, we can use the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Reports on Wednesday} = \text{Total Reports} - (\text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday})
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers we have:

   \[
   \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - (1907 + 2136)
   \]

5. **Calculating the Sum of Reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**:

   First, we need to calculate the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:

   \[
   1907 + 2136 = 4043
   \]

6. **Subtracting from Total Reports**:

   Now we can substitute this sum back into our equation:

   \[
   \text{Reports on Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   5168 - 4043 = 1125
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of reports received on Wednesday is:

   \[
   \boxed{1125}
   \]
