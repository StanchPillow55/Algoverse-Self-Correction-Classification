=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Jerry's current age based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the statement**: The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( x \).

2. **Setting up the equation**: Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \( x - 5 \). According to the problem, Jerry's current age \( x \) is twice his age from 5 years ago. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x = 2(x - 5)
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   - First, we will expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     x = 2x - 10
     \]
   - Next, we will isolate \( x \) by moving \( 2x \) to the left side:
     \[
     x - 2x = -10
     \]
     \[
     -x = -10
     \]
   - Now, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

4. **Finding Jerry's age in 3 years**: Now that we know Jerry's current age is 10, we can find out how old he will be in 3 years:
   \[
   \text{Age in 3 years} = 10 + 3 = 13
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, Jerry will be \( \boxed{13} \) years old in 3 years.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Jerry's current age and then calculate his age in 3 years.

Given information:
- Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.

Step 1: Find Jerry's current age.
Let Jerry's age 5 years ago be x.
Jerry's age 5 years ago = x
Jerry's current age = 2x (since he is twice as old as he was 5 years ago)

Step 2: Find Jerry's age in 3 years.
Jerry's age in 3 years = Jerry's current age + 3
Jerry's age in 3 years = 2x + 3

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Jerry's current age and then calculate how old he will be in 3 years.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are told that Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago.
   - We need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be Jerry's current age.
   - Five years ago, Jerry's age was \( x - 5 \).
   - According to the ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's say Jerry's current age is x

2) Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can write:
   * x = 2(x - 5)
   * This means his current age equals twice his age from 5 years ago

3) Let's solve this equation:
   * x = 2(x - 5)
   * x = 2x - 10
   * x - 2x = -10
   * -x = -10
   * x = 10

4) So Jerry is currently 10 years old

5) To verify this makes sense:
   * 5 years ago Jerry was: 10 - 5 = 5 year...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote Jerry's current age as "x". 

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be translated into the following equation:

x = 2 * (x - 5)

Solving this equation will give us Jerry's current age. 

First, distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Next, subtract 2x from both sides to isolate x:

x - 2x = -10

This simplifies to:

-x = -10

Finally, multiply both sides by -1 to solve for x:

x = 10

So, Jer...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jerry is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago.
   * We need to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years.

2. Let's define a variable for Jerry's current age:
   * Let x = Jerry's current age

3. Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:
   * Jerry's age 5 years ago: x - 5
   * Jerry is twice as old now as he was 5 years ago: x = 2(x - 5)

4. Solve...
