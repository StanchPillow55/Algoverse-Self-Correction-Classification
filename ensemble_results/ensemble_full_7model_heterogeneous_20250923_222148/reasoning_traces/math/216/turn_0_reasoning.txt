Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Janeth will owe in total after borrowing $2000 and adding 10% to that amount. Then, we will calculate how much she will have paid after 12 months and find out her remaining balance.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth owes after adding 10%.

1. **Initial Amount Borrowed**: $2000
2. **Interest Rate**: 10%

To find the total amount owed, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[
\text{Interest} = 10\% \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
\]

Now, we add this interest to the initial amount borrowed:

\[
\text{Total Amount Owed} = \text{Initial Amount} + \text{Interest} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.

Janeth plans to pay $165 each month for 12 months. We calculate the total payments:

\[
\text{Total Payments} = \text{Monthly Payment} \times \text{Number of Months} = 165 \times 12
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
165 \times 12 = 1980
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining balance after 12 months.

Now we subtract the total payments from the total amount owed to find the remaining balance:

\[
\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Amount Owed} - \text{Total Payments} = 2200 - 1980
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
2200 - 1980 = 220
\]

### Final Answer

Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be **$220**.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth owes after adding 10%.

1. **Initial Amount Borrowed**: $2000
2. **Interest Rate**: 10%

To find the total amount owed, we calculate 10% of $2000:

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Janeth borrowed $2000.
- Janeth promised to return the $2000 with an additional 10% of the amount.
- Janeth will pay $165 a month for 12 months.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back.
Total amount to be paid back = $2000 + (10% of $2000)
Total amount to be paid back = $2000 + ($2000 × 0.10)
Total amount to be paid back = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Step 2: Calculate th...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay, determine how much she will have paid after 12 months, and then find out her remaining balance.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. First, we calculate 10% of $2000:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 2000 = \frac{10}{100} \times 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
\]

The additional amount she needs to pa...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much Janeth needs to pay in total
   * Original loan = $2000
   * Additional 10% = $2000 × 0.10 = $200
   * Total amount to pay = $2000 + $200 = $2200

2. Calculate how much Janeth will pay over 12 months
   * Monthly payment = $165
   * Number of months = 12
   * Total paid = $165 × 12 = $1,980

3. Calculate the remaining balance
   * Remaining balance = Total amount to pay - Total pai...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate how much Janeth will owe in total. She borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

10% of $2000 is $2000 * 10/100 = $200. 

So, Janeth will owe a total of $2000 + $200 = $2200.

Next, we need to calculate how much Janeth will have paid after 12 months. She is paying $165 a month for 12 months, so she will have paid $165 * 12 = $1980.

Finally, we subtract the amount Janeth has paid from the total amount s...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Janeth borrowed $2000.
- She promised to return the amount with an additional 10%.
- She will pay $165 a month for 12 months.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to pay back.
Additional amount = 10% of $2000
Additional amount = 0.10 × $2000 = $200

Total amount to pay back = Borrowed amount + Additional amount
Total amount to pay back = $2000 + $200 = $2200

Step 2: Calculate the total...
