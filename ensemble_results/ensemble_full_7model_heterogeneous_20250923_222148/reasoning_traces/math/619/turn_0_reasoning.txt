=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of street lights at all the intersections and then subtract the number of non-functioning street lights.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection.

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the total number of street lights at one intersection can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Street lights per intersection} = \text{Number of poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole}
\]
\[
\text{Street lights per intersection} = 6 \text{ poles} \times 4 \text{ street lights/pole} = 24 \text{ street lights}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights for all intersections.

The road has 4 intersections. Therefore, the total number of street lights for all intersections is:

\[
\text{Total street lights} = \text{Street lights per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections}
\]
\[
\text{Total street lights} = 24 \text{ street lights/intersection} \times 4 \text{ intersections} = 96 \text{ street lights}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights.

According to the problem, 20 street lights are not working. To find the total number of functioning street lights, we subtract the non-functioning street lights from the total number of street lights:

\[
\text{Functioning street lights} = \text{Total street lights} - \text{Non-functioning street lights}
\]
\[
\text{Functioning street lights} = 96 \text{ street lights} - 20 \text{ street lights} = 76 \text{ street lights}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of functioning street lights is:

\[
\boxed{76}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights.
- The number of poles at each intersection is 6.
- The road has 4 intersections.
- 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights.
Number of street lights per pole = 4
Number of poles per intersection = 6
Number of intersections = 4

Total number of street lights = 4 × 6 × 4 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of street lights first, and then account for the non-functioning ones to find the number of functioning street lights.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights per intersection

Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each intersection. Therefore, the number of street lights per intersection is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Street lights per intersection} = \text{Number of pol...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the number of lights per intersection
* Each pole has 4 street lights
* Each intersection has 6 poles
* Lights per intersection = 4 lights × 6 poles
* Lights per intersection = 24 lights

2. Now, let's find the total number of lights for all intersections
* Number of intersections = 4
* Total lights = Lights per intersection × Number of intersections
* Total lights = 24 lights × 4 intersections

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights, and each intersection has 6 poles. Therefore, the total number of street lights at each intersection is 4 street lights/pole * 6 poles/intersection = 24 street lights/intersection.

Since the road has 4 intersections, the total number of street lights on the road is 24 street lights/intersection * 4 intersections = 96 street lights.

However, we know that 20 street lights are n...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps and calculate the total number of street lights, then subtract the non-functioning lights to get the final answer.

Given:
- Each pole has 4 street lights.
- Each intersection has 6 poles.
- The road has 4 intersections.
- 20 street lights are not working.

Step 1: Calculate the number of street lights on each pole.
Street lights per pole = 4

Step 2: Calculate the number of poles at each intersecti...
