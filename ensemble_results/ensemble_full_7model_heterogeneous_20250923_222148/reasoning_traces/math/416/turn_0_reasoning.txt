Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given about the herd of camels and dromedaries.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads can be expressed as:
   \[
   c + d = 180 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps can be expressed as:
   \[
   2c + d = 304 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \( c + d = 180 \)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( d \) into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now, simplify the equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]

Next, isolate \( c \):
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries using Equation 1:
\[
d = 180 - c
\]
\[
d = 180 - 124
\]
\[
d = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( 56 \).

To summarize:
- Number of camels \( c = 124 \)
- Number of dromedaries \( d = 56 \)

Finally, the answer to the question is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of dromedaries.

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads (animals) in the herd.
- There are 304 bumps (humps) in the herd.
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of camels in the herd.
- Let y be the numbe...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd given the total number of heads and humps. We know:

- Each animal (camel or dromedary) has one head.
- Camels have two humps each.
- Dromedaries have one hump each.

We are given:
- Total heads = 180
- Total humps = 304

Let's define:
- \( C \) as the number of camels.
- \( D \) as the number of dromedaries.

From the information given, we can set up the following system of equa...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Total number of heads = 180 (total animals)
* Total number of bumps = 304
* Camels have 2 bumps each
* Dromedaries have 1 bump each

Let's solve:
1. Let's define variables
   * Let d = number of dromedaries
   * Let c = number of camels
   
2. We can write two equations:
   * Total heads: d + c = 180 (equation 1)
   * Total bumps: d + 2c = 304 (equation 2)
   
3. From equation 1:
   * c = 180 - d

4. Substi...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. 

From the problem, we know two things:

1) The total number of heads is 180, which means C + D = 180.

2) The total number of humps is 304. Since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one, we can write this as 2C + D = 304.

We now have a system of two equations:

C + D = 180
2C + D = 304

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate D:

2C + D - (C ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the number of dromedaries in the herd.

Given:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 humps in total.
- Camels have two humps each.
- Dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define some variables:
Let 'c' be the number of camels and 'd' be the number of dromedaries.

Step 1: Express the total number of heads in terms of 'c' and 'd'.
