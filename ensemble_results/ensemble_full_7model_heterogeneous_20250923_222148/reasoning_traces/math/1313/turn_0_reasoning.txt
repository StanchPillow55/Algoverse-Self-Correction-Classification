=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much each watermelon was sold for, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost price per watermelon**:
   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons.

   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of watermelons}} = \frac{80}{50}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Cost price per watermelon} = 1.6
   \]

   So, the cost price per watermelon is $1.60.

2. **Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a profit of 25%**:
   The vendor sells the watermelons at a profit of 25%. To find the selling price, we need to calculate 25% of the cost price and then add it to the cost price.

   First, we calculate 25% of the cost price:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 25\% \text{ of } \text{Cost price} = 0.25 \times 1.6
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 0.4
   \]

   Now, we add this profit to the cost price to find the selling price:

   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = \text{Cost price} + \text{Profit} = 1.6 + 0.4
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Selling price per watermelon} = 2.0
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.

\[
\text{Final answer: } \boxed{2.00}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80.
- The vendor sold all the watermelons at a profit of 25%.

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons.
Total cost price = $80
Profit percentage = 25%
Profit amount = Total cost price × Profit percentage
Profit amount = $80 × 0.25 = $20
Total sellin...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the selling price of each watermelon after accounting for a 25% profit on the total cost.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Cost Price per Watermelon:**

   The vendor bought 50 watermelons for a total of $80. To find the cost price per watermelon, we divide the total cost by the number of watermelons:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Bought 50 watermelons
* Total cost = $80
* Profit = 25%

2. Let's find the cost per watermelon:
* Cost per watermelon = Total cost ÷ Number of watermelons
* Cost per watermelon = $80 ÷ 50
* Cost per watermelon = $1.60

3. Calculate the selling price with 25% profit:
* 25% of $1.60 = $1.60 × 0.25 = $0.40 (profit per watermelon)
* Selling price = Cost + Profit
* Selling ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much the fruit vendor spent on each watermelon. To do this, we divide the total cost of the watermelons by the number of watermelons. 

So, $80 ÷ 50 watermelons = $1.60 per watermelon.

Next, we need to calculate the profit per watermelon. The vendor made a profit of 25% on each watermelon. To find this, we multiply the cost of each watermelon by 25%.

So, $1.60 x 25% = $0.40 profit per watermelon.

Finally, we add the cost of each watermel...
