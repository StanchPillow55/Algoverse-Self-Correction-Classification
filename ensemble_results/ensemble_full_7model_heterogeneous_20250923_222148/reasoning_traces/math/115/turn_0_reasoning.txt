=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought.**
2. **Determine the new selling price after the price increase.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber.**
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber

Sasha has two types of boards:

- **2 x 4 x 10 boards**: She has 10 boards, and each cost $10.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times 10 \text{ dollars/board} = 100 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **4 x 4 x 10 boards**: She has 5 boards, and each cost $16.
  \[
  \text{Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times 16 \text{ dollars/board} = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add the total costs of both types of boards:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 100 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the new selling price after the price increase

The prices for lumber have gone up by 50%. We need to calculate the new selling prices for each type of board.

- **New selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards**:
  \[
  \text{New price} = 10 \text{ dollars} + (50\% \text{ of } 10 \text{ dollars}) = 10 + 0.5 \times 10 = 10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars/board}
  \]

- **New selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards**:
  \[
  \text{New price} = 16 \text{ dollars} + (50\% \text{ of } 16 \text{ dollars}) = 16 + 0.5 \times 16 = 16 + 8 = 24 \text{ dollars/board}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the lumber

Now we calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards.

- **Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards**:
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times 15 \text{ dollars/board} = 150 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards**:
  \[
  \text{Total revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times 24 \text{ dollars/board} = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Now, we add the total revenues from both types of boards:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 150 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 270 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 270 \text{ dollars} - 180 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Sasha makes a profit of **$90** from selling her leftover lumber.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the lumber Sasha bought, the total revenue from selling the lumber, and then calculate the profit.

Given information:
- Sasha has 10 leftover 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each.
- Sasha has 5 leftover 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each.
- The prices for lumber have gone up by 50% since Sasha bought the lumber.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the profit Sasha makes from selling her leftover lumber. We'll do this by calculating the selling price of each type of board after the price increase, then subtracting the original cost to find the profit.

### Step 1: Determine the Original Cost

1. **2 x 4 x 10 Boards:**
   - Sasha has 10 boards.
   - Each board originally cost $10.
   - Total original cost for these boards: 
     \[
     10 \text{ boards} \times \$10/\text{...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate what Sasha originally paid for all the lumber:
   * 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards × $10 = $100
   * 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards × $16 = $80
   * Total original cost = $100 + $80 = $180

2. The price has increased by 50%
   * To calculate new price: Original price × (1 + 0.50)
   * Or: Original price × 1.50

3. Let's calculate the new selling price for each type:
   * 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 ×...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much Sasha spent on the lumber. 

She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each, so she spent 10 boards * $10/board = $<<10*10=100>>100 on the 2 x 4 x 10 boards.

She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each, so she spent 5 boards * $16/board = $<<5*16=80>>80 on the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

So, in total, Sasha spent $100 + $80 = $<<100+80=180>>180 on lumber.

Now, the prices for lumber have gone up by 50%. This means that the price of the lumber...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step and solve it:

Given:
- Prices for lumber have gone up 50% since Sasha bought the lumber.
- Sasha has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each.
- Sasha has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards.
Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = Number of boards × Cost per board
Total cost of 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 × $10 = $100

Step 2: Calculate th...
