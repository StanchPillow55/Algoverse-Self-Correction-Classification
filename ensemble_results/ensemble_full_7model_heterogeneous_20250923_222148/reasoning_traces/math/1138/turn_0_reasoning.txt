=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of animals on Melanie's father's farm after three weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of animals**:
   - Initial number of cows: 50
   - Initial number of chickens: 20

   Total initial animals = Initial cows + Initial chickens
   \[
   \text{Total initial animals} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of cows and chickens added over three weeks**:
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
   - The duration is three weeks, which is equivalent to \(3 \times 7 = 21\) days.

   **Calculate the total number of cows added**:
   \[
   \text{Total cows added} = \text{Cows per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cows added} = 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
   \]

   **Calculate the total number of chickens added**:
   \[
   \text{Total chickens added} = \text{Chickens per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total chickens added} = 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of animals after three weeks**:
   - Total cows after three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total cows} = \text{Initial cows} + \text{Total cows added}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cows} = 50 + 420 = 470
   \]

   - Total chickens after three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total chickens} = \text{Initial chickens} + \text{Total chickens added}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total chickens} = 20 + 210 = 230
   \]

   - Total animals on the farm after three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = \text{Total cows} + \text{Total chickens}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total animals} = 470 + 230 = 700
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is \( \boxed{700} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, given the initial number of animals and the daily additions from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Number of Animals:**
   - Cows: 50
   - Chickens: 20

2. **Daily Additions:**
   - Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
   - Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

3. **Duration:**
   - The duration is thre...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the initial numbers:
* Starting cows = 50
* Starting chickens = 20
* Total starting animals = 50 + 20 = 70 animals

2. Calculate daily additions:
* New cows per day = 20
* New chickens per day = 10
* Total new animals per day = 20 + 10 = 30 animals

3. Calculate how many days in three weeks:
* 1 week = 7 days
* 3 weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days

4. Calculate total animals added over 21 days:
* Total...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine the number of days in three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks would be 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, let's calculate how many cows and chickens are brought to the farm each day.

For the cows, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day. Over 21 days, this would be 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

For the chickens, Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day. Over 21 days, this would be 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add these numbers to the initial n...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

Given:
- Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and 20 chickens.
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.
- This continues for three weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days in three weeks.
3 weeks = 3 × 7 days = 21 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cows added over three weeks.
Cows added = 20 cows per day × 21 days
Cows added = 420 cows
