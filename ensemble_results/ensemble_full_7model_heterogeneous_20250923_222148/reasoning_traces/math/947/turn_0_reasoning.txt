Final Answer: To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we will follow these steps:

1. **Start with the initial number of stickers**: Jasmine begins with 15 stickers for participating in class.

   \[
   \text{Initial stickers} = 15
   \]

2. **Subtract the stickers she lost**: Jasmine lost 7 stickers during playtime. We will subtract the lost stickers from her initial amount.

   \[
   \text{Stickers after losing some} = 15 - 7
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   15 - 7 = 8
   \]

   So, after losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers.

3. **Add the stickers she received for helping classmates**: Jasmine received an additional 5 stickers for helping her classmates. We will add these stickers to the amount she has after losing some.

   \[
   \text{Final stickers} = 8 + 5
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: After all the transactions, Jasmine has a total of 13 stickers.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Jasmine initially had 15 stickers. 

She then lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15. 

15 - 7 = 8 stickers

Then, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates. 

So, we add these 5 stickers to the 8 stickers she already had. 

8 + 5 = 13 stickers

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end. 

This is our final answer.
