=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the songs in 20 playlists, where each playlist contains 300 songs, and each song is 10 hours long.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists.

Each playlist contains 300 songs. Therefore, for 20 playlists, the total number of songs can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total number of songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total duration of all songs.

Each song lasts for 10 hours. To find the total duration of all 6000 songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song:

\[
\text{Total duration (in hours)} = \text{Total number of songs} \times \text{Duration of each song}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total duration (in hours)} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000
\]

### Final Answer

The total duration of the 20 playlists is:

\[
\boxed{60000} \text{ hours}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The number of songs in a playlist is 300.
- John has 20 such playlists.
- Each song is 10 hours long.

To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in the 20 playlists.
Total number of songs = Number of songs per playlist × Number of playlists
Total number of songs = 300 × 20 = 6,000 songs...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours that all the songs in John's 20 playlists will last.

1. **Determine the total number of songs in all playlists:**

   John has 20 playlists, and each playlist contains 300 songs. To find the total number of songs across all playlists, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs per playlist:

   \[
   \text{Total number of songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs}
   \]

2. **Calculat...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Each playlist has 300 songs
* John has 20 playlists
* Each song is 10 hours long

2. Let's find the total number of songs across all playlists:
* Number of songs per playlist × Number of playlists
* 300 × 20 = 6,000 total songs

3. Now we can calculate the total hours by multiplying total songs by hours per song:
* Total songs × Hours per song
* 6,000 × 10 = 60,000 hou...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist:

20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs

Next, we need to find out how long all these songs will last. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 6...

Given information:
- The number of songs in a playlist is 300.
- John has 20 such playlists.
- Each song is 10 hours long.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in all 20 playlists.
Total songs = Number of songs per playlist × Number of playlists
Total songs = 300 × 20 = 6,000 songs

Step 2: Calculate the total duration of all songs in hours.
Total duration = Total songs × Duration of each song
