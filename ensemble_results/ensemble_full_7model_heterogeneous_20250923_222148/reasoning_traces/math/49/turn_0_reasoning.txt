Final Answer: To find the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building.**
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total Units} = \text{Number of Floors} \times \text{Units per Floor} = 15 \times 8
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     15 \times 8 = 120
     \]
   - So, the total number of units in the building is **120**.

2. **Determine the number of occupied units.**
   - We know that \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the building is occupied.
   - To find the number of occupied units, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Occupied Units} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total Units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
     \]
   - Thus, the number of occupied units is **90**.

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units.**
   - To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:
     \[
     \text{Unoccupied Units} = \text{Total Units} - \text{Occupied Units} = 120 - 90
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     120 - 90 = 30
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is **30**.

Finally, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of units in the building and then subtract the number of occupied units to get the number of unoccupied units.

Given information:
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
Total number of units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 × 8 = 120 unit...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of units in the building, calculate how many of those units are occupied, and then find out how many are unoccupied.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.**

The building has 15 floors, and each floor contains 8 units. To find the total number of units, we multiply the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

\[
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of units in the building
* Number of floors = 15
* Units per floor = 8
* Total units = 15 × 8 = 120 units

2. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied
* This means 3/4 of 120 units are occupied
* And 1/4 of 120 units are unoccupied

3. To find unoccupied units:
* Unoccupied units = 1/4 × 120
* 120 ÷ 4 = 30 units

Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we multiply 15 by 8 to get the total number of units. 

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. So, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4 to find the number of occupied units.

120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Finally, to find the number of unoccupi...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The apartment building has 15 floors.
   * Each floor has 8 units.
   * 3/4 of the building is occupied.

2. Calculate the total number of units in the building:
   * Total units = Number of floors × Units per floor
   * Total units = 15 × 8
   * Total units = 120

3. Calculate the number of occupied units:
   * Occupied units = Total units × Occupied fraction
