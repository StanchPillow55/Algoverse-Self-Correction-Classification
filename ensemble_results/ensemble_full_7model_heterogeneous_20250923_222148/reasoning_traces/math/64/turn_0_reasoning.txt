=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to first calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the miles driven per gallon:**
   - Sophia has driven 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank.
   - To find the miles per gallon, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank:**
   - The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas.
   - To find out how far she can drive on a full tank, we multiply her car's fuel efficiency by the total capacity of the tank:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Miles per gallon} \times \text{Tank capacity}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total distance Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas is:
     \[
     \boxed{300 \text{ miles}}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car and then use that information to calculate the maximum distance she can drive on a single tank of gas.

Given information:
- Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank.
- She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up the tank again.
- The owner's manual says the tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

Step 1: Calculate the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Fuel Efficiency (mpg):**

   Sophia traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank. The fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) can be calculated using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Fuel Efficiency (mpg)}...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what we know:
* Sophia drove 100 miles
* She used 4 gallons of gas to drive those 100 miles
* Her car's gas tank holds 12 gallons total

2) Let's find out how many miles per gallon (MPG) her car gets:
* MPG = Miles driven ÷ Gallons used
* MPG = 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons
* MPG = 25 miles per gallon

3) Now that we know her car gets 25 miles per gallon, we can calculate how far she can drive on ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many miles Sophia's car can drive per gallon of gas. We can do this by dividing the total miles she has driven by the total gallons of gas she used. 

So, 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. 

This means that Sophia's car can drive 25 miles on one gallon of gas. 

Next, we need to find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a full tank of gas. Since her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas, we can do this by multiplying the miles per ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Sophia has driven 100 miles since last filling her tank.
   * She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill the tank up again.
   * Her car's gas tank holds 12 gallons of gas.

2. Calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) Sophia's car gets:
   * Miles driven ÷ Gallons used = MPG
   * 100 miles ÷ 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon
   
   Explanation: To find the MPG, we divide ...
