=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out what percentage of Carol's total work time she spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time spent on each activity**:
   - Time spent writing the song: 4 hours
   - Time spent recording the song: half of 4 hours, which is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) hours
   - Time spent editing the song: 90 minutes

2. **Convert all times to the same unit**:
   Since we have hours and minutes, we will convert everything to hours for consistency.
   - 90 minutes can be converted to hours by dividing by 60:
     \[
     90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} \text{ hours} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on all activities**:
   Now we can add the time spent on each activity:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time writing} + \text{Time recording} + \text{Time editing}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of time spent editing**:
   To find the percentage of the total time that was spent editing, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1.5 \text{ hours}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} \right) \times 100
   \]

5. **Perform the calculation**:
   First, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{7.5} = 0.2
   \]
   Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing is \( \boxed{20\%} \).

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.
- Carol spends half that much time recording the song.
- Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent recording the song.
Time spent recording = 1/2 × 4 hours = 2 hours

Step 2: Calculate the total time spent on the song.
Total time = Time spent writing + Time spent recording + Time spent editing
Total time = 4 hours + 2 ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine what percentage of Carol's total work time was spent editing, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**
   - Writing: Carol spends 4 hours writing the song.
   - Recording: She spends half the time she spent writing on recording. Therefore, the time spent recording is:
     \[
     \frac{4 \text{ hours}}{2} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Editing: Carol spends 90 minutes editing the song. Since we are working with hours...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify all the time periods and convert them to the same unit (minutes)
   * Writing time = 4 hours = 4 × 60 = 240 minutes
   * Recording time = half of writing time = 240 ÷ 2 = 120 minutes
   * Editing time = 90 minutes

2. Calculate total work time
   * Total time = Writing + Recording + Editing
   * Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = 450 minutes

3. Calculate percentage spent editing
   * Percentage ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much time Carol spent on each task in minutes, since the editing time is given in minutes.

Writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes

Recording: Half the time of writing = 240 / 2 = 120 minutes

Editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's calculate the total time Carol spent on all tasks.

Total time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 450 minutes

Now, we want to find out what percentage...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Carol spends 4 hours writing a song.
   * She spends half of the writing time recording the song.
   * She spends 90 minutes editing the song.
   * We need to find the percentage of her total work time spent on editing.

2. Calculate the time Carol spends recording the song:
   * Recording time = 1/2 × Writing time
   * Recording time = 1/2 × 4 hours
   * Recordi...
