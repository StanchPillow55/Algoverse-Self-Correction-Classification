=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**:
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School**:
   He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends**:
   He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home**:
   He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
   Now, we add these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

5. **Lollipops Eaten at Night**:
   He eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

6. **Lollipops Eaten in the Morning**:
   He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

Finally, after performing all these calculations, we find that Oscar has:
\[
\boxed{31} \text{ lollipops}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.
- He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
- He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
- He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.
- He eats 3 more lollipops that night and 2 more in the morning.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops Oscar has after eating 2 on his way to school.
Number of lollipops after eating 2 = 24 - 2...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of lollipops Oscar has at each step of the scenario. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Lollipops:**
   - Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School:**
   - Oscar eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   - Calculation: \(24 - 2 = 22\)
   - Oscar now has 22 lollipops.

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends:**
   - Oscar gives 14 lollipops to his friends....

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of lollipops:
* Oscar starts with 24 lollipops

2. Eats 2 on way to school:
* 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remaining

3. Gives 14 to friends:
* 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remaining

4. Buys twice as many as he gave to friends:
* He gave 14 to friends
* So he buys: 14 × 2 = 28 new lollipops
* Current total: 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops

5. Eats 3 that night:
* 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops remaining

6. Eats 2 more in morning...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. 

He eats 2 on his way to school, so 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops remain.

He gives 14 to his friends, so 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops remain.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. This means he buys 2 * 14 = 28 lollipops.

Adding these to his remaining lollipops, 8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so 36 - 3 = 33 lollipops remain.

He eats 2 more in the morning, so 33 - 2 = 31 lollipops remain.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. On his way to school, he eats 2 lollipops.
   * Remaining lollipops = 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops

3. He passes out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   * Remaining lollipops = 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops

4. On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends.
   * Lollipops given to friends = 14
   * Lollipops bought = 14 × 2 = 28
   * Total lollipops after buy...
