=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John and Jack have left to reach school after walking to the library and the fire station.

1. **Total Time Available**: John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.

2. **Time to the Library**: It takes them 6 minutes to walk to the library.

3. **Time from the Library to the Fire Station**: After reaching the library, it takes them another 13 minutes to walk to the fire station.

4. **Total Time Spent Walking to the Fire Station**: We need to add the time taken to walk to the library and the time taken to walk from the library to the fire station:
   \[
   \text{Total time to fire station} = \text{Time to library} + \text{Time from library to fire station}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time to fire station} = 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Time Remaining to Get to School**: Now, we subtract the total time spent walking to the fire station from the total time available to find out how much time they have left to get to school:
   \[
   \text{Time remaining} = \text{Total time available} - \text{Total time to fire station}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time remaining} = 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, John and Jack have **11 minutes** left to get to school without being late.

Final answer: **11 minutes**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes for John and Jack to walk to school and then subtract it from the total time they have to get to school.

Given information:
- John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school together.
- It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.
- It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes for John and Jack to walk to sch...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John and Jack have left to reach school without being late, given that they have a total of 30 minutes to get there.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Time Available**: John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.

2. **Time Spent Walking to the Library**: It takes them 6 minutes to walk from their starting point to the corner where the library is located.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Total time available = 30 minutes
* Time to library corner = 6 minutes
* Time from library to fire station = 13 minutes

2. Let's calculate how much time they've used so far:
* Time used = Time to library + Time to fire station
* Time used = 6 minutes + 13 minutes
* Time used = 19 minutes

3. Now we can calculate remaining time:
* Remaining time = Total time avai...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much time John and Jack have already spent walking. We do this by adding the time it takes them to get to the corner where the library is and the time it takes them to get to the fire station. 

So, 6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how much time they have left to get to school. We do this by subtracting the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.
   * It takes them 6 minutes to reach the corner where the library is.
   * From the library, it takes them another 13 minutes to reach the fire station.

2. Calculate the total time they have spent walking so far:
   * Time to reach the library = 6 minutes
   * Time from the library to the fire station ...
