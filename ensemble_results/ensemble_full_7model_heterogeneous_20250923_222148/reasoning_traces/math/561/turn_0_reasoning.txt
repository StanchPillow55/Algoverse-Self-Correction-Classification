=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we will first determine the weights of each individual based on the information given.

1. **Weight of Mark**: 
   - Mark weighs 150 pounds.

2. **Weight of Susan**:
   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark. 
   - Therefore, we calculate Susan's weight as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Susan} = \text{Weight of Mark} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Weight of Bob**:
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan. 
   - We calculate Bob's weight as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Bob} = 2 \times \text{Weight of Susan} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculating the total weight of the three friends**:
   - Now we add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of Mark} + \text{Weight of Susan} + \text{Weight of Bob}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Calculating the average weight**:
   - To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends (which is 3):
     \[
     \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is \( \boxed{180} \) pounds.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark weighs 150 pounds.
- Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
- Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

Step 1: Calculate Susan's weight.
Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
Susan's weight = 150 pounds - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

Step 2: Calculate Bob's weight.
Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
Bob's weight = 2 × 130 pounds = 260 pounds

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the three frie...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Susan's weight:**
   - We know that Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   - Mark's weight is given as 150 pounds.
   - Therefore, Susan's weight is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine Bob's weight:**
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   - We have already calcu...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify Mark's weight:
* Mark = 150 pounds

2. Next, let's calculate Susan's weight:
* Susan = Mark - 20
* Susan = 150 - 20
* Susan = 130 pounds

3. Now let's calculate Bob's weight:
* Bob = 2 × Susan
* Bob = 2 × 130
* Bob = 260 pounds

4. To find the average weight, I need to:
* Add all three weights
* Divide by the number of people (3)

5. Calculating the average:
* Average = (Mark + Susan + Bob) ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Susan and Bob weigh.

Given that Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight to find Susan's weight.

150 pounds (Mark's weight) - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so we multiply Susan's weight by 2 to find Bob's weight.

130 pounds (Susan's weight) x 2 = 260 pounds

So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the three friends, we ad...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Mark weighs 150 pounds.
   * Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   * Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.

2. Calculate Susan's weight:
   * Susan's weight = Mark's weight - 20 pounds
   * Susan's weight = 150 - 20 = 130 pounds

3. Calculate Bob's weight:
   * Bob's weight = 2 × Susan's weight
   * Bob's weight = 2 × 130 = 260 pounds

4. Calculate the total wei...
