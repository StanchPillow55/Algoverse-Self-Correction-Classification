=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps, calculating how much money Julie spends at each stage and how much she has left after each expenditure.

1. **Initial Amount**: Julie starts with $500.

2. **Calculating the Amount Spent on Clothes**:
   - Julie spends 20% of her initial amount on clothes.
   - To find 20% of $500, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100
     \]
   - So, Julie spends $100 on clothes.

3. **Calculating Remaining Money After Clothes**:
   - We subtract the amount spent on clothes from the initial amount:
     \[
     500 - 100 = 400
     \]
   - After buying clothes, Julie has $400 left.

4. **Calculating the Amount Spent on CDs**:
   - Next, Julie spends 25% of her remaining money on CDs.
   - To find 25% of $400, we calculate:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
     \]
   - So, Julie spends $100 on CDs.

5. **Calculating Remaining Money After CDs**:
   - We subtract the amount spent on CDs from the remaining amount after buying clothes:
     \[
     400 - 100 = 300
     \]
   - After buying CDs, Julie has $300 left.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left is:
     \[
     \boxed{300}
     \]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Calculate the amount spent on clothes

Julie spent 20% of her money on clothes. To find out how much money she spent, we multiply her total money by 20%.

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining money after buying clothes

To find out how much money Julie had left after buying clothes, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from her total money.

$500 - $100 = $400

So, Julie had $400 left after buying clothes.
