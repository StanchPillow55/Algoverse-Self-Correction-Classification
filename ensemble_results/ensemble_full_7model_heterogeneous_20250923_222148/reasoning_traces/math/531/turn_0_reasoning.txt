=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial number of passengers**: 
   There are 48 people riding the bus initially.

2. **First stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers after the first stop**:
     \[
     48 - 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: The problem states that 5 times as many people get on as those who got off. Since 8 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
     \[
     5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ passengers}
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the first stop**:
     \[
     40 + 40 = 80 \text{ passengers}
     \]

3. **Second stop**:
   - **Passengers getting off**: 21 passengers get off the bus.
   - **Calculating remaining passengers after the second stop**:
     \[
     80 - 21 = 59 \text{ passengers}
     \]
   - **Passengers getting on**: The problem states that 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off. Since 21 passengers got off, the number of passengers getting on is:
     \[
     \frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ passengers}
     \]
   - **Calculating total passengers after the second stop**:
     \[
     59 + 7 = 66 \text{ passengers}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   After the second stop, there are **66 passengers** riding the bus.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

Step 1: Calculate the number of passenge...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track the number of passengers on the bus through each stop, step by step.

**Initial Condition:**
- There are initially 48 people on the bus.

**First Stop:**
1. **Passengers getting off:** 8 passengers get off the bus.
   - New number of passengers = Initial passengers - Passengers getting off
   - New number of passengers = 48 - 8 = 40 passengers

2. **Passengers getting on:** 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on th...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Initial number of passengers: 48

FIRST STOP:
* 8 passengers get off
* After getting off: 48 - 8 = 40 passengers
* 5 times as many people as those who got off (8) get on
* Number getting on = 8 Ã— 5 = 40 passengers
* After first stop total: 40 + 40 = 80 passengers

SECOND STOP:
* 21 passengers get off
* After getting off: 80 - 21 = 59 passengers
* 3 times fewer passengers get on than those who got off
* Number gettin...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of passengers after the first stop.
Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus. After the first stop, 8 passengers get off the bus, so the number of passengers becomes 48 - 8 = 40.

Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. That means 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.

So, after the first stop, the total number of passengers on the bus is 40 (remaining after...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the initial number of passengers and then calculate the number of passengers after each stop.

Given:
- Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get on the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

Step 1: Calculate the number of passengers after the...
