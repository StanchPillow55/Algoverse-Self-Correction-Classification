=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how fast the fastest car goes, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the average car**: 
   The problem states that the average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph). 

   \[
   \text{Speed of average car} = 120 \text{ mph}
   \]

2. **Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car**: 
   The 2nd fastest car is said to be 5 times faster than the average car. Therefore, we can calculate its speed as follows:

   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of average car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times 120 \text{ mph} = 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Calculate the speed of the fastest car**: 
   The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. We can calculate its speed as follows:

   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of 2nd fastest car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 \text{ mph}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Speed of fastest car} = 750 \text{ mph}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The speed of the fastest car is:

   \[
   \boxed{750 \text{ mph}}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the fastest car based on the given information.

Given information:
- The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
- The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

Step 1: Find the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 × Speed of the average car
Speed of the 2nd fastest car = 5 × 120 miles per hour...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the fastest car based on the given relationships between the speeds of different cars.

1. **Determine the speed of the 2nd fastest car:**

   We are told that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour (mph).

   \[
   \text{Speed of the 2nd fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Speed of the average car}
   \]

   Substituting the speed of the average car:

   \[
...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Fastest car is 1.25 times faster than 2nd fastest car
- 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than average car
- Average car speed = 120 mph

Step 1: Find speed of 2nd fastest car
* 2nd fastest car = Average car speed × 5
* 2nd fastest car = 120 mph × 5
* 2nd fastest car = 600 mph

Step 2: Find speed of fastest car
* Fastest car = 2nd fastest car × 1.25
* Fastest car = 600 mph × 1.25
* Fastest car =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to find out the speed of the 2nd fastest car first, and then use that to find out the speed of the fastest car.

We know that the 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car. The average car can go 120 miles per hour. So, the speed of the 2nd fastest car would be:

5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.

Now, we know that the fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, the speed of the fastest car would be:

1.25 * 600...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way to the speed of the fastest car.

Given:
- The fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.
- The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
- The average car can go 120 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the 2nd fastest car.
The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car.
Speed of 2nd fastest car = 5 ...
