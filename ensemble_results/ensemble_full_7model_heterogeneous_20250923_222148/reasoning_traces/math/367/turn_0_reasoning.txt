Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks**:
   - We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

2. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting**:
   - According to the problem, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is equal to four times the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks minus 5.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     S = 4 \times 3 - 5
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     S = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]
   - So, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting.

3. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for physical violence**:
   - The problem states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence.
   - Let \( V \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     V = 3 \times S = 3 \times 7
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     V = 21
     \]
   - So, 21 customers were kicked out for physical violence.

4. **Calculate the total number of customers kicked out**:
   - Now we can find the total number of customers kicked out for all the reasons we have calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = \text{mask refusals} + \text{shoplifting} + \text{physical violence}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total kicked out} = 3 + 7 + 21 = 31
     \]

5. **Determine the number of customers kicked out for other reasons**:
   - We know from the problem that the total number of people kicked out of Walmart is 50.
   - To find the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the total we calculated from the overall total:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = \text{Total kicked out} - \text{Total known reasons}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Other reasons} = 50 - 31 = 19
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of customers kicked out for other reasons is \( \boxed{19} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of people kicked out for reasons other than refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, or physical violence over goods on sale. We will use algebra to find the solution.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks.
- Let \( y \) be the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.
- Let \( z \) be the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* 3 people were kicked out for not wearing masks
* Shoplifters = (4 × mask refusers) - 5
* Violence = 3 × shoplifters
* Total kicked out = 50 people

2. Calculate number of shoplifters:
* Shoplifters = (4 × 3) - 5
* Shoplifters = 12 - 5
* Shoplifters = 7 people

3. Calculate number kicked out for violence:
* Violence = 3 × shoplifters
* Violence = 3 × 7
* Violence = 21 people

4. Add ...
