=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**
2. **Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.**
3. **Calculate the total amount spent.**
4. **Determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases.**
5. **Add the extra money given by his mother.**
6. **Calculate the final amount of money Dean has.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the toy cars
Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the toy cars is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of toy cars} = \text{Number of toy cars} \times \text{Cost per toy car} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears
Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. Therefore, the total cost for the teddy bears is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of teddy bears} = \text{Number of teddy bears} \times \text{Cost per teddy bear} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent
Now, we will add the total costs of the toy cars and teddy bears to find out how much Dean spent in total:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of toy cars} + \text{Total cost of teddy bears} = 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases
Initially, Dean's mother gave him $28. After spending $17 on toys, we can find out how much money he has left:

\[
\text{Money left after purchases} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total amount spent} = 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Add the extra money given by his mother
Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. We will add this amount to the money he has left:

\[
\text{Total money after extra amount} = \text{Money left after purchases} + \text{Extra money} = 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
After all calculations, the total amount of money Dean has left is:

\[
\boxed{21} \text{ dollars}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Dean spends at the toy store and how much money he has left after receiving an additional $10 from his mother.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**

Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. To find the total cost of the toy cars, we multiply the number of toy cars by the cost per car:

\[
6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2/\text{car} = \$12
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tedd...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much Dean spent on toy cars:
* Cost of one toy car = $2
* Number of toy cars bought = 6
* Total cost of toy cars = $2 × 6 = $12

2. Next, let's calculate how much Dean spent on teddy bears:
* Cost of one teddy bear = $1
* Number of teddy bears bought = 5
* Total cost of teddy bears = $1 × 5 = $5

3. Calculate total amount spent:
* Total spent = Cost of toy cars + Cost of teddy bears
* T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money Dean spent on the toy cars and teddy bears. 

The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars * $2/car = $12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears * $1/bear = $5.

Adding these two amounts together, we find that Dean spent $12 + $5 = $17 at the toy store.

Dean started with $28, so after his purchases, he had $28 - $17 = $11 left.

Then, his mother gave him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $21.

So, Dean has $21 left.
