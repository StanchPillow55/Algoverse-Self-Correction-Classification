=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Marcy's annual pension after she quits the company after 30 years of service. 

1. **Understanding the Pension Structure**:
   - Marcy is entitled to an annual pension of $50,000 if she works for 40 years.
   - After 20 years of service, she becomes entitled to an additional 5% of the value of the pension for each year worked beyond 20 years.

2. **Calculating the Years Worked Beyond 20**:
   - Marcy works for a total of 30 years.
   - The number of years she worked beyond the initial 20 years is:
     \[
     30 \text{ years} - 20 \text{ years} = 10 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Additional Pension**:
   - For each of the 10 years beyond the 20-year mark, she earns an additional 5% of the $50,000 pension.
   - The additional amount she earns per year for each of those 10 years is:
     \[
     5\% \text{ of } 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
     \]
   - Therefore, over the 10 years, the total additional pension amount is:
     \[
     10 \text{ years} \times 2,500 = 25,000
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Annual Pension**:
   - Marcy's total annual pension after 30 years of service will be the original pension plus the additional amount earned:
     \[
     \text{Total Annual Pension} = 50,000 + 25,000 = 75,000
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Marcy's annual pension after quitting the company after 30 years is:
     \[
     \boxed{75,000}
     \]

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. This means that for each year after the 20th year, her pension increases by 5% of $50,000.

First, let's calculate how much the pension increases by each year:

5% of $50,000 = 0.05 * $50,000 = $2,500

This means that each year after the 20th year, her pension increases by $2,500.

Marcy quits after 30 years, which means she worked for 10 years after the 20th year. So, we need to calculate h...
