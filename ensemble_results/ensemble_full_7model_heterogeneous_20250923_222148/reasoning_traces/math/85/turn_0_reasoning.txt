=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing**:
   - Gene is currently 34 years old.
   - He started vacationing at the age of 23.
   - Therefore, the number of years he has been vacationing is:
     \[
     34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of vacations he takes each year**:
   - According to the problem, Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.

3. **Calculate the total number of vacations**:
   - To find the total number of vacations Gene has taken over the 11 years, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year:
     \[
     11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of quilt blocks**:
   - Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block (one shirt from each vacation), the total number of quilt blocks Gene has is equal to the total number of vacations:
     \[
     \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44
     \]

Thus, after following all the steps and calculations, we find that Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**.

**Final Answer**: 44 quilt blocks.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many years Gene has been vacationing and how many quilt blocks he has in total, given that each vacation results in one quilt block.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**

   Gene started vacationing at the age of 23 and is currently 34 years old. To find out how many years he has been vacationing, we subtract the age he started from his current age:

   \[
   \text{Cur...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's determine how many years of vacations Gene has taken:
* He started at age 23 and is now 34
* Number of years = 34 - 23 = 11 years

2. Next, let's calculate how many vacations he takes per year:
* Gene takes 4 vacations per year

3. Now we can calculate the total number of vacations (and therefore t-shirt blocks):
* Total blocks = Number of years × Vacations per year
* Total blocks = 11 × 4 = 44 block...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many years Gene has been going on vacations. We do this by subtracting the age he started vacationing (23 years old) from his current age (34 years old). 

34 - 23 = 11 years

So, Gene has been going on vacations for 11 years. 

Since he goes on four vacations a year, we can find out how many vacations (and therefore how many shirts/quilt blocks) he has by multiplying the number of years he's been vacationing by the number of vacations he ta...
