=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate John's total earnings for the week.**
   - John earns $50 per hour and works 6 hours.
   - Total earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine John's expenses.**
   - John spends $50 on gas and wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   - Total expenses = Gas expense + Bank deposit
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate John's remaining money after expenses.**
   - Remaining money = Total earnings - Total expenses
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 150 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the pencils.**
   - John buys 5 pencils at $10 each.
   - Total cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Cost per pencil
   \[
   \text{Total cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money John has left after buying the pencils.**
   - Money left after buying pencils = Remaining money - Total cost of pencils
   \[
   \text{Money left after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many $25 pens John can buy with the remaining money.**
   - Number of pens = Money left after pencils ÷ Cost per pen
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4
   \]

Finally, after working through all the steps, we find that John can buy **4 pens** after purchasing the pencils.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Calculate John's total earnings:
* Hourly rate = $50
* Hours worked = 6
* Total earnings = $50 × 6 = $300

2. Subtract gas expense:
* Gas cost = $50
* Money after gas = $300 - $50 = $250

3. Subtract bank deposit:
* Bank deposit = $100
* Money after deposit = $250 - $100 = $150

4. Calculate and subtract pencil cost:
* Each pencil costs $10
* Number of pencils = 5
* Total pencil cost = $10 × 5 = $50
* Money after...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate how much money John earned in a week. He earns 50 dollars an hour and worked for 6 hours. So, he earned:

50 dollars/hour * 6 hours = 300 dollars

Next, let's calculate how much money he has left after he spends 50 dollars on gas and deposits 100 dollars in the bank:

300 dollars - 50 dollars (for gas) - 100 dollars (for bank deposit) = 150 dollars

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left after he buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each:
