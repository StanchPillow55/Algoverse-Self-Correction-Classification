=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.**
2. **Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.**
3. **Determine how many roses Ford lacks by comparing the total orders to the total he grows.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month (assuming a standard month for this calculation).

\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = \text{roses per week} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all the flower shops in a month.

Now, we will sum the orders from each flower shop for one week and then multiply by the number of weeks in a month.

- First flower shop orders: 20 roses
- Second flower shop orders: 15 roses
- Third flower shop orders: 30 roses

**Total orders per week:**
\[
\text{Total orders per week} = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses}
\]

Now, we calculate the total orders for the month:
\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = \text{Total orders per week} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many roses Ford lacks.

Now, we will find out how many roses Ford lacks by subtracting the total roses he grows from the total orders.

\[
\text{Roses lacking} = \text{Total orders in a month} - \text{Total roses grown in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Roses lacking} = 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses}
\]

### Final Answer:
Ford lacks **100 roses** to supply all the flower shops every month.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many roses Ford grows per month
* Ford grows 40 roses per week
* There are 4 weeks in a month
* Monthly roses = 40 roses/week Ã— 4 weeks
* Monthly roses = 160 roses

2. Next, let's find the total demand from flower shops per week
* First shop: 20 roses
* Second shop: 15 roses  
* Third shop: 30 roses
* Total weekly demand = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week

3. Calculate monthly demand from sh...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses. 

So, the total number of roses needed per week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week, so he lacks 65 - 40 = 25 roses every week to supply all the flower shops.

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month, so Ford lacks 25 * 4 = 100 roses ...
