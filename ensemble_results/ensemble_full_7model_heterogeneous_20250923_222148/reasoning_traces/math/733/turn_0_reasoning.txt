=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem of how much money each person gets when Greg splits the $20 he found with his 3 younger siblings, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of people involved**: 
   - Greg has 3 younger siblings, so the total number of people is:
     \[
     1 \text{ (Greg)} + 3 \text{ (siblings)} = 4 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money to be split**: 
   - The total amount of money found is $20.

3. **Calculate the amount each person gets**: 
   - To find out how much each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money by the total number of people:
     \[
     \text{Amount per person} = \frac{\text{Total amount of money}}{\text{Total number of people}} = \frac{20}{4}
     \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{20}{4} = 5
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Each person, including Greg and his 3 siblings, will receive $5.

Thus, the final answer is that each of them gets **$5**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greg found $20 while walking down the street with his 3 younger siblings.
- He decided to split the money equally among them.

To find the amount of money each person got, we need to divide the total amount of money by the number of people.

Step 1: Determine the total number of people.
Total number of people = Greg + 3 younger siblings = 4 people

Step 2: Divide the total amount of money by t...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of how much money each person gets, we need to divide the total amount of money Greg found by the total number of people who will share it.

**Step 1: Identify the total amount of money.**

Greg found $20.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of people sharing the money.**

Greg has 3 younger siblings, and he is also included in the sharing. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[ 1 \text{ (Greg)} + 3 \text{ (siblings)} = 4 \text{ people} \]

...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, I need to determine the total number of people sharing the money:
   * Greg + 3 younger siblings = 4 people total

2. The total amount of money to split:
   * Found money = $20

3. To split equally, I'll divide the total money by the number of people:
   * $20 รท 4 = $5

4. To verify this is correct:
   * $5 ร 4 = $20 (this confirms each person getting $5 adds up to the total)

Reasoning: Since Greg wanted ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem is asking us to divide $20 equally among Greg and his 3 siblings. This means the money is to be divided among 4 people in total (Greg + 3 siblings = 4 people).

To solve this, we simply divide the total amount of money by the total number of people. 

So, $20 รท 4 = $5

Therefore, each of them got $5.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Greg found $20.
   * He wants to split the money equally among himself and his 3 younger siblings.

2. Determine the total number of people sharing the money:
   * Greg + 3 younger siblings = 4 people in total

3. Divide the total amount of money by the number of people to find each person's share:
   * Total money = $20
   * Number of people = 4
   * Each person...
