=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Calculate how many apples Walter ate:**
   Walter bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]

   So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. **Calculate how many apples remain after eating:**
   After eating 24 apples, the number of apples remaining is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate how many apples Walter gave to his sister:**
   Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. First, we need to find 25% of 36 apples.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   0.25 \times 36 = 9
   \]

   So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.

4. **Calculate how many apples remain after giving some to his sister:**
   The number of apples remaining after giving 9 apples to his sister is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27
   \]

5. **Calculate how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:**
   Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each. The total amount of money he received is:

   \[
   \text{Total money received} = 27 \times 3
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Thus, Walter received a total of **$81** from selling the remaining apples.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Walter bought 60 apples from the store.
- He ate 2/5 of the apples.
- He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
- He then sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

Step 1: Calculate the number of apples Walter ate.
2/5 of 60 apples = 2/5 × 60 = 24 apples

Step 2: Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate his share.
Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36 ap...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question and perform calculations at each step. Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:**

   Walter bought 60 apples initially. He ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]

   So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples remaining after eating:**

   After eating 24 apples, the...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of apples:
* Walter starts with 60 apples

2. Calculate how many apples Walter ate (2/5 of total):
* 2/5 × 60 = 24 apples eaten
* Remaining apples = 60 - 24 = 36 apples

3. Calculate how many apples given to sister (25% of remaining):
* 25% = 25/100 = 1/4
* 1/4 × 36 = 9 apples given to sister
* New remaining apples = 36 - 9 = 27 apples

4. Calculate money received from uncle:
* Each apple costs $3

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Walter initially had 60 apples. He ate 2/5 of them. 

To find out how many apples he ate, we multiply the total number of apples by 2/5:

60 * 2/5 = 24 apples

So, Walter ate 24 apples. 

This means he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left.

Next, Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples. 

To find out how many apples he gave to his sister, we multiply the remaining number of apples by 25/100 (or 0.25):

36 * 0.25 = 9 apples

So, Walter gave his sister 9 apples. 

This m...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Walter bought 60 apples.
   * He ate 2/5 of the apples.
   * He gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.
   * He sold the remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each.

2. Calculate the number of apples Walter ate:
   * Walter ate 2/5 of the apples.
   * 2/5 of 60 = (2 × 60) ÷ 5 = 120 ÷ 5 = 24 apples

3. Calculate the number of apples remaining after Walter ate:
