Final Answer: To determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks, we first need to calculate the amount of material required for each type of mask.

### Step 1: Calculate the material needed for small masks

Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. We can find out how much material is needed for one small mask by dividing the total material by the number of masks:

\[
\text{Material per small mask} = \frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks:

\[
\text{Material for 20 small masks} = 20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the material needed for large masks

Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material. We can find out how much material is needed for one large mask by dividing the total material by the number of masks:

\[
\text{Material per large mask} = \frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
\]

Now, we need to find out how much material is needed for 8 large masks:

\[
\text{Material for 8 large masks} = 8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total material needed

Now, we can find the total amount of material needed by adding the material required for the small masks and the large masks:

\[
\text{Total material needed} = \text{Material for small masks} + \text{Material for large masks}
\]
\[
\text{Total material needed} = 10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
\]

### Final Answer

Jo needs a total of **16 yards** of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of material required to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Given information:
- Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
- Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
- Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much material Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks. We'll do this by calculating the material required for each type of mask separately and then summing the results.

### Step 1: Calculate Material for Small Masks

Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material. We need to find out how much material is needed for 20 small masks.

First, determine the amount of material needed for one small mask:
\[
\text{Ma...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's understand what we know:
* 2 yards of material → 4 small masks
* 2.25 yards of material → 3 large masks
* Need to make: 20 small masks and 8 large masks

2. Let's find material needed for small masks:
* If 2 yards makes 4 small masks
* To find yards per small mask: 2 ÷ 4 = 0.5 yards per small mask
* For 20 small masks: 20 × 0.5 = 10 yards needed for small masks

3. Let's find material needed for larg...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

For the small masks, she can make 4 with 2 yards of material. Therefore, to make one small mask, she would need 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yard of material.

For the large masks, she can make 3 with 2.25 yards of material. Therefore, to make one large mask, she would need 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yard of material.

Now, let's calculate how much material she would need to make 20 small masks a...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jo can make 4 small masks with 2 yards of material.
   * Jo can make 3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material.
   * Jo needs to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

2. Calculate the amount of material needed for the small masks:
   * 4 small masks require 2 yards of material.
   * To find the material needed for 1 small mask, divide 2 yards by 4:
     2 yards ÷ 4 =...
