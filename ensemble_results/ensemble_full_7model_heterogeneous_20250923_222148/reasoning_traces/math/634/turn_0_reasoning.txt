=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of fish caught by Tommy, Darren, and Naomi based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of fish caught by Naomi**:
   - We know from the problem that Naomi caught 17 fish.

2. **Determine how many fish Darren caught**:
   - The problem states that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. 
   - Since Naomi caught 17 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Darren caught as follows:
     \[
     \text{Darren's fish} = \text{Naomi's fish} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11
     \]
   - Therefore, Darren caught 11 fish.

3. **Determine how many fish Tommy caught**:
   - The problem states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.
   - Since we found that Darren caught 11 fish, we can calculate the number of fish Tommy caught as follows:
     \[
     \text{Tommy's fish} = \text{Darren's fish} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
     \]
   - Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Tommy caught **14 fish**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.
- Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi.
- Naomi caught 17 fish.

Step 1: Find how many fish Darren caught.
Naomi caught 17 fish.
Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, so:
Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6 = 11 fish

Step 2: Find how many fish Tommy caught.
Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so:
Tommy's fish = Darren's fish + 3
Tomm...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Naomi caught 17 fish
* Darren caught 6 less than Naomi
* Tommy caught 3 more than Darren

2. Let's find how many fish Darren caught:
* Darren = Naomi - 6
* Darren = 17 - 6
* Darren = 11 fish

3. Now we can find how many fish Tommy caught:
* Tommy = Darren + 3
* Tommy = 11 + 3
* Tommy = 14 fish

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

To verify:
* Naomi caught 17 fish
* Darren caugh...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many fish Darren caught. We know that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Since Naomi caught 17 fish, we subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught.

17 - 6 = 11

So, Darren caught 11 fish.

Next, we need to find out how many fish Tommy caught. We know that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. Since Darren caught 11 fish, we add 3 to 11 to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start with the information given and work our way to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

Given:
- Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.
- Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi.
- Naomi caught 17 fish.

Step 1: Determine the number of fish Darren caught.
Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi.
Darren's fish = Naomi's fish - 6
Darren's fish = 17 - 6 = 11
So, Darren caught 11 fish.
