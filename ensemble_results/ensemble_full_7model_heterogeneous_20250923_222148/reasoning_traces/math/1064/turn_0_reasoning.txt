=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we will calculate the number of classes that visited each day from Monday to Friday and then sum those numbers.

1. **Monday**: 
   - The problem states that 32 classes visited on Monday.
   - So, the number of classes on Monday = 32.

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - It is stated that twice as many classes visited on Tuesday as on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of classes on Tuesday = 2 × 32 = 64.

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - The problem indicates that three times as many classes visited on Wednesday as on Monday.
   - Thus, the number of classes on Wednesday = 3 × 32 = 96.

4. **Thursday**: 
   - The problem states that 30 classes visited on Thursday.
   - So, the number of classes on Thursday = 30.

5. **Friday**: 
   - It is given that 25 classes visited on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of classes on Friday = 25.

Now, we will sum the number of classes that visited each day:

\[
\text{Total classes} = \text{Classes on Monday} + \text{Classes on Tuesday} + \text{Classes on Wednesday} + \text{Classes on Thursday} + \text{Classes on Friday}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total classes} = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

1. \(32 + 64 = 96\)
2. \(96 + 96 = 192\)
3. \(192 + 30 = 222\)
4. \(222 + 25 = 247\)

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of classes that visited the Science Center each day and then add them up to get the total number of classes that visited last week.

Given information:
- On Monday, 32 classes visited.
- On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday.
- On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday.
- On Thursday, 30 classes visited.
- On Friday, 25 classes visited.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of classes that visited the Science Center over the course of the week, from Monday to Friday. We will calculate the number of classes for each day and then sum them up.

1. **Monday:**
   - The problem states that 32 classes visited on Monday.

2. **Tuesday:**
   - Twice as many classes visited on Tuesday as on Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of classes on Tuesday is \(2 \times 32 = 64\).

3. **Wednesday:**...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the number of classes each day:
   * Monday: 32 classes
   * Tuesday: 2 × 32 = 64 classes (twice as many as Monday)
   * Wednesday: 3 × 32 = 96 classes (three times as many as Monday)
   * Thursday: 30 classes
   * Friday: 25 classes

2. Now, let's add up all the classes for the week:
   * Total = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday
   * Total = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25

3. Let's ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem day by day.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday. So, 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday. So, 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited on Wednesday.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Monday: 
   * 32 classes visited on Monday.

2. Tuesday:
   * Twice as many classes visited on Tuesday compared to Monday.
   * Monday's classes = 32
   * Tuesday's classes = 32 × 2 = 64

3. Wednesday:
   * Three times as many classes visited on Wednesday compared to Monday.
   * Monday's classes = 32
   * Wednesday's classes = 32 × 3 = 96

4. Thursday:
   * 30 classes visited on Thursday.

5. Friday:
   * ...
