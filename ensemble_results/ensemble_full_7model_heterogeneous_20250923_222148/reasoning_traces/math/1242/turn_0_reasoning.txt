=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of red hats**:
   - Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
   - According to the problem, half of the hats are red.
   - Therefore, the number of red hats is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining hats after accounting for the red hats**:
   - After taking out the red hats, the number of remaining hats is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
     \]

3. **Determine the number of blue hats**:
   - The problem states that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue.
   - To find the number of blue hats, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats**:
   - Now, we know the total number of hats and how many are red and blue. We can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats:
     \[
     \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (\text{Number of red hats} + \text{Number of blue hats})
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (50 + 30) = 100 - 80 = 20
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of white hats Skyler has is:
     \[
     \boxed{20}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Skyler has 100 hats in total
- Half of the hats are red
- 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue
- The rest are white

Step 1: Calculate the number of red hats.
Half of 100 hats = 100 / 2 = 50 red hats

Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining hats (non-red hats).
Total hats - Red hats = Remaining hats
100 - 50 = 50 remaining hats

Step 3: Calculate the number of blue hats.
3/5 of the remain...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hats of each color Skyler has, specifically focusing on finding the number of white hats.

1. **Determine the number of red hats:**
   - Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
   - Half of the hats are red.
   - Therefore, the number of red hats is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   - Total hats = 100
   - Red hats = 50
   - Remaining ha...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Total hats = 100
* Half (1/2) of hats are red
* 3/5 of remaining hats are blue
* The rest are white

2. Calculate red hats:
* Red hats = 1/2 × 100
* Red hats = 50 hats

3. Find remaining hats after red:
* Remaining hats = Total hats - Red hats
* Remaining hats = 100 - 50
* Remaining hats = 50 hats

4. Calculate blue hats:
* Blue hats = 3/5 × remaining hats
* Blue hats = 3/5 ×...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we simply divide the total number of hats by 2:

100 / 2 = 50 red hats

Next, we subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats to find out how many hats are not red:

100 - 50 = 50 hats are not red

Now, we know that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. To find out how many blue hats there are, we multiply the number of non-red hats by 3/5:

50 * 3/5 = 30 blue hats

Finally,...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
   * Half of the hats are red.
   * 3/5 of the remaining hats (after taking out the red ones) are blue.
   * The rest of the hats are white.

2. Calculate the number of red hats:
   * Half of the total hats are red.
   * Number of red hats = 1/2 × 100
   * Number of red hats = 50

3. Calculate the number of remaining hats after tak...
