Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of insects each person found and then set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( L \) = number of insects Lily found
- \( D \) = number of insects David found
- \( B \) = number of insects Bodhi found

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + 7
\]

Now we have expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \)
- \( L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \)

Next, substitute these into the first equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, isolate \( B \):
\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2}(18) = 9
\]

Next, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Now we have:
- \( L = 16 \)
- \( D = 9 \)
- \( B = 18 \)

Finally, we can check our work by verifying that the total number of insects adds up to 43:
\[
L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
\]

Since this is correct, we conclude that the number of insects Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

=== INDIVIDUAL MODEL RESPONSES ===

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of insects each person found and then set up equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( L \) = number of insects Lily found
- \( D \) = number of insects David found
- \( B \) = number of insects Bodhi found

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of insects Bodhi found.
- Then, David found x/2 insects.
- And Lily found (x/2) + 7 insects.

Now, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of insects Lily found.

Step 1: Find the total number of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to define variables for the number of insects each person found and set up equations based on the information given.

Let's define:
- \( L \) as the number of insects Lily found.
- \( D \) as the number of insects David found.
- \( B \) as the number of insects Bodhi found.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Total insects collected = 43
* Lily found 7 more than David
* David found half of what Bodhi found

Let's solve:
1. Let's express David's insects in terms of Bodhi's
* If David found half of Bodhi's insects
* David = Bodhi รท 2

2. Let's express Lily's insects in terms of David's
* Lily = David + 7

3. We know total insects = 43
* Lily + David + Bodhi = 43
* (David + 7) + David + (David ร 2) = 43
* Substitut...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as L, D, and B respectively.

From the problem, we know that:

L + D + B = 43 (equation 1)

Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write this as:

L = D + 7 (equation 2)

David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write this as:

D = B/2 (equation 3)

Now, we can substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1 to solve for the variables.

Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:

(D + 7) + D + B = 43

Given:
- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected a total of 43 insects.
- Lily found 7 more insects than David.
- David found half of what Bodhi found.

Step 1: Let's express the number of insects each person found in terms of a variable.
