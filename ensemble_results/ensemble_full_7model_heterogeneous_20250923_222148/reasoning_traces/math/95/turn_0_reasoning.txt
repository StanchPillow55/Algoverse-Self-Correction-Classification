Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps.

### Step 1: Determine the number of boys and girls

We know that there are a total of 200 Grade 5 students. According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of these students are boys.

**Calculating the number of boys:**
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200
\]
\[
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

**Calculating the number of girls:**
Since the total number of students is 200, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total:
\[
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - \text{Number of boys} = 200 - 80 = 120
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many girls are in the girl scout

According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout.

**Calculating the number of girls in the girl scout:**
\[
\text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many girls are not in the girl scout

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:
\[
\text{Number of girls not in girl scout} = \text{Total number of girls} - \text{Number of girls in girl scout}
\]
\[
\text{Number of girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
\]

### Final Answer

The number of girls who are not in the girl scout is \( \boxed{40} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of girls who are not in the Girl Scouts.

Given information:
- There are 200 Grade 5 students.
- 2/5 of the students are boys.
- 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scouts.

Step 1: Find the number of boys.
Number of boys = 2/5 × 200 = 80 boys

Step 2: Find the number of girls.
Number of girls = Total students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many girls are not in the girl scout. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of boys:**
   - We know that 2/5 of the 200 Grade 5 students are boys.
   - To find the number of boys, multiply the total number of students by the fraction that represents the boys:
     \[
     \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = \frac{2 \times 200}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
     \]

2. **Determine the n...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Find the number of boys:
* Total students = 200
* Boys = 2/5 of total
* Number of boys = 200 × 2/5 = 80 boys

2. Find the number of girls:
* Total = Boys + Girls
* 200 = 80 + Girls
* Girls = 200 - 80 = 120 girls

3. Find girls in girl scout:
* 2/3 of girls are in girl scout
* Girls in scout = 120 × 2/3 = 80 girls in scout

4. Find girls not in girl scout:
* Total girls - Girls in scout
* 120 - 80 = 40 girls not i...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many boys and girls there are in the 5th grade. 

We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. So, we multiply 200 (the total number of students) by 2/5 to find the number of boys:

200 * 2/5 = 80 boys

Since the rest of the students are girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students to find the number of girls:

200 - 80 = 120 girls

We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we multiply 120 (the total n...
