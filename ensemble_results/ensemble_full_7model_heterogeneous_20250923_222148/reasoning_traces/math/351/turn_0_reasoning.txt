=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many plant pots April will have left after fulfilling the school's request.

1. **Determine the number of plant pots needed for the daisies**:
   The school requests 30 plant pots for the daisies.

   \[
   \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 30
   \]

2. **Determine the number of plant pots needed for the roses**:
   The school asks for twice as many plant pots for the roses as they do for the daisies. Therefore, we calculate the number of pots needed for the roses as follows:

   \[
   \text{Plant pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Plant pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of plant pots needed**:
   Now, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses together:

   \[
   \text{Total plant pots needed} = \text{Plant pots for daisies} + \text{Plant pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]

4. **Determine how many plant pots April has**:
   April initially bought 100 plant pots from the garden center.

   \[
   \text{Total plant pots April has} = 100
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of plant pots left over**:
   To find out how many plant pots April has left after donating the required pots, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the total number of pots she has:

   \[
   \text{Plant pots left over} = \text{Total plant pots April has} - \text{Total plant pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of plant pots April has left over is:

   \[
   \boxed{10}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
- The school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies.
- April had already bought 100 plant pots before knowing how many she needed.

Step 1: Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses.
Number of plant pots needed for the roses = 2 × 30 = 60 plant pots

Step 2: Calculate the total number of plant pots need...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* April has 100 plant pots in total
* The school needs 30 pots for daisies
* The school needs twice as many pots for roses as daisies

2. Calculate how many pots are needed for roses:
* Pots for roses = 2 × pots for daisies
* Pots for roses = 2 × 30 = 60 pots

3. Calculate total pots needed by the school:
* Total pots needed = Pots for daisies + Pots for roses
* Total pots need...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to figure out how many plant pots the school needs for the roses. Since they need twice as many for the roses as they do for the daisies, we multiply the number of pots for the daisies by 2. 

30 daisy pots * 2 = 60 rose pots

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots the school needs.

30 daisy pots + 60 rose pots = 90 pots needed in total

April had originally bought 100 pots, so to find out how ...

   * The school needs 30 plant pots for the daisies.
   * The school needs twice as many plant pots for the roses as for the daisies.
   * April bought 100 plant pots before knowing the school's requirements.

2. Calculate the number of plant pots needed for the roses:
   * Plant pots for roses = 2 × Plant pots for daisies
   * Plant pots for roses = 2 × 30
   * Plant po...
