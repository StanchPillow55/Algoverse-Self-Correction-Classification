=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many recipes John learns in his cooking class, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of class hours**:
   - The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time.
   - The total number of weeks is 6.

   First, we calculate the total number of classes:
   \[
   \text{Total classes} = \text{Classes per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ classes}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total hours of class time:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Total classes} \times \text{Hours per class} = 24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Determine how many recipes John learns**:
   - John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

   To find out how many recipes he learns, we divide the total hours of class time by the hours it takes to learn one recipe:
   \[
   \text{Number of recipes} = \frac{\text{Total hours}}{\text{Hours per recipe}} = \frac{48}{1.5}
   \]

   To perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{48}{1.5} = 48 \div 1.5
   \]

   We can convert 1.5 to a fraction:
   \[
   1.5 = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the division as:
   \[
   48 \div 1.5 = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{48 \times 2}{3} = \frac{96}{3} = 32
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   John learns a total of **32 recipes** during his cooking class.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To determine how many recipes John learns in his cooking class, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of class hours**:
   - The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time.
   - The total number of weeks is 6.

   First, we calculate the total number of classes:
   \[

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The cooking class meets 4 times a week.
- Each class session lasts 2 hours.
- The class runs for 6 weeks.
- John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours in the cooking class.
Number of hours per week = 4 classes × 2 hours per class = 8 hours per week
Total number of hours in the class = 8 hours per week × 6 weeks = 48 hou...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many total hours John spends in the cooking class and then calculate how many recipes he learns based on the given rate of learning a new recipe every 1.5 hours.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Class Hours per Week
John's cooking class meets 4 times a week, and each session is 2 hours long. Therefore, the total number of hours he spends in class per week is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = 4 \, \text{se...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total hours of class time:
   * Classes per week = 4 times
   * Hours per class = 2 hours
   * Number of weeks = 6 weeks
   * Total hours = 4 × 2 × 6
   * Total hours = 48 hours

2. Now, let's find how many recipes he learns:
   * He learns 1 recipe per 1.5 hours
   * To find total recipes, divide total hours by hours per recipe
   * Number of recipes = 48 ÷ 1.5
   * Number of recipes = 32

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total amount of class time John has. The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time, so that's 4 classes/week * 2 hours/class = 8 hours/week. 

The class lasts for 6 weeks, so the total class time is 8 hours/week * 6 weeks = 48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, to find out how many recipes he learns, we need to divide the total class time by the time it takes to learn each recipe. 

That's 48 hours / 1...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The class meets 4 times a week.
   * Each class is 2 hours long.
   * The course lasts for 6 weeks.
   * John learns a new recipe every 1.5 hours of class time.

2. Calculate the total number of class hours in a week:
   * Class hours per week = Number of classes per week × Hours per class
   * Class hours per week = 4 × 2
   * Class hours per week = 8 hours

3. Calcul...
