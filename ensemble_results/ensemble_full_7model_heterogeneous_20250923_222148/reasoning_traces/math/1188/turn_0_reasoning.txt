=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine Jim's current age based on the information provided about John and their ages when Digimon was released.

1. **Identify Current Age of John**: 
   - We know that John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine John's Age When Digimon Was Released**:
   - Digimon had its 20th anniversary, which means it was released 20 years ago.
   - Therefore, John's age at the time of the release was:
     \[
     28 \text{ (current age)} - 20 \text{ (years since release)} = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Relationship Between John and Jim's Ages**:
   - The problem states that when Digimon was released, John was twice as old as Jim.
   - Let Jim's age at that time be represented as \( x \).
   - According to the information given:
     \[
     8 = 2x
     \]

4. **Solve for Jim's Age at the Time of Release**:
   - To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x = \frac{8}{2} = 4
     \]
   - So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon was released.

5. **Determine Jim's Current Age**:
   - Since Digimon was released 20 years ago, we can calculate Jim's current age by adding 20 years to his age at the time of the release:
     \[
     4 \text{ (age at release)} + 20 \text{ (years since release)} = 24
     \]

Thus, Jim is currently **24 years old**.

Final Answer: Jim is 24 years old.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find Jim's age based on the given information about John's age.

Given information:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 now.

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out.
John's age now - Years since Digimon came out = John's age when Digimon came out
28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out.
Since John was twice...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine Jim's age based on the information given about John and the timeline of the Digimon anniversary.

1. **Identify the current age of John:**
   - John is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine the number of years ago Digimon came out:**
   - Since it is the 20th anniversary of Digimon, it came out 20 years ago.

3. **Calculate John's age when Digimon came out:**
   - If John is 28 years old now, we can find his age 20 years ago ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- This is Digimon's 20th anniversary
- When Digimon came out, John was twice Jim's age
- John is 28 now

Step 1: Find John's age when Digimon came out
* Current age = 28
* Years since Digimon came out = 20
* John's age when Digimon came out = 28 - 20 = 8 years old

Step 2: Find Jim's age when Digimon came out
* John was twice Jim's age
* John's age = 8
* So Jim's age = 8 รท 2 = 4 years old

Step 3: Find Jim's ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote John's age when Digimon came out as J1 and Jim's age as J2. We know from the problem that J1 = 2*J2.

We also know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary and John is now 28 years old. This means that when Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. So, J1 = 8.

Now we can substitute J1 into the first equation: 8 = 2*J2. To find J2, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: J2 = 8 / 2 = 4.

So, when Digimon came out, Jim was 4 years old.

Now, to find ou...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the information given to set up an equation and solve for Jim's current age.

Given:
- Digimon had its 20th anniversary, meaning it came out 20 years ago.
- When Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim.
- John is 28 years old now.

Step 1: Let's express John's age 20 years ago in terms of Jim's age at that time.
John's age 20 years ago = 2 ร Jim's age 20 years ago

Step 2: Express John's ...
