=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes that Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by the equation:

\[
B = 5S - 4
\]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes (strawberry cubes plus blueberry cubes) is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
S + B = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

Now, simplify the equation:

\[
S + 5S - 4 = 116
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]

Next, we will isolate \( S \) by first adding 4 to both sides:

\[
6S = 116 + 4
\]
\[
6S = 120
\]

Now, divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the equation for \( B \):

\[
B = 5S - 4
\]
\[
B = 5(20) - 4
\]
\[
B = 100 - 4
\]
\[
B = 96
\]

Thus, the number of blueberry cubes that Mary makes is:

\[
\boxed{96}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mary makes some strawberry cubes.
- The number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.
- The total number of ice cubes made is 116.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of strawberry cubes
- Let y = the number of blueberry cubes

We know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so:
y ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many blueberry cubes Mary makes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of strawberry cubes.
   - Let \( B \) represent the number of blueberry cubes.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     B = 5S - 4
     \]
   - We also...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define variables:
   * Let s = number of strawberry cubes
   * Let b = number of blueberry cubes

2) We know:
   * Total cubes = 116
   * Blueberry cubes = 5 Ã— strawberry cubes - 4
   * So b = 5s - 4

3) We can write an equation:
   * Total = strawberry cubes + blueberry cubes
   * 116 = s + b
   * 116 = s + (5s - 4)

4) Simplify the right side:
   * 116 = s + 5s - 4
   * 116 = 6s - 4

5) Solve for s:
   * ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B.

According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) B = 5S - 4 (the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4)

2) S + B = 116 (the total number of cubes is 116)

We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for S:

S + 5S - 4 = 116
6S - 4 = 116
6S = 120
S = 20

Now we can substitute S = 20 into the first equation to find B:

B = 5*...
