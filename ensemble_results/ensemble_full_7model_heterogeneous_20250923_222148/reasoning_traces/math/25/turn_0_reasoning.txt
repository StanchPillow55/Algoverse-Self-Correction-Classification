Final Answer: To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we need to first calculate the total cost of the other items she purchased and then determine how much money she had left for the pizza.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**
   - Cost of chicken meal = $12

2. **Calculate the cost of the packs of milk:**
   - Cost of one pack of milk = $3
   - Number of packs of milk = 5
   - Total cost of milk = 5 packs × $3/pack = $15

3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   - Cost of one apple = $1.50
   - Number of apples = 4
   - Total cost of apples = 4 apples × $1.50/apple = $6

4. **Calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:**
   - Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = Cost of chicken meal + Cost of milk + Cost of apples
   - Total cost = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

5. **Determine how much money Marie had left for the pizza:**
   - Total amount paid by Marie = $50
   - Amount spent on chicken meal, milk, and apples = $33
   - Amount left for pizza = Total amount paid - Amount spent on other items
   - Amount left for pizza = $50 - $33 = $17

6. **Calculate how many boxes of pizza Marie can buy:**
   - Cost of one box of pizza = $8.50
   - Let \( x \) be the number of boxes of pizza.
   - The total cost of the pizza can be expressed as \( 8.50x \).
   - We know that the total amount left for pizza is $17, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     8.50x = 17
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 8.50:
     \[
     x = \frac{17}{8.50}
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     x \approx 2
     \]

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - To confirm, we can calculate how much $2 boxes of pizza would cost:
     \[
     2 \times 8.50 = 17
     \]
   - This matches the amount Marie had left for pizza.

Thus, the number of boxes of pizza that Marie ordered is \( \boxed{2} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 1 chicken meal that costs $12
- 5 packs of milk that cost $3 each
- 4 apples that cost $1.50 each
- Some boxes of pizza that cost $8.50 each
- Total amount paid is $50

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken meal, milk, and apples.
Cost of chicken meal = $12
Cost of 5 packs of milk = 5 × $3 = $15
Cost of 4 apples = 4 × $1.50 = $6

Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples = $12 + $1...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the known costs:
* Chicken meal = $12
* Milk = $3 × 5 packs = $15
* Apples = $1.50 × 4 = $6
* Each pizza box = $8.50
* Total paid = $50

2. Let's add up all the known items:
* Chicken meal + Milk + Apples
* $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

3. To find the cost of pizza boxes:
* Total - Known items = Cost of pizza boxes
* $50 - $33 = $17 spent on pizza boxes

4. To find number of pizza boxes:
* Cost of p...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.

The chicken meal costs $12.

The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.

The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

Adding these together, the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples cost $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 (total) - $33 (cost of other items) = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so th...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by calculating the total cost of the items Marie ordered, excluding the pizza boxes. Then, we'll subtract that amount from the total she paid to determine how much money was spent on pizza boxes. Finally, we'll divide the remaining amount by the cost per pizza box to find out how many boxes she ordered.

Given:
- 1 chicken meal costs $12
- 5 packs of milk cost $3 each
- 4 apples cost $1.50 each
-...
