=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - We can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     23 - 5 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, Gomer ate **18 scoops of mashed potatoes**.

2. **Determine how many potatoes are needed for one scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - First, we calculate how many potatoes it takes:
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \quad \text{(this is the number of potatoes)}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate how many scoops of mashed potatoes this corresponds to:
     \[
     3 - 1 = 2 \quad \text{(this is the number of scoops)}
     \]
   - Thus, 3 potatoes are needed to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, we can find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop:
     \[
     \text{Potatoes per scoop} = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Since Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, we can find the total number of potatoes he consumed:
     \[
     \text{Total potatoes} = 18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     18 \times 1.5 = 27
     \]

Thus, Gomer ate a total of **27 potatoes**.

### Final Answer:
Gomer ate **27 potatoes**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many scoops Gomer ate
* Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops
* 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes

2. Next, let's figure out the ratio of potatoes to scoops
* It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes (so 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes)
* To make 1 less than 3 scoops (so 3 - 1 = 2 scoops)
* So the ratio is: 3 potatoes = 2 scoops
* Or: 1.5 potatoes = 1 scoop

3. Now we can calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate
* If ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we subtract 5 from 23:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we subtract 3 from 6:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes

And we subtract 1 from 3:

3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoe...
