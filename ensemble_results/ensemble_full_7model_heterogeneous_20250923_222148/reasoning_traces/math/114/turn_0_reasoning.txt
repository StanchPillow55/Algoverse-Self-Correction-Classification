Final Answer: To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the relationship between Jamal's and Brittany's phones**:
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     J = 6B
     \]
   - Where \( J \) is the maximum number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold.

2. **Using the information given about Jamal's phone**:
   - We are told that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - So, we set \( J = 1800 \):
     \[
     1800 = 6B
     \]

3. **Solving for \( B \)**:
   - To find \( B \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - Thus, Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 300 photographs.

4. **Understanding the relationship between Brittany's phone and the number of birds**:
   - We are also told that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold (which we found to be 300) is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of ducks (or birds) in Jamal's photograph.
   - The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     B = 50D
     \]
   - Substituting \( B = 300 \) into the equation gives:
     \[
     300 = 50D
     \]

5. **Solving for \( D \)**:
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:
     \[
     D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is:
     \[
     \boxed{6}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
- The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Step 1: Find the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) represent t...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify the key relationships:
* Jamal's phone capacity = 6 × Brittany's phone capacity
* Brittany's phone capacity = 50 × number of ducks in photo
* We know Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photos

2. Let's find Brittany's phone capacity:
* Jamal's capacity = 6 × Brittany's capacity
* 1800 = 6 × Brittany's capacity
* Brittany's capacity = 1800 ÷ 6
* Brittany's capacity = 300 photos

3. Now find number of ducks...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So, if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph is 300/50...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   * Brittany's phone can hold a maximum of 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   * Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

2. Let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
   * Jamal's phone capacity = 6 × Brittany's phone capacity
