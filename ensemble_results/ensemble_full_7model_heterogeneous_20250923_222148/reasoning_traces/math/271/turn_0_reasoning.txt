Final Answer: To find the total number of windows in John's two houses, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of bedrooms in both houses:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.
   - Since John has 2 houses, the total number of bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedrooms} = 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 6 \text{ bedrooms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the total number of windows in all the bedrooms is:
     \[
     \text{Total bedroom windows} = 6 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 12 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of additional windows in each house:**
   - Each house has an additional 4 windows that are not connected to bedrooms.
   - For 2 houses, the total number of additional windows is:
     \[
     \text{Total additional windows} = 4 \text{ windows/house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 8 \text{ windows}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in both houses:**
   - Now, we add the total number of bedroom windows and the total number of additional windows:
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = \text{Total bedroom windows} + \text{Total additional windows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total windows} = 12 \text{ windows} + 8 \text{ windows} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

Thus, the total number of windows between the two houses is \( \boxed{20} \).

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in both of John's houses. We will break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bedrooms in each house:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate windows in bedrooms per house:
* Each bedroom has 2 windows
* Each house has 3 bedrooms
* So windows in bedrooms per house = 2 windows × 3 bedrooms = 6 windows

2. Add the additional windows per house:
* Each house has 4 additional windows
* Total windows per house = 6 bedroom windows + 4 additional windows = 10 windows

3. Calculate total windows for both houses:
* Number of houses = 2
* T...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. Since each house has 3 bedrooms and each bedroom has 2 windows, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for each house is 3 bedrooms * 2 windows/bedroom = 6 windows.

Since John has 2 houses, the total number of windows in the bedrooms for both houses is 2 houses * 6 windows/house = 12 windows.

Next, let's add the additional windows that are not in the bedrooms. Since each house has an additional 4 w...
