=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine based on the information provided about the blue gumballs.

1. **Identify the Variables**:
   - Let \( b \) represent the number of blue gumballs.
   - Let \( p \) represent the number of pink gumballs.

2. **Given Information**:
   - We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can set \( b = 12 \).
   - The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs as there are pink gumballs. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     p = 4b + 22
     \]

3. **Substituting the Value of \( b \)**:
   - Now we substitute \( b = 12 \) into the equation:
     \[
     p = 4(12) + 22
     \]

4. **Calculating \( p \)**:
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 12 \):
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48
     \]
   - Next, add 22 to this result:
     \[
     48 + 22 = 70
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Therefore, the number of pink gumballs \( p \) is:
     \[
     p = 70
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of pink gumballs in the candy machine is \( \boxed{70} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 22 more than four times the number of pink gumballs as there are blue gumballs.
- There are 12 blue gumballs.

Step 1: Find the relationship between the number of pink gumballs and the number of blue gumballs.
Let x = the number of blue gumballs
Then, the number of pink gumballs = 4x + 22

Step 2: Substitute the given information about the number of blue gumballs.
Since there ar...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of pink gumballs in the candy machine given the relationship between the number of pink and blue gumballs.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 12 blue gumballs.
   - The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

2. **Translate the problem into a mathematical expression:**

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* There are 12 blue gumballs
* The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the blue gumballs

2) Let's find four times the number of blue gumballs:
* 4 × 12 = 48 blue gumballs

3) The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than this amount:
* 48 + 22 = 70 pink gumballs

4) Let's verify this makes sense:
* We have 12 blue gumballs
* Four times that is 48
* Adding 22 more gives u...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as P and the number of blue gumballs as B.

According to the problem, we have the following relationship:

P = 4B + 22

We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

P = 4*12 + 22 = 48 + 22 = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 12 blue gumballs in the candy machine.
   * The number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs.

2. Let's express the number of pink gumballs in terms of the number of blue gumballs:
   * Number of pink gumballs = (4 × Number of blue gumballs) + 22

3. Now, we can substitute the number of blue gumballs (12) into the expre...
