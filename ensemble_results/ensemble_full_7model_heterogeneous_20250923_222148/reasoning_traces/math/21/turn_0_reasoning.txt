=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Samantha's Age**: 
   - We know that Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Calculate Raymond's Age**: 
   - Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 years to Samantha's age:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine the Age at Which Raymond Had His Son**: 
   - The problem states that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.

4. **Calculate the Age of Raymond's Son**: 
   - To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we need to determine how many years have passed since Raymond was 23. Since Raymond is currently 37 years old, we can calculate the difference:
   \[
   \text{Years since Raymond had his son} = \text{Raymond's current age} - \text{Age when he had his son} = 37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Raymond's son and then calculate how many years ago he was born.

Given information:
- Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
- Raymond had a son at the age of 23.
- Samantha is now 31 years old.

Step 1: Find Raymond's age.
Samantha's current age = 31 years
Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha
Raymond's age = Samantha's age - 6 years
Raymond's age = 31 - 6 = 25 years

Step 2: Find the age of Ra...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Raymond's son and how many years ago he was born. We will work through the problem step by step.

1. **Determine Samantha's Current Age:**
   - We are given that Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Determine Raymond's Current Age:**
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Therefore, Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha.
   - Since Samantha is 31 years old, Raymond's current age is:
     \[
     31 + 6 ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's establish Raymond's age
* Samantha is 31 now
* Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha
* So Raymond's current age = 31 + 6 = 37 years old

2. Find when Raymond's son was born
* Raymond had his son at age 23
* Raymond is now 37
* Years since son was born = 37 - 23 = 14 years

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

To verify:
* Raymond is currently 37
* His son was born when Raymond was 23
* 37 - 2...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. So, when Samantha is 31 years old, Raymond would be 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old. So, his son is now 37 - 23 = 14 years old.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   * Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.
   * Samantha is now 31 years old.

2. Calculate Samantha's current age:
   * Samantha's current age = 31 years old

3. Calculate Raymond's current age:
   * Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we add 6 years to Samantha's current age.
   * Raymond's current age = ...
