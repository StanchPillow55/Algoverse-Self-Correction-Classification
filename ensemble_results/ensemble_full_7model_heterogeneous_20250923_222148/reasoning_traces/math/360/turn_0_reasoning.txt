=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify Carver's age**: Carver is currently 45 years old.

2. **Set up the relationship**: The problem states that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically. Let \( s \) represent the age of Carver's son. According to the problem, we can write the equation as follows:

   \[
   45 = 2s - 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( s \)**: We need to isolate \( s \) in the equation. First, we will add 5 to both sides of the equation:

   \[
   45 + 5 = 2s
   \]
   \[
   50 = 2s
   \]

4. **Divide both sides by 2**: To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   s = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = 25
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: Carver's son is 25 years old.

Thus, the final answer is that Carver's son is **25 years old**.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the age of Carver's son based on the given information.

Given information:
- Carver just turned 45 years old.
- Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

Let's represent the age of Carver's son as x.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the relationship between Carver's age and his son's age.
Carver's age = 2 × (Carver's son's age) - 5
45 = 2x - 5

Step 2: Solve the equation for the age of...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Carver's son based on the information given about Carver's age.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Information Given:**
   - Carver is 45 years old.
   - Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( s \) represent the age of Carver's son.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, Carver's age (45 years) is 5 years les...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
* Carver is 45 years old
* Carver's age is 5 years less than twice his son's age

Let's solve:
1. Let's say son's age = x years
2. Twice son's age = 2x years
3. Carver's age is 5 years less than twice son's age
   * So: 45 = 2x - 5
4. Solve for x:
   * 45 = 2x - 5
   * 45 + 5 = 2x
   * 50 = 2x
   * x = 50 ÷ 2
   * x = 25

Check:
* Son's age = 25 years
* Twice son's age = 2 × 25 = 50 years
* Carver's age (45) ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the age of Carver's son as x. 

According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as an equation: 

2x - 5 = 45 

To solve for x, we first add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:

2x = 45 + 5 
2x = 50 

Then, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 50 / 2 
x = 25 

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the age of Carver's son.

Given:
- Carver is 45 years old.
- Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son.

Step 1: Let's express Carver's age in terms of his son's age.
Carver's age = 2 × (Son's age) - 5

Step 2: We know Carver's age is 45 years old, so let's substitute this value into the equation from Step 1.
45 = 2 × (Son's age) - 5

Step 3: Solve the equation for the son...
