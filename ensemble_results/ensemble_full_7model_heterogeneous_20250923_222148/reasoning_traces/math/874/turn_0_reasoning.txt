=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much Ella would earn after 12 hours of dog walking, we first need to find her hourly rate based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate Ella's hourly rate**:
   Ella earned $33 for 3 hours of work. To find her hourly rate, we divide her total earnings by the number of hours she worked:

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Total Hours}} = \frac{33}{3}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Hourly Rate} = 11
   \]

   So, Ella earns $11 per hour.

2. **Calculate earnings for 12 hours**:
   Now that we know her hourly rate, we can calculate how much she would earn for 12 hours of dog walking. We multiply her hourly rate by the number of hours:

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours} = 11 \times 12
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Earnings for 12 hours} = 132
   \]

Thus, Ella would earn $132 after walking dogs for 12 hours.

**Final Answer**: Ella would earn $132 after 12 hours of dog walking.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find out how much Ella earns per hour (her hourly rate)
   * She earned $33 for 3 hours
   * To find hourly rate: $33 ÷ 3 = $11 per hour

2. Now that we know she earns $11 per hour, we can calculate her earnings for 12 hours
   * Earnings = Hourly rate × Number of hours
   * Earnings = $11 × 12
   * Earnings = $132

Reasoning: Since Ella continues at the same rate, we first found her hourly rate by d...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. We can do this by dividing the total amount she earned ($33) by the total hours she worked (3 hours). 

$33 ÷ 3 hours = $11 per hour

This means Ella earns $11 for every hour she walks dogs.

Next, we need to find out how much she would earn for 12 hours of work. We can do this by multiplying her hourly rate ($11) by the total hours she would work (12 hours).

$11 per hour × 12 hours = $132

So, if Ella continues to...
