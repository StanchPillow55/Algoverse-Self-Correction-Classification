=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles, given that it travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the car in the slow lane.

The car in the fast lane is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed:

\[
\text{Speed of the slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the slow lane car to cover 480 miles.

We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

In this case, the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles/hour. Plugging in these values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation.

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ hours}}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the car in the slow lane and then calculate the time it took to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

Given information:
- The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
- The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.
- The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance as the car in the fast lane, which is 480 miles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the speed of each car:**
   - The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour.
   - The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane. Therefore, the speed of the car in the slow lane is:
     \[
     \text{Speed of slo...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Fast lane car speed = 60 miles/hour
- Slow lane car speed = half of fast lane speed
- Distance covered = 480 miles

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane
* Slow lane speed = Fast lane speed ÷ 2
* Slow lane speed = 60 ÷ 2 = 30 miles/hour

Step 2: Use the formula: Time = Distance ÷ Speed
* We know the distance is 480 miles
* We know the slow lane speed is 30 miles/hour
* Time = 480 ÷ 30
* Ti...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The problem gives us the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 60 miles per hour, and tells us that the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed. Therefore, the car in the slow lane is traveling at 60/2 = 30 miles per hour.

The problem also tells us that the car in the fast lane traveled for a total of 480 miles. We want to find out how long it would take the car in the slow lane to travel the same distance.

We can use the formula for time, which is di...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour.
- The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast car.
- The car in the fast lane traveled a total of 480 miles.

Step 1: Calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane.
Slow car speed = 1/2 × Fast car speed
Slow car speed = 1/2 × 60 miles/hour
Slow car speed = 30 miles/hour

Step 2: Calculate the time taken...
