=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let \( b \) represent the number of blue jelly beans in the jar. According to the problem, we have the following relationships for the red and green jelly beans:

- The number of red jelly beans \( r \) is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans:
  \[
  r = b - 0.01b = 0.99b
  \]

- The number of green jelly beans \( g \) is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans:
  \[
  g = b + 0.01b = 1.01b
  \]

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is given as 4500. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total number of jelly beans:
\[
r + b + g = 4500
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( r \) and \( g \) in terms of \( b \):
\[
0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
\]

Combining the terms on the left side:
\[
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
\]
\[
3.01b = 4500
\]

Now, we can solve for \( b \):
\[
b = \frac{4500}{3.01} \approx 1498.34
\]

Since the number of jelly beans must be a whole number, we round \( b \) to the nearest whole number:
\[
b \approx 1498
\]

Now we can find the values of \( r \) and \( g \):
1. Calculate \( r \):
   \[
   r = 0.99b = 0.99 \times 1498 \approx 1483.02 \approx 1483
   \]

2. Calculate \( g \):
   \[
   g = 1.01b = 1.01 \times 1498 \approx 1512.98 \approx 1513
   \]

Now, we need to find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans:
\[
g - r = 1513 - 1483 = 30
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\] 

This means there are 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans in the jar.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans in the jar, and then calculate the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans.

Given information:
- The jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans.
- The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
- The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red, blue, and green jelly beans in the jar and then find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans.

Let's define:
- \( b \) as the number of blue jelly beans.
- \( r \) as the number of red jelly beans.
- \( g \) as the number of green jelly beans.

According to the problem:
1. The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans. This can be expressed as:

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's define variables:
   * Let b = number of blue jelly beans
   * Then red = 0.99b (1% less than blue)
   * And green = 1.01b (1% more than blue)

2) We know the total number of jelly beans is 4500
   * red + blue + green = 4500
   * 0.99b + b + 1.01b = 4500
   * (0.99 + 1 + 1.01)b = 4500
   * 3b = 4500

3) Solve for b (blue jelly beans)
   * b = 4500 รท 3
   * b = 1500 blue jelly beans

4) Calculate red jelly ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

According to the problem, we know that:

R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B (since there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones)

G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B (since there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones)

We also know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:

R + B + G = 4500

Substituting the expressions for R and G from above, we get:

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The jar contains red, blue, and green jelly beans.
   * The number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans.
   * The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans.
   * The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500.
