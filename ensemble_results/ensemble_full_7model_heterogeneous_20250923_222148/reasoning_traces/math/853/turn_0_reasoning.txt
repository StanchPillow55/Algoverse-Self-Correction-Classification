=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

1. **Determine the total number of rooms**: 
   The problem states that there are 90 rooms at the motel.

2. **Calculate one-half of the rooms**: 
   To find one-half of the rooms, we divide the total number of rooms by 2:
   \[
   \text{One-half of the rooms} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \text{ rooms}
   \]

3. **Determine the time to clean one room**: 
   The problem states that it takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room.

4. **Calculate the total time to clean 45 rooms**: 
   To find the total time to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the number of rooms by the time it takes to clean each room:
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert minutes to hours**: 
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms is **15 hours**.

Final answer: **15 hours**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

Given information:
- There are 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
- It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room.

Step 1: Find the number of rooms that need to be cleaned.
One-half of the total rooms = 90 รท 2 = 45 rooms

Step 2: Calculate the total time it would take to clean 45 rooms.
Time to clean one room = 20 minutes

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it will take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.

**Step 1: Determine the number of rooms to be cleaned.**

The total number of rooms at the KozyInn Motel is 90. We need to clean one-half of these rooms. Therefore, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of rooms to be cleaned} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cleaning time in minutes.**

It takes 20 minutes to clean each room. Theref...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we need to find:
   * We need to find hours to clean half of 90 rooms
   * Each room takes 20 minutes to clean

2. Calculate how many rooms need to be cleaned:
   * Half of 90 rooms = 90 รท 2 = 45 rooms

3. Calculate total minutes needed:
   * Time per room = 20 minutes
   * Total minutes = 45 rooms ร 20 minutes
   * Total minutes = 900 minutes

4. Convert minutes to hours:
   * 1 hour =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many rooms make up one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 

Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half of the rooms would be 90/2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to clean these 45 rooms. 

Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes to clean half of the rooms.

However, the problem asks for the answer in hours, not minutes. 

Since there are 60...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The KozyInn Motel has 90 rooms in total.
   * It takes housekeeping 20 minutes to clean each room.
   * We need to find out how long it would take to clean half of the rooms.

2. Calculate the number of rooms that represent one-half of the total:
   * One-half of the rooms = 90 รท 2
   * One-half of the rooms = 45 rooms

3. Calculate the total time it takes to clean 45 ...
