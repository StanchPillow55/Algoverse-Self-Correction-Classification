=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money John is missing for the school trip, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the trip**: The total cost of the trip is given as $300.

2. **Determine how much the school will cover**: The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip. To find out how much that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cost of the trip}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount covered by the school} = \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150
   \]

3. **Calculate how much John needs to pay**: Since the school is covering $150, we need to find out how much John is responsible for:
   \[
   \text{Amount John needs to pay} = \text{Total cost of the trip} - \text{Amount covered by the school}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount John needs to pay} = 300 - 150 = 150
   \]

4. **Determine how much money John currently has**: John has $50.

5. **Calculate how much money John is missing**: To find out how much more money John needs, we subtract the amount he has from the amount he needs to pay:
   \[
   \text{Amount John is missing} = \text{Amount John needs to pay} - \text{Amount John has}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount John is missing} = 150 - 50 = 100
   \]

Thus, John is missing **$100** to cover his share of the trip cost.

**Final Answer**: John is missing $100.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of money John is missing for the school trip.

Given information:
- The total cost of the school trip is $300.
- The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.
- John has $50.

Step 1: Calculate the amount the school will cover.
Total cost of the trip = $300
School's contribution = 1/2 ร $300 = $150

Step 2: Calculate the amount John needs to contribute.
John's contribution = Total cost of ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money John is missing for his school trip, given that the school will cover half the cost of the trip and John already has $50.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the trip:**  
   The total cost of the trip is given as $300.

2. **Calculate the school's contribution:**  
   The school has decided to cover half of the trip's cost.  
   To find half of the total cost, we calcula...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total cost of trip = $300
* School is covering half the cost
* John currently has $50

2. Calculate how much the school will pay:
* School's portion = $300 รท 2
* School's portion = $150

3. Calculate John's portion:
* John's portion = Total cost - School's portion
* John's portion = $300 - $150
* John's portion = $150

4. Calculate how much more money John needs:
* Mon...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much the school is covering. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, we need to divide the total cost of the trip by 2.

So, $300 รท 2 = $150

This means the school is covering $150 of the trip cost.

Next, we need to determine how much money John still needs after the school's contribution. To do this, we subtract the school's contribution from the total cost of the trip.

So, $300 - $150 = $150

This means that after the sc...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total cost of the trip is $300.
   * The school has decided to cover half the cost of the trip.
   * John has already saved $50.

2. Calculate the amount the school will cover:
   * The school covers half the cost, which means they will pay 50% of the total cost.
   * To calculate the school's contribution, multiply the total cost by 0.5 (which is 50% expressed ...
