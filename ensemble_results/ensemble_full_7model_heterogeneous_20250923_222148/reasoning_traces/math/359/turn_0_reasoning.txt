Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform calculations accordingly.

1. **Determine how much money Billy has initially**: 
   Billy starts with $10.

2. **Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy Billy buys**: 
   The cost of the candy is $1.5 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for \( x \) pounds of candy is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of candy} = 1.5x
   \]

3. **Calculate Billy's change after buying the candy**: 
   After buying the candy, the amount of change Billy has left is:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 10 - 1.5x
   \]

4. **Determine how much Billy spends on gumballs**: 
   Billy takes half of his change to buy gumballs. Therefore, the amount he spends on gumballs is:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on gumballs} = \frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x)
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of the gumballs**: 
   Each gumball costs $0.05, and he buys 40 gumballs. Thus, the total cost for the gumballs is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of gumballs} = 0.05 \times 40 = 2
   \]

6. **Set up the equation**: 
   Since the amount spent on gumballs is equal to half of his change, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x) = 2
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   First, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   10 - 1.5x = 4
   \]
   Next, isolate \( 1.5x \):
   \[
   10 - 4 = 1.5x
   \]
   \[
   6 = 1.5x
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 1.5 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
   \]

8. **Final answer**: 
   Billy bought **4 pounds of candy**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of candy Billy bought.
2. Calculate the amount of change he had after buying the candy.
3. Calculate the amount of money he spent on gumballs.
4. Calculate the number of pounds of candy he bought.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of candy Billy bought.
* Billy had $10 to spend on candy.
* The candy costs $1.5 per pound.
* Total amount of candy bought = $10 / $1.5 p...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of candy Billy bought. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the gumballs:**
   - Billy bought 40 gumballs, and each gumball costs $0.05.
   - The total cost of the gumballs is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how much money Billy had left after buying candy:**
   - Billy spent half of his cha...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's say Billy bought x pounds of candy at $1.5 per pound
   * Cost of candy = $1.5 × x

2) After buying candy, he had change from his $10
   * Change = $10 - $1.5x

3) He spent half of his change on gumballs
   * Half of change = ($10 - $1.5x) ÷ 2

4) We know he bought 40 gumballs at $.05 each
   * Cost of gumballs = 40 × $.05 = $2

5) The cost of gumballs equals half his change
   * $2 = ($10 - $1.5x) ÷ 2

6) ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's figure out how much Billy spent on gumballs. We know that each gumball costs $0.05 and he bought 40 of them. So, the total cost of the gumballs is 40 * $0.05 = $2. 

We also know that Billy spent half of his change on gumballs. This means that the total change he had after buying candy was 2 * $2 = $4. 

Now, let's figure out how much Billy spent on candy. We know that he started with $10 and had $4 left after buying candy. So, he spent $10 - $4 = $6 on candy...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Billy has $10 to spend.
   * Candy costs $1.5 per pound.
   * Gumballs cost $0.05 each.
   * Billy bought 40 gumballs with half of his change from buying candy.

2. Let's find out how much Billy spent on gumballs:
   * Cost of gumballs = Number of gumballs × Price per gumball
   * Cost of gumballs = 40 × $0.05
   * Cost of gumballs = $2

3. Since Billy spent half of...
