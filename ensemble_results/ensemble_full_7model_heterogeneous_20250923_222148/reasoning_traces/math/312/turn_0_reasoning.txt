=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn based on the information given.

1. **Identify Quinn's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Quinn is 30 years old.

2. **Determine Jane's Age**: 
   The problem states that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn. Therefore, we can calculate Jane's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3
   \]
   Substituting Quinn's age:
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = 30 - 3 = 27
   \]

3. **Determine Trent's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. We can calculate Trent's age using Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5
   \]
   Substituting Jane's age:
   \[
   \text{Trent's age} = 27 + 5 = 32
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

In conclusion, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that Trent's age is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Quinn is 30 years old.

Step 1: Find Jane's age.
Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age as:
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27 years old

Step 2: Find Trent's age.
Since Trent is 5 years older than Jane, we can calculate Trent's age as:
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent'...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Trent, Jane, and Quinn based on the relationships described in the problem.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Quinn's age is given as 30 years.
   - Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
   - Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

2. **Determine Jane's age:**
   - Since Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, we can calculate Jane's age by subtracting 3 from Quinn's age.
   \[
   \text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's a...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* Quinn is 30 years old
* Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn
* Trent is 5 years older than Jane

2. First, let's find Jane's age:
* Jane = Quinn - 3
* Jane = 30 - 3
* Jane = 27 years old

3. Now we can find Trent's age:
* Trent = Jane + 5
* Trent = 27 + 5
* Trent = 32 years old

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

To verify:
- Quinn is 30
- Jane is 27 (3 years younger than Quinn)
- T...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out Jane's age. We know that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, and Quinn is 30. So, we subtract 3 from 30 to find Jane's age.

30 - 3 = 27

So, Jane is 27 years old.

Now, we know that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age.

27 + 5 = 32

So, Trent is 32 years old.

Therefore, Trent is 32 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to determine Trent's age.

Given:
- Trent is 5 years older than Jane.
- Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.
- Quinn is 30 years old.

Step 1: Let's express Jane's age in terms of Quinn's age.
Jane's age = Quinn's age - 3
Jane's age = 30 - 3 = 27

Step 2: Now, we can express Trent's age in terms of Jane's age.
Trent's age = Jane's age + 5
Trent's age = 27 + 5 = 32

Therefore, T...
