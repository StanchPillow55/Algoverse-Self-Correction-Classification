=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: We know that there are 50 students in total.

2. **Determine the number of students who like to bake and play basketball**:
   - Number of students who like to bake = 10
   - Number of students who like to play basketball = 5

3. **Calculate the number of students who like to play music**:
   - According to the problem, the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball.
   - Since 5 students like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play music} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students accounted for**:
   - We have:
     - Students who like to bake = 10
     - Students who like to play basketball = 5
     - Students who like to play music = 10
   - Adding these together gives:
     \[
     \text{Total accounted for} = 10 + 5 + 10 = 25
     \]

5. **Determine the number of students who like to play video games**:
   - Since there are 50 students in total and we have accounted for 25 students, the number of students who like to play video games is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students who like to play video games} = 50 - 25 = 25
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of students who like to play video games is \( \boxed{25} \).

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many students like to either play video games or play music. We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. That's a total of 10 + 5 = <<10+5=15>>15 students.

The total number of students in the class is 50, so the number of students who like to either play video games or play music is 50 - 15 = <<50-15=35>>35 students.

The problem tells us that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number that prefer ...
