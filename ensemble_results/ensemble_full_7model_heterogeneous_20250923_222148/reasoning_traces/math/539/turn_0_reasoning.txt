Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: The tip is 20% of the dinner bill. To find the tip amount, we can use the formula for calculating a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Bill} \times \text{Tip Rate}
   \]
   Here, the bill is $50 and the tip rate is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20):
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount that needs to be paid:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Split the total amount**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we divide the total amount by 2:
   \[
   \text{Split Amount} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Determine how much you pay**: You are responsible for paying the entire bill plus the additional tip, which means you will pay the total amount of $60.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Amount Paid} = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The original dinner bill was $50.

2. Your wife wants to evenly split the check, which means you would each pay $25 (half of $50).

3. However, your wife also wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the $50 bill.

To calculate the 20% tip:
* 20% of $50 = 0.20 x $50 = $10

So the total tip amount is $10.

4. Now, to calculate the total amount you end up paying:
* Split of the original $50 bill = $25
* Plu...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how much you end up paying after splitting the dinner bill and adding a 20% tip.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Bill with Tip

First, we need to calculate the total amount of the bill including the tip. The original dinner bill is $50, and you need to add a 20% tip to this amount.

1. **Calculate the Tip Amount:**
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Bill Including Tip:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total dinner bill = $50
* Bill needs to be split evenly between two people
* You need to pay your half plus the entire 20% tip

2. Calculate half of the dinner bill:
* $50 รท 2 = $25
* Your share of the bill = $25

3. Calculate the 20% tip on the full bill:
* 20% = 0.20
* $50 ร 0.20 = $10
* Tip amount = $10

4. Calculate your total payment:
* Your total = Your share of ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's split the $50 dinner bill evenly. Since there are two of you, you would each pay half of the $50 bill. 

$50 / 2 = $25

So, you and your wife would each pay $25 for the dinner bill. 

Next, let's calculate the 20% tip on the $50 bill. 

20% of $50 = 0.20 * $50 = $10

Since your wife wants you to pay the additional 20% tip, you would add this $10 to your half of the dinner bill. 

$25 (your half of the dinner bill) + $10 (the 20% tip) = $35

So, you ended up p...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The total dinner bill is $50.
   * You and your wife want to split the bill evenly.
   * Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on top of your half of the bill.

2. Calculate the amount each person would pay if the bill was split evenly:
   * Even split = Total bill รท 2
   * Even split = $50 รท 2 = $25
   * So, without the additional tip, each person would pay...
