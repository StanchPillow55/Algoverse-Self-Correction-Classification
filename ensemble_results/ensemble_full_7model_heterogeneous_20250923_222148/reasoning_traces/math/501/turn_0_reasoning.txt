Final Answer: To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much yarn Mariah used in yards.**
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate Mariah's usage as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Determine how much yarn her grandma used in yards.**
   - Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - We calculate her grandma's usage as follows:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma.**
   - Now we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = \text{Yards used by Mariah} + \text{Yards used by Grandma}
   \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount of yarn used by Mariah and her grandma together is:
   \[
   \boxed{273} \text{ yards}
   \]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
- Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
- There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah.
Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
Amount of yarn used by Mariah = 1/4 × 364 yards = 91 yards

Step 2: Calculate the amount of yarn used by Mariah's grandma.
Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
Amount of y...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used together. We know that there are 364 yards in a full skein of yarn. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. Let's calculate the amount of yarn each used in yards and then find the total.

**Step 1: Calculate the amount of yarn Mariah used.**

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein. To find out how many yards this is, we multiply the fraction of the skein she used b...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* 1 skein = 364 yards
* Mariah used 1/4 of a skein
* Grandma used 1/2 of a skein

2. Let's find how many yards Mariah used:
* Mariah's yards = 1/4 × 364
* Mariah's yards = 364 ÷ 4
* Mariah's yards = 91 yards

3. Let's find how many yards Grandma used:
* Grandma's yards = 1/2 × 364
* Grandma's yards = 364 ÷ 2
* Grandma's yards = 182 yards

4. To find the total yards used, add Ma...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. To find out how much yarn they used altogether, we need to add these fractions together. 

1/4 + 1/2 = 2/4 + 2/4 = 4/4 = 1

So, they used 1 whole skein of yarn altogether.

Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, they used 364 yards of yarn altogether.

So, the final answer is 364 yards.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used in total.

Given:
- Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn.
- Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.
- There are 364 yards in a skein of yarn.

Step 1: Calculate the number of yards Mariah used.
Mariah's yarn = 1/4 × 364 yards
               = 364 ÷ 4 yards
               = 91 yards

Step 2: Calculate the number of yards Mariah's grand...
