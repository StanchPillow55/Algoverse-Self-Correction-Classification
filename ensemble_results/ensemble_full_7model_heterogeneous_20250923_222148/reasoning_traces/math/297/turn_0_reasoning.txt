=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we will first calculate the total number of crates he sold during the week and then compare that to his target.

1. **Identify the target**: Sam's target for the week is 120 crates.

2. **Days closed**: Sam was closed on Monday and Friday. This means he only sold bread on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

3. **Sales on the weekend**: Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend.

4. **Sales on other days**:
   - Tuesday: 15 crates
   - Wednesday: 12 crates
   - Thursday: 18 crates

5. **Calculate total sales**:
   - Total sales from the weekend: 20 crates
   - Total sales from Tuesday: 15 crates
   - Total sales from Wednesday: 12 crates
   - Total sales from Thursday: 18 crates

   Now, we will add these amounts together to find the total sales for the week:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Weekend sales} + \text{Tuesday sales} + \text{Wednesday sales} + \text{Thursday sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add the weekend and Tuesday sales:
     \[
     20 + 15 = 35
     \]
   - Next, add Wednesday's sales:
     \[
     35 + 12 = 47
     \]
   - Finally, add Thursday's sales:
     \[
     47 + 18 = 65
     \]

   Thus, Sam sold a total of 65 crates during the week.

6. **Determine how many crates he was off from his target**:
   To find out how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the total sales from the target:

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = \text{Target} - \text{Total sales}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = 120 - 65
   \]
   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = 55
   \]

Therefore, Sam was off from his target by **55 crates**.

**Final Answer**: Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify Sam's target and the sales information:
* Weekly target = 120 crates
* Weekend sales = 20 crates
* Tuesday sales = 15 crates
* Wednesday sales = 12 crates
* Thursday sales = 18 crates
* Closed Monday and Friday = 0 crates for those days

2. Let's add up all the sales for the week:
* Weekend: 20 crates

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by adding up all the crates of bread that Sam sold throughout the week.

Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates.
On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates.
On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates.
On Thursday, he sold 18 crates.

So, the total number of crates he sold is 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Sam's target for the week was to sell 120 crates. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target.

So, 120 (...
