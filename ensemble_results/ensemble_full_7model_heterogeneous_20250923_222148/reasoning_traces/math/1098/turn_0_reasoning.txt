=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike based on the information given.

1. **Identify Mike's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Mike is 24 years old.

2. **Determine Martha's Age**: 
   The problem states that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting Mike's age:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine Jeff's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. We can calculate Jeff's age using Martha's age:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10
   \]
   Substituting Martha's age:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   After performing the calculations, we find that Jeff is 30 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha.
- Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.
- Mike is 24 years old.

Step 1: Find Martha's age.
Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate her age as:
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4 = 20 years old

Step 2: Find Jeff's age.
Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we can calculate his a...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike based on the relationships described in the problem.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Mike is 24 years old.
   - Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
   - Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.

2. **Determine Martha's age:**
   - Since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we can calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 from Mike's age.

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Jeff is 10 years older than Martha
- Martha is 4 years younger than Mike
- Mike is 24 years old

Step 1: Find Martha's age
* Mike is 24 years old
* Martha is 4 years younger than Mike
* Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
* Martha's age = 24 - 4 = 20 years old

Step 2: Find Jeff's age
* Jeff is 10 years older than Martha
* Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10
* Jeff's age = 20 + 10 = 30 years old

Therefore...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Mike is 24 years old.

Second, since Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, we subtract 4 from Mike's age to find Martha's age. 

24 - 4 = 20

So, Martha is 20 years old.

Finally, since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, we add 10 to Martha's age to find Jeff's age.

20 + 10 = 30

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is Jeff is 30 years old.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We'll start by clearly stating the important information within the question. Then, we'll use this information to solve for Jeff's age.

Given:
- Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha.
- Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.
- Mike is 24 years old.

Step 1: Let's express Martha's age in terms of Mike's age.
Martha's age = Mike's age - 4
Martha's age = 24 - 4 = 20 years old
