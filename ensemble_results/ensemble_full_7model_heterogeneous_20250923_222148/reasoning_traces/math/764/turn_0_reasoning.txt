=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much Leila, Jack, and Chase spent together to make a salad for the potluck, we need to calculate the total cost for each person and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate Leila's spending on cucumbers:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - The cost of each cucumber is $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for cucumbers is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for cucumbers} = \text{Number of cucumbers} \times \text{Cost per cucumber} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - So, Leila spends **$6** on cucumbers.

2. **Calculate Jack's spending on tomatoes:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - The cost of each tomato is $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost for tomatoes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for tomatoes} = \text{Number of tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per tomato} = 5 \times 1 = 5
     \]
   - So, Jack spends **$5** on tomatoes.

3. **Calculate Chase's spending on lettuce:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - The cost of the lettuce is $3.
   - Therefore, the total cost for lettuce is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for lettuce} = \text{Number of heads of lettuce} \times \text{Cost per head of lettuce} = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]
   - So, Chase spends **$3** on lettuce.

4. **Calculate the total spending of all three:**
   - Now we add up the amounts spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase:
     \[
     \text{Total spending} = \text{Leila's spending} + \text{Jack's spending} + \text{Chase's spending} = 6 + 5 + 3
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     6 + 5 = 11
     \]
     \[
     11 + 3 = 14
     \]

Thus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase together to make a salad for the potluck is **$14**.

Final answer: **$14**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much each person spent on their respective items.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each. To find out how much she spent, we multiply the number of cucumbers by the cost of each cucumber:

3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Next, Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each. We multiply the number of tomatoes by the cost of each tomato:

5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5
