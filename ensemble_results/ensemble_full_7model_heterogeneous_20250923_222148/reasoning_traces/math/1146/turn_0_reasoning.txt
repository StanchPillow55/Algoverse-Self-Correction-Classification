Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100.**
2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the rocks.**
4. **Determine Adam's profit or loss.**

### Step 1: Determine how many rocks Adam can buy

Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5. To find out how many rocks he can buy, we divide his total money by the cost per rock:

\[
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks

Adam only sells 60% of the 20 rocks he bought. First, we calculate how many rocks he sells:

\[
\text{Rocks sold} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock sells for $7:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the rocks

The total cost of the rocks Adam bought is simply the total number of rocks multiplied by the cost per rock:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of rocks} \times \text{Cost per rock} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine Adam's profit or loss

To find out if Adam made a profit or a loss, we subtract the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit or Loss} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 84 - 100 = -16 \text{ dollars}
\]

Since the result is negative, Adam incurs a loss of $16.

### Final Answer

Adam loses **$16**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many rocks Adam can buy with $100
* Cost per rock = $5
* Total money = $100
* Number of rocks = $100 ÷ $5 = 20 rocks

2. Calculate potential revenue if he sells 60% of inventory
* Total inventory = 20 rocks
* Percentage sold = 60%
* Number of rocks sold = 20 × 0.60 = 12 rocks
* Revenue per rock = $7
* Total revenue = 12 rocks × $7 = $84

3. Calculate loss
* Initial investment = $100
* Revenu...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. 

Since each rock costs $5, we divide his total money by the cost per rock:

$100 ÷ $5/rock = 20 rocks

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks with his $100.

Next, let's determine how many rocks Adam sells. 

Since he sells 60% of his inventory, we multiply the total number of rocks he bought by 60%:

20 rocks * 60% = 12 rocks

So, Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate how much money Adam makes from selling these ...

1. Understand the given information:
   * Adam has $100 to invest in his rock stand.
   * He can buy rocks for $5 each.
   * He can sell rocks for $7 each.
   * He will only sell 60% of his inventory.

2. Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy with his $100:
   * Number of rocks = Total money / Cost per rock
