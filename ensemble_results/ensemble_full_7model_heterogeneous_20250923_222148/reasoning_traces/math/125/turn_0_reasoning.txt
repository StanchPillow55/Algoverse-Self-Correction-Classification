=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought.
   - Julia's husband bought a package of 5 spoons.

2. **Calculate the total number of spoons before Julia used any:**
   - The total number of spoons Julia had before using any is the sum of the spoons she bought and the spoons her husband bought:
   \[
   \text{Total spoons before using any} = x + 5
   \]

3. **Determine how many spoons Julia used:**
   - Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.

4. **Calculate the total number of spoons after Julia used some:**
   - After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons left is:
   \[
   \text{Total spoons after using 3} = (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2
   \]

5. **Set up the equation based on the information given:**
   - We know that after using the spoons, Julia had a total of 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x + 2 = 12
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 12 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Thus, the final answer is that Julia bought **10 spoons** in the package.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
- Julia bought a package of spoons (unknown amount)
- Her husband bought 5 spoons
- Julia used 3 spoons for sampling
- At the end, she had 12 spoons total

Let's solve:
1. Let's say Julia's package had 'x' spoons
2. Total spoons = Julia's package + Husband's package - Used spoons
3. We can write this as an equation:
   * x + 5 - 3 = 12
   * where x = Julia's package
   * 5 = husband's package
   *...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as x.

According to the problem, Julia's husband bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. Then, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. Finally, she had 12 spoons left.

We can express this situation with the following equation:

x (the number of spoons Julia bought) + 5 (the spoons her husband bought) - 3 (the spoons Julia used) = 12 (the total number of spoons left)

Solving this equation will give us the...
