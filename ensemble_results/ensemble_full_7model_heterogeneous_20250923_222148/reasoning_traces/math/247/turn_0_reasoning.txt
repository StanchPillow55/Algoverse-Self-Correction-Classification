=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the items that Isabelle bought. We will then divide that total by the number of people sharing the cost, which is three (Isabelle and her two parents).

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the party supplies.**

We will add up the costs of each item:

- Cost of ingredients for the cake: $12
- Cost of birthday presents: $43
- Cost of decorations: $15
- Cost of invitations: $4
- Cost of goodie bags: $22

Now, we sum these amounts:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \(12 + 43 = 55\)
2. \(55 + 15 = 70\)
3. \(70 + 4 = 74\)
4. \(74 + 22 = 96\)

So, the total cost of the party supplies is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 96 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Divide the total cost by the number of people sharing the cost.**

Isabelle is sharing the total cost with her two parents, which means there are three people in total.

Now, we divide the total cost by 3:

\[
\text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{3} = \frac{96}{3}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{96}{3} = 32
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each person paid **$32**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Isabelle's total expenses for the party supplies:
   * Cake ingredients: $12
   * Birthday presents: $43
   * Decorations: $15
   * Invitations: $4
   * Goodie bags: $22
   * Total expenses: $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

2. Isabelle split the cost evenly three ways with her two parents, so each person's share would be:
   * Total expenses: $96
   * Number of people splitting the cost: 3
   * Each perso...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total cost of the party supplies and then divide that total by three, since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the party supplies.**

Isabelle spent money on the following items:
- Ingredients for the cake: $12
- Birthday presents: $43
- Decorations: $15
- Invitations: $4
- Goodie bags: $22

To find the total cost, we add up all these expenses:
...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, I'll find the total cost by adding up all the expenses:
* Cake ingredients: $12
* Birthday presents: $43
* Decorations: $15
* Invitations: $4
* Goodie bags: $22

$12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96 total cost

2. Since Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parents, the total amount needs to be divided by 3 people:
* $96 รท 3 = $32

Therefore, each person (Isabelle and each parent) paid $32.

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the individual costs:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Next, we need to find out how much each person paid. Since the cost was split evenly three ways, we divide the total cost by 3:

$96 รท 3 = $32

So, each person paid $32 for the party supplies.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's add up all the expenses for the party supplies:
   * Cake ingredients: $12
   * Birthday presents: $43
   * Decorations: $15
   * Invitations: $4
   * Goodie bags: $22

   To calculate the total cost, we add all these amounts together:
   $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22 = $96

   So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

2. Now, we know that Isabelle split the cost evenly with her two parent...
