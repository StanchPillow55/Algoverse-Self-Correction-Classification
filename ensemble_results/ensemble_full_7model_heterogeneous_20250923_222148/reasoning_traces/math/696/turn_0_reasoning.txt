=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points collected by each student and then determine how many points the class is missing to reach the threshold of 400 points.

1. **Calculate Betty's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - To find Betty's points, we calculate 30% of Adam's points:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
     \]
   - Now, we add this to Adam's points to find Betty's total:
     \[
     \text{Betty's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
     \]

2. **Calculate Tom's Points:**
   - We know that Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tom's points} = \text{Betty's points} - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
     \]

3. **Calculate Marta's Points:**
   - Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Thus, Marta's points are:
     \[
     \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times \text{Tom's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Points Collected by the Class:**
   - Now we sum the points collected by all four students:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
     \]

5. **Determine How Many Points the Class is Missing:**
   - The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.
   - To find out how many points the class is missing, we subtract the total points collected from the threshold:
     \[
     \text{Points missing} = 400 - \text{Total points} = 400 - 255 = 145
     \]

Thus, the class is missing **145 points** to reach the threshold for the trip.

**Final Answer: 145 points**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it.

Given information:
- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
- The minimum threshold for the class to go on the trip is 400 points.

Step 1: Calculate the number of points collected by Betty.
Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points
Betty's points = 50 + (0...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of points collected by the students in class 3B and determine how many more points are needed to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Adam's Points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.

2. **Betty's Points:**
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - To find 30% of Adam's points: \( 0.30 \times 50 = 15 \).
   - Therefore, Betty's total points: ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify Adam's points:
* Adam = 50 points

2. Calculate Betty's points (30% more than Adam):
* 30% of 50 = 50 × 0.30 = 15
* Betty = Adam + 15 = 50 + 15 = 65 points

3. Calculate Tom's points (30 less than Betty):
* Tom = Betty - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35 points

4. Calculate Martha's points (3 times more than Tom):
* Martha = Tom × 3 = 35 × 3 = 105 points

5. Calculate total class points:
* Total = Adam + B...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how many points Betty has collected. Since Betty was better than Adam and collected 30% more points, we can calculate her points as follows:

Betty's points = Adam's points + 30% of Adam's points
= 50 + 0.30 * 50
= 50 + 15
= 65 points

Next, let's find out how many points Tom has. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, we can calculate his points as follows:

Tom's points = Betty's points - 30
= 65 - 30
= 35 points

Now, let's find out how many poi...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. We need to find out how many points each student has collected and then calculate the total points to see how many points the class is missing to reach the 400-point threshold.

Given:
- Adam has collected 50 points.
- Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
- Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
- Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
