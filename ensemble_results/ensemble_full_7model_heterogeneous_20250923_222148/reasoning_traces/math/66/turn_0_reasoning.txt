=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of people sent by the four schools to the basketball tournament. We will break down the components step by step.

1. **Identify the components for each school**:
   - Each school has:
     - A girls' basketball team with 5 players.
     - A boys' basketball team with 5 players.
     - A coach for the girls' team.
     - A coach for the boys' team.

2. **Calculate the total number of people from one school**:
   - Number of players in the girls' team: 5
   - Number of players in the boys' team: 5
   - Number of coaches: 2 (one for each team)

   Now, we can add these together for one school:
   \[
   \text{Total for one school} = \text{players in girls' team} + \text{players in boys' team} + \text{coaches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total for one school} = 5 + 5 + 2 = 12
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of people for all four schools**:
   - Since there are 4 schools, we multiply the total number of people from one school by the number of schools:
   \[
   \text{Total for all schools} = \text{Total for one school} \times \text{number of schools}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total for all schools} = 12 \times 4 = 48
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total number of people sent by all of the schools to the basketball tournament is \( \boxed{48} \).

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we need to count:
   * Players on each team
   * Number of teams per school
   * Coaches per school
   * Total number of schools

2. Let's count players:
   * Each team has 5 players
   * Each school has 2 teams (boys and girls)
   * So each school has: 5 players × 2 teams = 10 players

3. Let's count coaches:

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Each school has sent a girls' basketball team, a boys' basketball team, and a coach for each team. 

Each basketball team has 5 players, so each school has sent 5 girls + 5 boys = 10 players. 

Each school has also sent a coach for each team, so each school has sent 1 girls' coach + 1 boys' coach = 2 coaches. 

So, each school has sent a total of 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people. 

There are 4 schools competing, so in total, the schools have sent 4 schools * 12 people/s...
