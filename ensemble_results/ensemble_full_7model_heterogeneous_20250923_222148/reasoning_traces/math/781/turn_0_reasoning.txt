Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the two remaining pizzas given that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars and that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the two remaining pizzas

First, we know the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. We also know that the cost of two of the pizzas is 30 dollars. Therefore, we can find the cost of the remaining two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the two pizzas from the total cost.

\[
\text{Cost of remaining two pizzas} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of two pizzas}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Cost of remaining two pizzas} = 64 - 30 = 34 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the cost of each of the remaining pizzas

Since the problem states that the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we can denote the cost of each of these pizzas as \( x \). Therefore, the equation for the cost of the two remaining pizzas can be expressed as:

\[
2x = 34
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = \frac{34}{2} = 17
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is 17 dollars.

\[
\text{Final answer: Each of the other two pizzas costs } 17 \text{ dollars.}

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 4 friends ordered 4 pizzas for a total of $64
- 2 of the pizzas cost $30 each

To find the cost of the other 2 pizzas, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the 2 pizzas that cost $30 each
2. Subtract that total from the overall $64 to get the cost of the other 2 pizzas
3. Divide the remaining cost by 2 to get the cost of each of the other 2 pizzas

Step 1: Calculate the total cost o...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each of the other two pizzas, given that four pizzas in total cost 64 dollars and two of them together cost 30 dollars.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Total Cost and Known Costs:**
   - Total cost of all four pizzas = 64 dollars.
   - Cost of two pizzas = 30 dollars.

2. **Determine the Cost of the Remaining Two Pizzas:**
   - Since the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars and ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
* Total cost of 4 pizzas = $64
* 2 pizzas cost $30 total
* The other 2 pizzas cost the same amount as each other

Step 1: Find how much money is left for the other 2 pizzas
* Total money remaining = Total cost - Cost of first 2 pizzas
* Total money remaining = $64 - $30 = $34

Step 2: Find the cost of each of the remaining pizzas
* Since the remaining 2 pizzas cost the same amount:
* Cost per pizz...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The total cost of the four pizzas is $64. We know that two of the pizzas cost $30 in total. 

To find out how much the other two pizzas cost, we subtract the cost of the first two pizzas from the total cost. 

So, $64 (total cost) - $30 (cost of first two pizzas) = $34.

This $34 is the total cost of the other two pizzas. Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide this total cost by 2 to find the cost of each pizza.

So, $34 รท 2 = $17.

Therefore, each of the ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are four pizzas in total.
   * The total cost of all four pizzas is $64.
   * Two of the pizzas cost $30 together.
   * The other two pizzas cost the same amount each.

2. Calculate the cost of the remaining two pizzas:
   * Total cost of all pizzas = $64
   * Cost of two known pizzas = $30
   * Cost of the other two pizzas = Total cost - Cost of two known ...
