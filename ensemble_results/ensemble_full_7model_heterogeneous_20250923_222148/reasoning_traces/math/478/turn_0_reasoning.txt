=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total number of people going on the tour, we need to calculate the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

1. **Calculate the total number of employees:**
   - The company has divided its employees into 3 groups.
   - Each group consists of 200 employees.
   - Therefore, the total number of employees can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Employees} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Employees per Group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Employees} = 3 \times 200 = 600
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of tour guides:**
   - Each group is assigned 7 tour guides.
   - Since there are 3 groups, the total number of tour guides can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Tour Guides} = \text{Number of Groups} \times \text{Tour Guides per Group}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tour Guides} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of people going on the tour:**
   - The total number of people going on the tour includes both the employees and the tour guides. Therefore, we add the total number of employees to the total number of tour guides:

   \[
   \text{Total People} = \text{Total Employees} + \text{Total Tour Guides}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total People} = 600 + 21 = 621
   \]

Thus, the total number of people going on the tour is **621**.
