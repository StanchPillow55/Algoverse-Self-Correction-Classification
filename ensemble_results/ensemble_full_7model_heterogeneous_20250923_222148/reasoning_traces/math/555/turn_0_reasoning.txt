=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many weeks it will take John to save $80, we first need to calculate how much money he earns in a week.

1. **Calculate John's daily earnings:**
   - John earns $2 per hour.
   - He works 5 hours a day.
   - Therefore, his daily earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked per Day} = 2 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's weekly earnings:**
   - John works 4 days a week.
   - His weekly earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days Worked per Week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 40 \, \text{dollars/week}
     \]

3. **Determine how many weeks it will take to save $80:**
   - We need to find out how many weeks it will take for John to save $80 given his weekly earnings.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Number of Weeks} = \frac{\text{Total Savings Goal}}{\text{Weekly Earnings}} = \frac{80 \, \text{dollars}}{40 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 2 \, \text{weeks}
     \]

Thus, it will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much John makes per day:
* $2 per hour × 5 hours per day = $10 per day

2. Next, let's calculate how much John makes per week:
* $10 per day × 4 days per week = $40 per week

3. Now, to find how many weeks it will take to save $80:
* We divide the target amount by the weekly earnings
* $80 ÷ $40 = 2 weeks

Reasoning:
* Since John earns $40 per week and needs $80 total
* He will need to ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money John makes in a day. He works 5 hours a day and gets paid $2 per hour, so he makes 5 * $2 = $<<5*2=10>>10 per day.

Next, we need to calculate how much money he makes in a week. He works 4 days a week, so he makes 4 * $10 = $<<4*10=40>>40 per week.

Now, we need to calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80. If he saves all his earnings, it will take him $80 / $40 = <<80/40=2>>2 weeks.

So, it will take John 2 weeks to...
