=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many water balloons Jolene and her friends threw during the water balloon fight.

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons filled:**
   - Jolene filled 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons.
   - To find the total number of balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack} = 10 \times 30 = 300
     \]

2. **Determine how many balloons were thrown:**
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left. To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons filled:
     \[
     \text{Balloons thrown} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Balloons left} = 300 - 12 = 288
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of balloons that Jolene and her friends threw is:
     \[
     \boxed{288}
     \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons
- Each pack has 30 balloons
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left

To find the total number of balloons thrown, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of balloons filled
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons filled
Total balloons filled = Number of packs × B...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many balloons were thrown during the water balloon fight. We can do this by following these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons initially available.**

   Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons. To find the total number of balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:

   \[
   \text{Total balloons} = 10 \text{ packs} \time...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of balloons they started with:
   * Number of packs = 10
   * Balloons per pack = 30
   * Total balloons = 10 × 30 = 300 balloons

2. We know that 12 balloons were left at the end
   * Starting balloons = 300
   * Remaining balloons = 12

3. To find how many balloons were thrown:
   * Balloons thrown = Starting balloons - Remaining balloons
   * Balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends filled up in total. We do this by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack. 

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

Next, we subtract the number of balloons left at the end of the afternoon from the total number of balloons filled up to find out how many were thrown.

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step. To find out how many balloons they threw, we need to calculate the total number of balloons they started with and then subtract the number of balloons left at the end.

Given:
- They filled up 10 packs of balloons.
- Each pack contains 30 balloons.
- 12 balloons were left at the end of the afternoon.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons they started with.
Total balloons = Number of packs × Balloon...
