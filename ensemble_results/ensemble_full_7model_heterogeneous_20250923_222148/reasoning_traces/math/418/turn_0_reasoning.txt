=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the lockers based on the information given.

1. **Identify the size of Peter's locker**:
   We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

2. **Relate Peter's locker to Zack's locker**:
   The problem states that Peter's locker is \( \frac{1}{4} \) as big as Zack's locker. We can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{4} Z
   \]
   where \( P \) is the size of Peter's locker and \( Z \) is the size of Zack's locker. Since we know \( P = 5 \) cubic inches, we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   5 = \frac{1}{4} Z
   \]

3. **Solve for Zack's locker size**:
   To find \( Z \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   Z = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]
   So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

4. **Relate Zack's locker to Timothy's locker**:
   The problem states that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. We can express this relationship as:
   \[
   Z = \frac{1}{2} T
   \]
   where \( T \) is the size of Timothy's locker. We already found that \( Z = 20 \) cubic inches, so we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   20 = \frac{1}{2} T
   \]

5. **Solve for Timothy's locker size**:
   To find \( T \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   T = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the size of Timothy's locker is \( \boxed{40} \) cubic inches.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.
- Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

Step 1: Find the size of Zack's locker.
Since Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, we can use this relationship to find the size of Zack's locker.
Peter's locker = 1/4 × Zack's locker
5 cubic inches = 1/4 × Zack's locker
Zack's locker = 5 cubic ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of Timothy's locker given the relationships between the sizes of the lockers of Zack, Peter, and Timothy.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches.
- Let \( Z \) be the size of Zack's locker in cubic inches.
- Let \( P \) be the size of Peter's locker in cubic inches.

We are given the following relationships:
1. Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker: 
   \[
...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker
* Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker
* Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches

2. Let's find Zack's locker size first:
* If Peter's locker is 1/4 of Zack's locker
* Then Zack's locker must be 4 times bigger than Peter's
* Zack's locker = 5 × 4 = 20 cubic inches

3. Now let's find Timothy's locker size:
* If Zack's locker is hal...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by figuring out the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying 5 by 4. 

5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Now, let's find the size of Timothy's locker. Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying the size of Zack's locker by...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We'll use the given information to find the size of Timothy's locker.

Given:
- Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.
- Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.
- Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.

Step 1: Let's express the size of Zack's locker in terms of Timothy's locker.
Zack's locker = 1/2 × Timothy's locker

Step 2: Express the size of Peter's locker in terms of Zack's locker.
