=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen based on the information provided about the costs of a pencil and an eraser.

1. **Identify the costs of the pencil and eraser:**
   - The cost of a pencil is given as \( P = 1.20 \) dollars.
   - The cost of an eraser is given as \( E = 0.30 \) dollars.

2. **Calculate the combined cost of the pencil and eraser:**
   To find the total cost of the pencil and eraser together, we add their costs:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of pencil and eraser} = P + E = 1.20 + 0.30
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
   \]
   Therefore, the combined cost of the pencil and eraser is \( 1.50 \) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of one pen:**
   According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the combined cost of the pencil and eraser. Thus, the cost of one pen \( \text{Pen} \) is:
   \[
   \text{Pen} = 1.50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of 8 pens:**
   To find the total cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Pen} = 8 \times 1.50
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The total cost for 8 pens is \( 12.00 \) dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.
- We need to find the cost of 8 pens.

Step 1: Find the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined.
Cost of a pencil = $1.20
Cost of an eraser = $0.30
Cost of a pencil and an eraser combined = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Step 2: Find the cost of a pen.
Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen and then calculate the total cost for 8 pens.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of one pen

According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the combined cost of one pencil and one eraser.

- The cost of one pencil is given as $1.20.
- The cost of one eraser is given as $0.30.

To find the cost of one pen, we add the cost of one pencil and one eraser:

\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of one pen...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the cost of one pen
   * A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined
   * Pencil cost = $1.20
   * Eraser cost = $0.30
   * Cost of one pen = Pencil cost + Eraser cost
   * Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

2. Now, to find the cost of 8 pens
   * Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
   * Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 × 8 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

Final Answer: $12.00

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The cost of a pen is equal to the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. 

To find the cost of a pen, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser together. 

$1.20 (pencil) + $0.30 (eraser) = $1.50 (pen)

Now that we know a pen costs $1.50, we can find out how much 8 pens will cost. 

To do this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8. 

$1.50 (pen) x 8 = $12.00

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00.

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A pencil costs $1.20
   * An eraser costs $0.30
   * A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined

2. Calculate the cost of one pen:
   * Cost of one pen = Cost of one pencil + Cost of one eraser
   * Cost of one pen = $1.20 + $0.30
   * Cost of one pen = $1.50

3. Calculate the cost of 8 pens:
   * Cost of 8 pens = Cost of one pen × 8
   * Cost of 8 pens = $1.5...
