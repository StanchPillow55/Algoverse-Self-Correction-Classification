=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day over the next 4 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.**
   - Science: 4 pages
   - Social Studies: 20 pages
   - History: 7 pages
   - Geography: 8 pages

   We add these numbers together:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:

   \[
   4 + 20 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 + 7 = 31
   \]
   \[
   31 + 8 = 39
   \]

   So, the total number of pages Solo needs to read is **39 pages**.

2. **Determine how many pages Solo has already read.**
   - Solo read 15 pages on Monday.

3. **Calculate the remaining pages Solo needs to read.**
   We subtract the pages already read from the total pages:

   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = 39 - 15
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   39 - 15 = 24
   \]

   So, Solo has **24 pages** left to read.

4. **Calculate the average number of pages Solo needs to read per day over the next 4 days.**
   To find the average, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days left:

   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\text{Remaining pages}}{\text{Days left}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average pages per day} = \frac{24}{4}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

   Therefore, Solo needs to read an average of **6 pages per day** over the next 4 days.

**Final Answer: 6 pages per day.**

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of pages Solo has to read and then calculate how many pages he needs to read per day over the next 4 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.**

Solo needs to read the following pages from each textbook:
- Science: 4 pages
- Social Studies: 20 pages
- History: 7 pages
- Geography: 8 pages

To find the total number of pages, we add these together:

\[
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pa...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of pages Solo needs to read:
   * Science: 4 pages
   * Social Studies: 20 pages
   * History: 7 pages
   * Geography: 8 pages
   * Total = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

2. Solo already read 15 pages on Monday
   * Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
   * Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages

3. Solo has 4 more days to read the remaining pages
   * To find the aver...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out the total number of pages Solo needs to read. 

He needs to read 4 pages from his Science textbook, 20 pages from his Social Studies textbook, 7 pages from his History textbook, and 8 pages from his Geography textbook. 

So, the total number of pages is 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages.

On Monday, Solo read 15 pages. So, the remaining number of pages he needs to read is 39 - 15 = 24 pages.

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. So, to find out ...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. First, let's find the total number of pages Solo has to read:
   * Science textbook: 4 pages
   * Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
   * History textbook: 7 pages
   * Geography textbook: 8 pages
   * Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

2. Now, we know that Solo read 15 pages on Monday. So, let's subtract that from the total pages:
   * Remaining pages = Total pages - Pages read on Monday
   * Remainin...
