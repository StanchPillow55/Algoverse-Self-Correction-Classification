Final Answer: To determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total spent by the baseball coach.**

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at a price of $3 each. We can calculate the total cost for the baseballs using the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of items} \times \text{Price per item}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost for baseballs} = 9 \times 3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
9 \times 3 = 27
\]

So, the baseball coach spent **$27**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total spent by the basketball coach.**

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at a price of $14 each. We use the same formula to calculate the total cost for the basketballs:

\[
\text{Total cost for basketballs} = 8 \times 14
\]

Calculating this:

\[
8 \times 14 = 112
\]

So, the basketball coach spent **$112**.

**Step 3: Determine how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach.**

Now we need to find the difference between the amount spent by the basketball coach and the amount spent by the baseball coach:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total spent by basketball coach} - \text{Total spent by baseball coach}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 27
\]

Calculating this:

\[
112 - 27 = 85
\]

Thus, the basketball coach spent **$85** more than the baseball coach.

**Final Answer:**
The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to calculate how much each coach spent on their respective sports equipment.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at $3 each. To find out how much he spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost of each baseball:

9 baseballs * $3/baseball = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at $14 each. To find out how much he spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost of each basketball:

8 basketballs * $14/basketball = $112
