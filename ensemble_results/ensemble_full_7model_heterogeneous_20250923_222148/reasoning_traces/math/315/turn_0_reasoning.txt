Final Answer: To determine how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of invited guests.**
   - Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ people}
     \]
   - She also invited 3 families with 4 people each:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ people}
     \]
   - Now, we add the two groups together to find the total number of invited guests:
     \[
     12 + 12 = 24 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine how many people couldn't come.**
   - It is given that 8 people couldn't come due to illness.

3. **Calculate how many people had previous commitments.**
   - We are told that 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come had previous commitments. Since 8 people couldn't come:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of people who couldn't attend the party.**
   - We add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those who had previous commitments:
     \[
     8 + 2 = 10 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Determine how many people will show up at the party.**
   - We subtract the total number of people who couldn't attend from the total number of invited guests:
     \[
     24 - 10 = 14 \text{ people}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **14 people show up for Martha's party.**

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each, and 3 families with 4 people each.
   * 2 families with 6 people each = 2 x 6 = 12 people
   * 3 families with 4 people each = 3 x 4 = 12 people
   * Total people invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
   * 24 people - 8 people = 16 people

3. 1/4 of the 8 people who couldn't come had previous commitments.
   * 1/4 of 8 = 2 peo...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To determine how many people show up for Martha's party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people invited:**

   - Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each. Therefore, the total number of people from these families is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ people}
     \]

   - She also invited 3 families with 4 people each. Therefore, the total number of people from these families is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ people}

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how many people were initially invited:
* 2 families × 6 people = 12 people
* 3 families × 4 people = 12 people
* Total invited = 12 + 12 = 24 people

2. Now let's subtract those who couldn't come:
* 8 people couldn't come due to illness
* For previous commitments:
  * 1/4 of 8 = 2 people had previous commitments

3. Total number who couldn't attend:
* 8 (illness) + 2 (commitments) = 10 peo...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. 

So, the total number of people from the 2 families is 2 * 6 = <<2*6=12>>12 people.
And the total number of people from the 3 families is 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 people.

Adding these two amounts together, Martha invited 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 people in total.

Next, let's calculate how many people couldn't come. We know that 8 peo...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Martha invited 2 families with 6 people each
   * She also invited 3 families with 4 people each
   * 8 people couldn't come due to illness
   * 1/4 of the number of people who couldn't come due to illness had previous commitments
