=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine the cost per individual razor after discounts, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without any discounts.**
   - Each pack costs $4.00.
   - Therefore, the cost for 2 packs is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/pack} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Apply the buy one get one free offer.**
   - Since Heather is buying 2 packs, she will only pay for 1 pack due to the buy one get one free offer.
   - Thus, the cost after applying the offer is:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} \text{ (cost of 1 pack)}
     \]

3. **Apply the $2.00 coupon.**
   - The cost after applying the coupon is:
     \[
     4.00 \text{ dollars} - 2.00 \text{ dollars} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the total number of razors purchased.**
   - Each pack contains 4 razors, and since Heather buys 2 packs, the total number of razors is:
     \[
     2 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ razors/pack} = 8 \text{ razors}
     \]

5. **Calculate the cost per individual razor.**
   - The total cost after discounts is $2.00 for 8 razors. To find the cost per razor, we divide the total cost by the number of razors:
     \[
     \text{Cost per razor} = \frac{2.00 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ razors}} = 0.25 \text{ dollars/razor}
     \]

6. **Convert the cost per razor to cents.**
   - Since 1 dollar equals 100 cents, we convert $0.25 to cents:
     \[
     0.25 \text{ dollars} \times 100 \text{ cents/dollar} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that each individual razor costs **25 cents** after the discount.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Heather will pay for the razors and then calculate the cost per individual razor.

1. **Understand the offer:**
   - The razors come in packs of 4, and each pack costs $4.00.
   - The current sale is "buy one get one free," meaning if Heather buys one pack, she gets another pack for free.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Regular price calculation:
* 2 packs at $4.00 each = $4.00 × 2 = $8.00

2. Buy one get one free discount:
* Only pay for 1 pack = $4.00
* Second pack is free

3. Apply $2.00 coupon:
* $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00 final cost

4. Calculate number of razors:
* Each pack has 4 razors
* 2 packs = 4 × 2 = 8 total razors

5. Calculate cost per razor:
* $2.00 ÷ 8 razors = $0.25 per razor
* Convert to cents: $0.25 × 100 = 25 cen...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's find out how much Heather will pay for the razors before applying the coupon. Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, she will only pay for one pack of razors when she buys two. This means she will pay $4.00 for 2 packs of razors.

Next, let's apply the $2.00 coupon. This will reduce the price of the razors to $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's find out how many razors Heather is getting. Since each pack contains 4 razors, and she is buying 2 p...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Razors come in packs of 4.
   * Each pack costs $4.00.
   * There's a buy one get one free sale.
   * Heather has a $2.00 coupon.
   * She plans to buy 2 packs of razors.

2. Calculate the cost of 2 packs of razors without the sale:
   * Cost of 2 packs = $4.00 × 2
   * Cost of 2 packs = $8.00

3. Apply the buy one get one free sale:
   * With the sale, Heather only pa...
