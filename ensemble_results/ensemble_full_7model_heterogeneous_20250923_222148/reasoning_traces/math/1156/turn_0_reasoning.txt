=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much profit Linus earned after selling all the mobile devices he bought, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of the devices Linus bought.**
2. **Calculate the selling price of each device.**
3. **Calculate the total selling price for all devices.**
4. **Calculate the total profit.**

### Step 1: Determine the Cost of the Devices

Linus buys a mobile device for $20. 

- On Monday, he bought 2 devices:
  \[
  \text{Cost on Monday} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices:
  \[
  \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Total Cost**:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost on Monday} + \text{Cost on Tuesday} = 40 + 80 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Selling Price of Each Device

Linus sells each device for twice the amount of the original price:
\[
\text{Selling Price per Device} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Selling Price for All Devices

Now, we need to find out how many devices Linus sold in total:
- Total devices bought = 2 (Monday) + 4 (Tuesday) = 6 devices.

Now, we calculate the total selling price:
\[
\text{Total Selling Price} = \text{Number of Devices} \times \text{Selling Price per Device} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Profit

Profit is calculated as the total selling price minus the total cost:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost} = 240 - 120 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Linus earned a profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
- Linus sells the mobile device for twice the amount of the original price.
- Linus bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate the selling price of each mobile device.
Selling price = 2 × Original price
Selling price = 2 × $20 = $40

Step 2: Calculate the profit per mobile device.
Profit per device = Selling pric...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the profit Linus makes from buying and selling the mobile devices. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the selling price of one device:**
   - Linus buys each mobile device for $20.
   - He sells each device for twice the original price.
   - Therefore, the selling price of one device is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the profit per device:**
   - The profit from se...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the important information:
* Buying price per device = $20
* Selling price = 2 × buying price = 2 × $20 = $40 per device
* Number of devices bought on Monday = 2
* Number of devices bought on Tuesday = 4
* Total devices = 2 + 4 = 6 devices

2. Let's calculate the profit per device:
* Profit per device = Selling price - Buying price
* Profit per device = $40 - $20 = $20 per device

3. Calcula...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's determine how much Linus sells each mobile device for. Since he sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, and the original price is $20, he sells each device for 2 * $20 = $40.

Next, let's calculate how many devices Linus bought in total last Monday and Tuesday. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so he bought a total of 2 + 4 = <<2+4=6>>6 devices.

Since he sells each device for $40, the total amount he received f...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Linus buys a mobile device for $20.
   * He sells each device for twice the original price.
   * Last Monday, he bought 2 devices.
   * Last Tuesday, he bought 4 devices.

2. Calculate the selling price of each device:
   * Original price = $20
   * Selling price = 2 × Original price
   * Selling price = 2 × $20 = $40

3. Calculate the total cost of devices bough...
