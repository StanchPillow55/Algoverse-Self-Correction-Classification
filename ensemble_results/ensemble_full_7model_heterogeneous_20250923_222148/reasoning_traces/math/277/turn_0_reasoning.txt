Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the time to dig small holes:**
   - Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - Therefore, for 30 small holes, the total time can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for small holes} = \text{Number of small holes} \times \text{Time per small hole}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for small holes} = 30 \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time to dig large holes:**
   - Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig one large hole.
   - Therefore, for 15 large holes, the total time can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for large holes} = \text{Number of large holes} \times \text{Time per large hole}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for large holes} = 15 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time:**
   - Now, we add the time taken for small holes and large holes:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time for small holes} + \text{Time for large holes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert total time from minutes to hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time into hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in minutes}}{60}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes is **4 hours**.

Final answer: **4 hours**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs.
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.
- Matthew needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

Step 1: Calculate the total time it takes to dig the 30 small holes.
Time to dig 1 small hole = 3 minutes
Time to dig 30 small holes = 30 × 3 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes to dig...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, and then convert that time from minutes to hours.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the time for small holes:**
   - Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig one small hole.
   - For 30 small holes, the total time is:
     \[
     30 \text{ holes} \times 3 \text{ minutes/hole} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time for large holes:**
   - M...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total time for small holes:
* Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
* Number of small holes = 30
* Total time for small holes = 3 × 30 = 90 minutes

2. Next, let's find the total time for large holes:
* Time for one large hole = 10 minutes
* Number of large holes = 15
* Total time for large holes = 10 × 15 = 150 minutes

3. Calculate total time in minutes:
* Total minutes = Time for small hole...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the small holes. 

Since it takes him 3 minutes to dig a small hole, to dig 30 small holes, he will need 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the large holes. 

Since it takes him 10 minutes to dig a large hole, to dig 15 large holes, he will need 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

Adding these two times together, Matthew will need 90 minu...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Matthew takes 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs.
   * Matthew takes 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.
   * We need to find the total time it takes Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

2. Calculate the time it takes to dig the small holes:
   * Time for one small hole = 3 minutes
   * Number of small holes = 30
   * Time for 30 small holes =...
