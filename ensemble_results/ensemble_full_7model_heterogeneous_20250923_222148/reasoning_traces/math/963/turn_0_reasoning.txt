=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Alex.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.
- Let \( D \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now we have three equations:
1. \( A + S + D = 339 \)
2. \( A = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4D - 13 \)

### Step 1: Substitute \( A \) in terms of \( S \) into the first equation

Substituting equation 2 into equation 1:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 4)}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( S \) in terms of \( D \) into Equation 4

Now we substitute equation 3 into equation 4:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

### Step 3: Find \( S \) using \( D \)

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \) using equation 3:
\[
S = 4D - 13
\]
Substituting \( D = 40 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
S = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

### Step 4: Find \( A \) using \( S \)

Now we can find \( A \) using equation 2:
\[
A = S + 5
\]
Substituting \( S = 147 \):
\[
A = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

### Step 5: Verify the total

Finally, we can verify that the total number of Pokémon caught is correct:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This matches the total given in the problem.

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Total Pokemon caught = 339
- Alex has 5 more than Stan
- Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's amount

Let's solve:
1. Let's use variables:
   * Let A = Alex's Pokemon
   * Let S = Stan's Pokemon
   * Let W = Adelwolfe's Pokemon

2. We can write equations:
   * A + S + W = 339 (total)
   * A = S + 5 (Alex has 5 more than Stan)
   * S = 4W - 13 (Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe's)

3. Substitute A...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and Ad respectively.

From the problem, we know that:

A + S + Ad = 339 (equation 1)

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, which can be written as:

A = S + 5 (equation 2)

And Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, which can be written as:

S = 4Ad - 13 (equation 3)

Now we can substitute equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + (4Ad - 13) + ...

Given:
- Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe have caught a total of 339 Pokemon.
- Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan.
- Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.
