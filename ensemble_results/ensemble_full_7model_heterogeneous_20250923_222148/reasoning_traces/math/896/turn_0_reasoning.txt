=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate his total income from renting the car and then subtract his car payment from that income.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Income from Renting the Car

John rents his car out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time. The payment he receives is $25 per hour.

1. **Calculate the total hours rented per month:**
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Number of rentals} \times \text{Hours per rental}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = 10 \text{ rentals} \times 3 \text{ hours/rental} = 30 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total income:**
   \[
   \text{Total income} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Payment per hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total income} = 30 \text{ hours} \times 25 \text{ dollars/hour} = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Profit

To find the profit, we need to subtract the car payment from the total income.

1. **Car payment:**
   \[
   \text{Car payment} = 500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Car payment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 750 \text{ dollars} - 500 \text{ dollars} = 250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

John makes a profit of **$250** on his car.
