=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balls Josh is juggling when he walks on stage, and then account for the balls he drops.

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Josh starts practicing with 3 balls.

2. **Weekly Progression**:
   - Each week, Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
   - We need to calculate how many balls he is juggling at the end of each week for 4 weeks.

   - **Week 1**: 
     - Balls = 3 (initial)
   - **Week 2**: 
     - Balls = 3 + 1 = 4
   - **Week 3**: 
     - Balls = 4 + 1 = 5
   - **Week 4**: 
     - Balls = 5 + 1 = 6

   After 4 weeks, Josh is juggling **6 balls**.

3. **Incident on Stage**:
   - When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.
   - We need to calculate how many balls he has left after dropping 3.

   - Balls dropped = 3
   - Balls initially = 6
   - Balls remaining = 6 - 3 = 3

4. **Catching and Losing Balls**:
   - Out of the 3 balls dropped:
     - 2 are caught by people in the crowd.
     - 1 ball is lost completely.

   Since the 2 caught balls are no longer with Josh, we need to account for that as well.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After dropping 3 balls, Josh had 3 left.
   - After 2 balls are caught, he has:
     - Balls remaining = 3 - 2 = 1
   - The lost ball does not affect the count since it is already accounted for in the 3 balls he had left after dropping.

Thus, when Josh starts to juggle on stage, he has **1 ball** left.

**Final Answer**: Josh starts to juggle on stage with **1 ball**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's track how many balls Josh has over the weeks:
* Week 1: Starts with 3 balls
* Week 2: Adds 1 ball → 4 balls
* Week 3: Adds 1 ball → 5 balls
* Week 4: Adds 1 ball → 6 balls

2. At the talent show, Josh has 6 balls when he walks on stage

3. Then several things happen:
* Josh drops 3 balls
* 2 balls are caught by the crowd
* 1 ball is lost in the dark

4. Let's calculate the final number:
* Starting ba...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Josh starts off with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

To find out how many balls Josh has at the end of the 4 weeks, we need to add the number of balls he adds each week to his starting number. 

So, in the first week, Josh has 3 balls. 
In the second week, he adds 1 ball, so he has 3 + 1 = 4 balls. 
In the third week, he adds another ball, so he has 4 + 1 = 5 balls. 
In the fourth week, he adds yet another ball, so he has 5 + 1 = 6 balls. 

So, at the end...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step by step:

1. Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.
2. Each week, he adds 1 ball to his juggling act.
3. The talent show begins after the end of the fourth week.

To find out how many balls Josh is juggling at the start of the talent show, we need to calculate the number of balls he adds over the 4 weeks:

* Week 1: 3 balls (starting number)
* Week 2: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
* Week 3: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
* Week 4: 5 ...
