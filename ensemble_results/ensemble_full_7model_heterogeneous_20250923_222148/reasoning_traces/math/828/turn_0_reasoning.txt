=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much money Mulan has left after her purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Mulan's total money before purchases**:
   - Mulan starts with $40.
   - Her father gives her an additional $100.
   - Total money before purchases = Initial amount + Amount given by father
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 40 + 100 = 140
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the items Mulan buys**:
   - Mulan buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.
   - The cost for the jeans = Number of pairs × Price per pair
   \[
   \text{Cost of jeans} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   - Mulan also buys a bag for $20.
   - Total cost of the bag = $20.
   - Total cost of all items = Cost of jeans + Cost of bag
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 60 + 20 = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate how much money Mulan has left after her purchases**:
   - Money left = Total money before purchases - Total cost of items
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 140 - 80 = 60
   \]

Thus, after buying the jeans and the bag, Mulan has **$60** left.

Final answer: **$60**

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to track Mulan's money as she receives and spends it. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Mulan starts with $40.

2. **Money Received:**
   - Her father gives her an additional $100.
   - To find out how much money Mulan has after receiving the $100, we add this to her initial amount:
     \[
     40 + 100 = 140
     \]
   - So, Mulan now has $140.

3. **Expenses:**

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find Mulan's total starting money:
* Initial money = $40
* Money from father = $100
* Total starting money = $40 + $100 = $140

2. Now, let's calculate her total spending:
* Jeans cost = $30 per pair
* Number of pairs = 2
* Total jeans cost = $30 × 2 = $60
* Bag cost = $20
* Total spending = Jeans cost + Bag cost
* Total spending = $60 + $20 = $80

3. Finally, let's calculate money left:
* Money left...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Mulan initially has $40. Her father gives her an additional $100. 

To find out how much money she has in total, we add these two amounts together:

$40 + $100 = $140

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the items Mulan bought. She bought two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. 

First, let's find out how much the jeans cost in total:

2 jeans * $30/jean = $60

Now, let's add the cost of the bag:

$60 + $20 = $80

So, Mulan spent $80 in total.

Finally, to fin...
