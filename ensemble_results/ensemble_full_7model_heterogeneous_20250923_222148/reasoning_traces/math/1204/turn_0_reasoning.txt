=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total shells discovered**: The total number of shells discovered by the tourists is 700.

2. **Shells found by team Alphas**: 
   - Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells.
   - To calculate the number of shells found by team Alphas, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
     \]

3. **Remaining shells after Alphas**: 
   - To find the number of shells remaining after team Alphas has taken their share, we subtract the shells found by Alphas from the total:
     \[
     \text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420
     \]

4. **Shells found by team The finders**: 
   - Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.
   - To calculate the number of shells found by team The finders, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252
     \]

5. **Shells found by team Gogetters**: 
   - To find the number of shells found by team Gogetters, we need to subtract the shells found by both Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - (\text{Shells found by Alphas} + \text{Shells found by The finders})
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - (280 + 252)
     \]
   - First, calculate the sum of shells found by Alphas and The finders:
     \[
     280 + 252 = 532
     \]
   - Now, subtract this from the total:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Gogetters} = 700 - 532 = 168
     \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   - The number of shells found by team Gogetters is \( \boxed{168} \).

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many shells each group found, specifically focusing on how many shells the team Gogetters found.

1. **Total Number of Shells:**
   - The total number of shells found by all groups is 700.

2. **Shells Found by Team Alphas:**
   - Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells.
   - To find the number of shells they found, calculate 40% of 700:
     \[
     \text{Shells found by Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the total number of shells:
* Total shells = 700

2. Find how many shells team Alphas found (40% of total):
* Alphas = 40% of 700
* Alphas = 0.40 × 700 = 280 shells

3. Find the remaining shells after Alphas:
* Remaining = Total - Alphas
* Remaining = 700 - 280 = 420 shells

4. Find how many shells The finders found (60% of remaining):
* The finders = 60% of 420
* The finders = 0.60 × 420 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many shells team Alphas found. 

Since team Alphas found 40% of the shells, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of shells by 40% (or 0.40). 

700 shells * 0.40 = 280 shells

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells. 

We do this by subtracting the number of shells team Alphas found from the total number of shells:

700 shells - 280 shells = 4...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 700 shells in total.
   * Team Alphas found 40% of the total shells.
   * Team The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.
   * We need to find the number of shells team Gogetters found.

2. Calculate the number of shells team Alphas found:
   * Team Alphas found 40% of 700 shells.
   * 40% of 700 = 0.4 × 700 = 280 shells
   So, team Alphas found 280...
