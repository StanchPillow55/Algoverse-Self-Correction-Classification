Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba**: 
   We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that it has twice as many spots as a mamba. Let \( m \) represent the number of spots on a mamba. According to the problem:

   \[
   70 = 2m
   \]

   To find \( m \), we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   m = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

   So, a mamba has 35 spots.

2. **Calculate the total number of spots for all cobras**:
   There are 40 cobras, and each cobra has 70 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all cobras is:

   \[
   \text{Total spots from cobras} = 40 \times 70 = 2800
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of spots for all mambas**:
   There are 60 mambas, and each mamba has 35 spots. Therefore, the total number of spots for all mambas is:

   \[
   \text{Total spots from mambas} = 60 \times 35 = 2100
   \]

4. **Calculate the combined total number of spots**:
   Now, we can find the combined total number of spots from both cobras and mambas:

   \[
   \text{Combined total spots} = \text{Total spots from cobras} + \text{Total spots from mambas}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Combined total spots} = 2800 + 2100 = 4900
   \]

5. **Find half of the combined total number of spots**:
   Finally, we need to find half of the combined total number of spots:

   \[
   \text{Half of combined total spots} = \frac{4900}{2} = 2450
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2450}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- A cobra has 70 spots.
- A cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba.
- There are 40 cobras and 60 mambas in the snake park.

Step 1: Find the number of spots on a mamba.
Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, we can divide the number of spots on a cobra by 2 to find the number of spots on a mamba.
Number of spots on a mamba = 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots

Step 2: Find the total number of s...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of spots on all the cobras and mambas in the snake park, and then find half of that total.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of spots on a mamba:**
   - We know that a cobra has 70 spots and that this is twice as many spots as a mamba.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of spots on a mamba.
   - According to the problem, \( 70 = 2x \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how many spots a mamba has:
* If a cobra has 70 spots and it's twice as many as a mamba
* Then a mamba has: 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots

2. Now let's find the total spots on all cobras:
* Number of cobras = 40
* Spots per cobra = 70
* Total cobra spots = 40 × 70 = 2,800 spots

3. Next, let's find the total spots on all mambas:
* Number of mambas = 60
* Spots per mamba = 35
* Total mamba spots = 60 × 35 = ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba must have 70/2 = 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras in the park have combined. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, the total number of spots on all the cobras is 40 * 70 = 2800 spots.

Similarly, we can find out how many spots all the mambas in the park have combined. Since there are 6...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * A cobra has 70 spots.
   * A mamba has half the number of spots as a cobra.
   * There are 40 cobras in the snake park.
   * There are 60 mambas in the snake park.

2. Calculate the number of spots on a mamba:
   * A mamba has half the spots of a cobra.
   * Spots on a mamba = 70 ÷ 2 = 35 spots

3. Calculate the total number of spots on all the cobras:
