Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour and then calculate his earnings based on that.

1. **Determine the number of packages Colby completes in an hour:**
   - The problem states that Colby completes "10 less than 50 packages per hour."
   - To find out how many packages he completes, we calculate:
     \[
     50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate Colby's earnings per hour:**
   - Colby earns $0.20 for each package he completes.
   - Therefore, his earnings for one hour can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Earnings per hour} = \text{Number of packages} \times \text{Earnings per package}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings per hour} = 40 \text{ packages} \times 0.20 \text{ dollars/package} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Colby's total earnings for an eight-hour workday:**
   - To find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday, we multiply his hourly earnings by the number of hours he works:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for 8 hours} = \text{Earnings per hour} \times \text{Number of hours}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for 8 hours} = 8 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 64 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Colby earns a total of **$64** in a typical eight-hour workday.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in an hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we subtract 10 from 50 to find this number:

50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour

Next, we need to determine how much money Colby earns per hour. He earns $0.20 for every package he completes, so we multiply the number of packages he completes in an hour by the amount he earns per package:

40 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $8.00...
