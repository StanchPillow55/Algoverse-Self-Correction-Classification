Final Answer: To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June**: 
   June has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total distance Soledad plans to hike with her current plan**:
   Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. Therefore, the total distance she will cover in one day is:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles/time} \times 2 \text{ times/day} = 250 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance she will hike in June with her current plan**:
   If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, the total distance she will hike in June is:
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine how many more miles she needs to hike to reach her goal**:
   Soledad's goal is to hike 9,300 miles. The difference between her goal and her planned distance is:
   \[
   9300 \text{ miles} - 7500 \text{ miles} = 1800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many additional miles she needs to hike per day**:
   To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day to meet her goal, we divide the additional miles needed by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \frac{1800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

6. **Determine her new daily hiking goal**:
   Soledad's current daily hiking distance is 250 miles. To meet her goal, she needs to hike an additional 60 miles per day:
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} + 60 \text{ miles/day} = 310 \text{ miles/day}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Soledad must hike **60 more miles per day** to complete her journey on time.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the key information:
* Total distance goal = 9,300 miles
* Time period = month of June (30 days)
* Current planned hiking = 125 miles × 2 times per day
* Need to find additional miles needed per day

2. Calculate how many miles Soledad plans to hike per day:
* Miles per day = 125 miles × 2 times
* Miles per day = 250 miles

3. Calculate total miles she would cover in June at current plan:
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Soledad plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. This means she will cover 125 miles * 2 = 250 miles per day.

The month of June has 30 days. So, if she walks 250 miles per day for 30 days, she will cover 250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles.

Soledad's goal is to hike 9300 miles in June. If she walks 7500 miles as planned, she will still need to cover 9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles.

Therefore, Soledad needs to walk an additional 1800 miles over 30 ...
