Final Answer: To determine how much Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly earnings from aluminum cans.**
   - Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans of soda each week.
   - Each aluminum can is worth 2 cents.
   - Therefore, the earnings from aluminum cans per week can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Value per can}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} = 3 \text{ cans} \times 2 \text{ cents/can} = 6 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Calculate the weekly earnings from plastic bottles.**
   - Grayson drinks 5 plastic bottles of water each week.
   - Each plastic bottle is worth 3 cents.
   - Therefore, the earnings from plastic bottles per week can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Value per bottle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from plastic bottles} = 5 \text{ bottles} \times 3 \text{ cents/bottle} = 15 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weekly earnings.**
   - Now, we will add the earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find the total earnings per week:
     \[
     \text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from aluminum cans} + \text{Earnings from plastic bottles}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weekly earnings} = 6 \text{ cents} + 15 \text{ cents} = 21 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for a four-week month.**
   - To find out how much Grayson earns in a four-week month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by 4:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for four weeks} = \text{Total weekly earnings} \times 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings for four weeks} = 21 \text{ cents/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, Grayson earns a total of **84 cents** from recycling in a four-week month.

Final answer: **84 cents**.
