=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of men to women**: The ratio of men to women is given as 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

2. **Set up the equations based on the ratio**: Let the number of men be \( 5x \) and the number of women be \( 9x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

3. **Express the total number of passengers**: The total number of passengers on the bus is the sum of men and women:
   \[
   5x + 9x = 14x
   \]
   We know from the problem that the total number of passengers is 84. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   14x = 84
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{84}{14} = 6
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of men and women**:
   - Number of men:
     \[
     5x = 5 \times 6 = 30
     \]
   - Number of women:
     \[
     9x = 9 \times 6 = 54
     \]

6. **Determine how many women remain after 20 women alight**: Initially, there are 54 women on the bus. After 20 women get off, the number of women remaining is:
   \[
   54 - 20 = 34
   \]

7. **Final answer**: The number of women remaining on the bus is \( \boxed{34} \).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
- The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
- 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop.

Step 1: Find the number of men and women on the bus initially.
Total number of passengers = 84
Ratio of men to women = 5:9
Let's represent the number of men as 5x and the number of women as 9x, where x is a common factor.
Total number of passengers =...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of men and women on the bus and then calculate how many women remain after some have alighted.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of men and women

The ratio of men to women on the bus is given as 5:9. This means for every 5 men, there are 9 women. We are also told that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84.

Let's denote the number of men as \( M \) and the number of women as \( W \).

Accor...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) First, let's understand what the ratio 5:9 means for men and women
   * Let's find what one part of the ratio represents
   * Total parts = 5 + 9 = 14 parts
   * Total passengers = 84
   * So, one part = 84 ÷ 14 = 6 passengers

2) Now we can find the initial number of men and women
   * Men = 5 parts = 5 × 6 = 30 men
   * Women = 9 parts = 9 × 6 = 54 women
   * Verify: 30 + 54 = 84 total passengers ✓

3) After 20...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total ratio is therefore 5 + 9 = 14 parts.

We are told that the total number of passengers on the bus is 84. Each part of the ratio therefore represents 84 ÷ 14 = 6 passengers.

The number of women on the bus is represented by 9 parts of the ratio. Therefore, the number of women on the bus is 9 × 6 = 54.

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, the number of wom...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9.
   * The total number of passengers on the bus is 84.
   * 20 women alight (get off) from the bus at the next stop.

2. Find the total number of parts in the ratio:
   * Men : Women = 5 : 9
   * Total parts = 5 + 9 = 14

3. Calculate the number of men and women on the bus initially:
   * Each part represents: 84 ÷ 14 =...
