=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( D \) represent the time (in minutes) that Donovan spent on his part of the meal.
   - Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   D + (D + 18) = 98
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation**:
   - Combine like terms:
   \[
   2D + 18 = 98
   \]

4. **Isolate the Variable**:
   - Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   2D = 98 - 18
   \]
   \[
   2D = 80
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   D = \frac{80}{2} = 40
   \]

5. **Find Betsy's Time**:
   - Now that we have \( D \), we can find Betsy's time:
   \[
   \text{Betsy's time} = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Betsy's part took **58 minutes**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{58}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the duration of Betsy's part in making the meal.

Given information:
- Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
- The total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.

Let's represent the duration of Donovan's part as x minutes.

Step 1: Express the duration of Betsy's part in terms of Donovan's part.
Betsy's part = Donovan's part + 18 minutes
Betsy's part = x + 18 minutes

Step 2: Find the total time ...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the time Betsy spent on her part of making the meal. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( D \) represent the time in minutes that Donovan spent on his part.
   - Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's, we can express Betsy's time as \( D + 18 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - We know that the total time for making the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, the sum of th...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1) Let's identify what we know:
* Total time for the meal = 98 minutes
* Betsy's time = Donovan's time + 18 minutes
* We need to find Betsy's time

2) Let's use variables to set up an equation:
* Let's say Donovan's time = x minutes
* Then Betsy's time = x + 18 minutes
* Total time = Betsy's time + Donovan's time
* 98 = (x + 18) + x

3) Solve the equation:
* 98 = x + 18 + x
* 98 = 2x + 18
* 98 - 18 = 2x
* 80 = 2x
* ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the time it took Donovan to make his part of the meal as D. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can denote Betsy's time as D + 18.

The problem states that the total time to make the meal was 98 minutes. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

D (Donovan's time) + D + 18 (Betsy's time) = 98

This simplifies to:

2D + 18 = 98

To solve for D, we first subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Betsy and Donovan made a meal together.
   * Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.
   * The total time to make the meal was 98 minutes.

2. Let's define variables to represent the unknown times:
   * Let x = Donovan's time in minutes
   * Then, Betsy's time = x + 18 minutes

3. Set up an equation based on the total time:
   * Total time = Donov...
