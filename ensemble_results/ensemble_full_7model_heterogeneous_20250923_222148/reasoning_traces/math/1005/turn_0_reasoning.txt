Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines.**
2. **Calculate the total number of babies born in a year.**
3. **Calculate the total population after a year.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines

The total population of porcupines in the park is given as 50. We know that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3 \times 50}{5} = \frac{150}{5} = 30
\]

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born by one female porcupine in a year (which has 12 months) is:

\[
\text{Babies per female per year} = 4 \times 12 = 48
\]

Now, since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total babies born in a year} = 30 \times 48
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total babies born in a year} = 1440
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total population after a year

To find the total population after a year, we need to add the original population to the number of babies born:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = \text{Original population} + \text{Total babies born}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of porcupines in the park after a year will be:

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The total population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- We need to find the number of porcupines in the park after a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 × 50 = 30 female porcupines

Step 2: Calculate the n...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of porcupines in the park after a year, given the initial population and the birth rate of the female porcupines.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Female Porcupines:**

   The problem states that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. The initial population is 50 porcupines.

   \[
   \text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Find the number of female porcupines:
* Total population = 50 porcupines
* Female portion = 3/5 of total
* Number of females = 50 × (3/5) = 30 female porcupines

2. Calculate babies born per month:
* Each female has 4 babies
* Number of females = 30
* Babies per month = 30 females × 4 babies = 120 babies per month

3. Calculate total babies born in a year:
* Months in a year = 12
* Total babies = 120 babies/month...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are in the park. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we multiply the total population by 3/5:

50 * 3/5 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Next, we need to find out how many babies each female porcupine will have in a year. We know that each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, we multiply 4 by...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this problem down step-by-step:

Given:
- The current population of porcupines in the park is 50.
- The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.
- Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.
- We need to find the number of porcupines after a year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of female porcupines.
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 × Total population
Number of female porcupines = 3/5 × 50 = 30
