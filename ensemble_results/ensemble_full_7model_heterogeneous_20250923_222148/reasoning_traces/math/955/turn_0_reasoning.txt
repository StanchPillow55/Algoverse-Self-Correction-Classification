=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of occupied beds.**
2. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.**
3. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.**
4. **Determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.**

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of occupied beds

The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds, and it is stated that \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the beds are occupied.

\[
\text{Initial occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks

We know that 50 patients are admitted each day. We need to find out how many patients are admitted over 2 weeks (which is 14 days).

\[
\text{Total patients admitted in 2 weeks} = 50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks

Initially, there are 200 occupied beds. After admitting 700 patients, we need to add this number to the initial occupied beds.

\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = \text{Initial occupied beds} + \text{Patients admitted}
\]
\[
\text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks

Now, we can find the number of unoccupied beds by subtracting the total occupied beds from the total capacity of the hospital.

\[
\text{Total unoccupied beds} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total occupied beds after 2 weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is \( \boxed{100} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of occupied beds.**
2. **Calculate the number of patients admitted over 2 weeks.**
3. **Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks.**
4. **Determine the total number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.**

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
2. Calculate the number of beds occupied after 2 weeks.
3. Calculate the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of occupied beds initially.
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied.
Number of occupied beds initially = 1/5 × 1000 = 200 beds

Step 2: Calculate the number of beds occupied...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, given the initial conditions and the daily admission rate.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Initial Number of Occupied Beds:**
   - The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   - Initially, 1/5 of the beds are occupied.
   - Calculate the number of occupied beds initially:
     \[
     \text{Occupied beds initially} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the initial number of occupied beds
* Hospital capacity = 1000 beds
* 1/5 of beds are occupied
* Initial occupied beds = 1000 × (1/5) = 200 beds

2. Calculate initial number of unoccupied beds
* Initial unoccupied beds = Total beds - Occupied beds
* Initial unoccupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

3. Calculate how many new patients will be admitted in 2 weeks
* Daily new patients = 50
* Number o...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): The first step is to determine the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital. Since the hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied, we multiply 1000 by 1/5:

1000 * 1/5 = 200 beds

This means that there are 200 beds currently occupied in the hospital.

Next, we need to calculate the number of new patients that will be admitted into the hospital over the next two weeks. Since 50 patients are admitted each day, and there are 14 days in two wee...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The hospital has a total capacity of 1000 beds.
   * 1/5 of the beds are currently occupied.
   * 50 new patients are admitted each day due to the coronavirus outbreak.
   * We need to find the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks (14 days).

2. Calculate the number of beds currently occupied:
   * Occupied beds = 1/5 of total beds
   * Occupied beds = 1/5 × 1000
