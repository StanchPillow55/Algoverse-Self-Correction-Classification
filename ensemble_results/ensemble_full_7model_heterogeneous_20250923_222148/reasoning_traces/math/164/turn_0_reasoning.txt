=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total costs and lost income associated with both options.

1. **Calculate the lost income if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - Jackie will lose 3 hours of freelance work.
   - She earns $35 per hour.
   - The total lost income can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Lost Income} = \text{Hours Lost} \times \text{Hourly Rate} = 3 \, \text{hours} \times 35 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 105 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie does her taxes herself:**
   - The total cost when doing taxes herself is simply the lost income, which we calculated as $105.

3. **Calculate the total cost if Jackie hires an accountant:**
   - The accountant charges $90.
   - This is the total cost for hiring the accountant.

4. **Compare the two options:**
   - If Jackie does her taxes herself, she effectively "pays" $105 in lost income.
   - If she hires the accountant, she pays $90.

5. **Calculate the difference in costs:**
   - To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the cost of doing it herself:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Doing Taxes Herself} - \text{Cost of Hiring Accountant} = 105 \, \text{dollars} - 90 \, \text{dollars} = 15 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have **$15 more** than if she does her taxes herself.

**Final Answer: Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much money Jackie would lose if she does her taxes herself. She would lose 3 hours of freelance work, and she earns $35 per hour. So, the total amount of money she would lose is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Next, we compare this to the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90.
