=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the net cost of the new bedroom set after selling the old one.**
   - Tom buys a new bedroom set for $3000.
   - He sells his old bedroom set for $1000.
   - The amount he needs to pay after selling the old bedroom set is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Net cost} = \text{Cost of new bedroom set} - \text{Sale of old bedroom set}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Net cost} = 3000 - 1000 = 2000
     \]

2. **Calculate the monthly payment based on the interest rate.**
   - Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining balance of $2000.
   - The monthly payment can be calculated by finding 10% of the net cost:
     \[
     \text{Monthly payment} = 10\% \text{ of } 2000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Monthly payment} = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Tom has to pay **$200** per month for the bedroom set.

In conclusion, the amount Tom has to pay per month is **$200**.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find how much Tom still owes after using the money from his old bedroom set:
* Original cost: $3000
* Money from old set: $1000
* Remaining balance = $3000 - $1000 = $2000

2. Now we need to calculate 10% of the remaining balance:
* 10% = 10/100 = 0.10
* Monthly payment = $2000 Ã— 0.10
* Monthly payment = $200

Reasoning:
- Tom used the $1000 from selling his old set as a down payment
- He needs to pa...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to determine how much Tom still owes for the new bedroom set after selling his old one. He bought the new set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Next, we need to calculate how much Tom has to pay per month. The problem states that he has to pay 10% of the remaining cost per month. To find this, we multiply the remaining cost by 10% (or 0.10 in decimal form).

$2000 * 0.10 = $200

So, Tom has to pay $200 per m...
