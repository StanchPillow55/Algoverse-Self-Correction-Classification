Final Answer: To find out how much money James has in total, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin he found and then sum those values.

1. **Identify the coins and their values**:
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.

2. **Calculate the total value of each type of coin**:
   - **Value of the quarter**: 
     \[
     1 \text{ quarter} = 25 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - **Value of the nickels**:
     James found 2 nickels, so we calculate:
     \[
     2 \text{ nickels} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

   - **Value of the dimes**:
     James found 7 dimes, so we calculate:
     \[
     7 \text{ dimes} = 7 \times 10 \text{ cents} = 70 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Sum the values of all the coins**:
   Now we add the values of the quarter, the nickels, and the dimes:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = \text{Value of quarter} + \text{Value of nickels} + \text{Value of dimes}
   \]
   Substituting in the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total value} = 25 \text{ cents} + 10 \text{ cents} + 70 \text{ cents}
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   25 + 10 = 35
   \]
   \[
   35 + 70 = 105
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of money James has is:
   \[
   \boxed{105} \text{ cents}
   \]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of determining how much money James has found in the vending machine coin return, we need to calculate the total value of the coins he found. James found the following coins:

- 1 quarter
- 2 nickels
- 7 dimes

Let's calculate the value of each type of coin in cents and then sum them up.

1. **Quarter:**
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - James found 1 quarter, so the total value from the quarter is:
     \[
     1 \times 25 = 25 \text{ cents}
  ...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify the value of each coin:
* Quarter = 25 cents
* Nickel = 5 cents
* Dime = 10 cents

2. Let's count what James found:
* 1 quarter = 1 × 25 cents = 25 cents
* 2 nickels = 2 × 5 cents = 10 cents
* 7 dimes = 7 × 10 cents = 70 cents

3. Now add all the values:
* Total = Quarter + Nickels + Dimes
* Total = 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents

Final Answer: James has 105 cents.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we need to know the value of each coin in cents. 

A quarter is worth 25 cents, a nickel is worth 5 cents, and a dime is worth 10 cents.

James has 1 quarter, 2 nickels, and 7 dimes.

First, we calculate the total value of the quarter:
1 quarter * 25 cents = 25 cents
