Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Peter and Martha have in each of their boxes and then find the difference between the two.

1. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Peter:**
   - Peter has 4 boxes and a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Peter has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars Peter has can be expressed as:
     \[
     4p = 64
     \]
   - To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     p = \frac{64}{4} = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

2. **Determine the number of chocolate bars in each box for Martha:**
   - Martha has 7 boxes and a total of 56 chocolate bars.
   - Let \( m \) be the number of chocolate bars in each box that Martha has.
   - The total number of chocolate bars Martha has can be expressed as:
     \[
     7m = 56
     \]
   - To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:
     \[
     m = \frac{56}{7} = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of chocolate bars per box:**
   - Now we need to find how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = p - m = 16 - 8 = 8
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's and Martha's boxes, and then find the difference between these amounts.

**Step 1: Determine the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.**

Peter has 4 boxes, and the total number of chocolate bars he has is 64. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes:

\[
\text{Number of chocol...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's identify what we know:
* Peter has 4 boxes with equal amounts in each
* Martha has 7 boxes with equal amounts in each
* Peter has 64 total chocolate bars
* Martha has 56 total chocolate bars

2. Let's find how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes:
* Peter's total ÷ number of boxes = bars per box
* 64 ÷ 4 = 16 chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes

3. Let's find how many chocolate bars are in e...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box for both Peter and Martha. 

Since Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes, we divide 64 by 4 to find out how many bars are in each of Peter's boxes. 

64 ÷ 4 = 16

So, each of Peter's boxes contains 16 chocolate bars.

Next, we do the same for Martha. She has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes, so we divide 56 by 7 to find out how many bars are in each of Martha's boxes.

56 ÷ 7 = 8

So, each of Martha's boxes c...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * Peter has 4 boxes, each containing the same number of chocolate bars.
   * Martha has 7 boxes, each containing the same number of chocolate bars.
   * Peter has a total of 64 chocolate bars.
   * Martha has a total of 56 chocolate bars.

2. Find the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes:
   * Peter's total chocolate bars = Number of boxes × Chocolate ...
