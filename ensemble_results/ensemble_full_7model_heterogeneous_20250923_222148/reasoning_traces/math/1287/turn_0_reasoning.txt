=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to find the total age of all the siblings in the family, which consists of 2 brothers and 3 sisters. 

1. **Identify the ages of the sisters:**
   - There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total age of the sisters can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Identify the ages of the brothers:**
   - One brother is 12 years old.
   - We know that this brother's age (12 years) is half the age of the older brother. Let’s denote the age of the older brother as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, we have:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} x
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Thus, the older brother is 24 years old.

3. **Calculate the total age of the brothers:**
   - Now we can find the total age of both brothers:
     \[
     \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings:**
   - Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers to find the total age of all siblings:
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = \text{Total age of sisters} + \text{Total age of brothers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all the siblings is \( \boxed{84} \) years.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family.
- All sisters are the same age, which is 16 years old.
- One of the brothers is 12 years old.
- The older brother's age is twice the younger brother's age.

Step 1: Find the age of the older brother.
Since the younger brother is 12 years old, and his age is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of all the siblings and then sum them up to find the total age.

1. **Determine the age of the sisters:**
   - There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.

2. **Calculate the total age of the sisters:**
   - Since each sister is 16 years old, the total age of the sisters is:
     \[
     3 \times 16 = 48
     \]

3. **Determine the age of the brothers:**
   - We know one of the brothers is 12 years old.
   - ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given information:
* 2 brothers and 3 sisters
* All sisters are 16 years old
* Younger brother is 12 years old
* Younger brother's age is half of older brother's age

Step 1: Find the older brother's age
* If 12 is half of older brother's age
* Then older brother's age = 12 × 2 = 24 years old

Step 2: Calculate total age of sisters
* Each sister is 16 years old
* Number of sisters = 3
* Total age of sisters = 16 × 3...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. Since all three sisters are 16 years old, we multiply 16 by 3. 

16 * 3 = 48 years

Next, we know that one of the brothers is 12 years old. 

The problem states that the 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother. This means the older brother is twice as old as the 12-year-old brother. 

12 * 2 = 24 years

Now, we add up the ages of all the siblings to find the total age. 

48 (total age of sisters) + 12 (...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters in the family.
   * All sisters are 16 years old.
   * One brother is 12 years old.
   * The 12-year-old brother is half the age of the older brother.

2. Find the age of the older brother:
   * Let's say the older brother's age is x.
   * The younger brother's age is half of the older brother's age, so we can write an equation:
