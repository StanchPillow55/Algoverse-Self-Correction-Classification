Final Answer: To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has.

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
     \[
     5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Kelly has 2 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has:**
   - Now, we add the total value of the quarters and the dimes:
     \[
     125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Subtract the cost of the can of pop:**
   - The can of pop costs 55 cents.
   - To find out how much money Kelly has left after the purchase, we subtract the cost of the pop from her total amount:
     \[
     145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes.
- The can of pop costs 55 cents.

Step 1: Calculate the total value of Kelly's coins.
5 quarters = 5 × $0.25 = $1.25
2 dimes = 2 × $0.10 = $0.20
Total value of Kelly's coins = $1.25 + $0.20 = $1.45

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the can of pop.
Cost of the can of pop = 55 cents

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate how much money Kelly has:
* Quarters = 5 × 25¢ = 125¢
* Dimes = 2 × 10¢ = 20¢
* Total money = 125¢ + 20¢ = 145¢

2. Kelly buys a can of pop for 55¢
* Money remaining = Total money - Cost of pop
* Money remaining = 145¢ - 55¢ = 90¢

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.

Final answer: 90 cents

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Kelly has. 

Quarters are worth 25 cents each and dimes are worth 10 cents each. 

So, the total amount of money Kelly has in quarters is 5 quarters * 25 cents/quarter = 125 cents. 

The total amount of money Kelly has in dimes is 2 dimes * 10 cents/dime = 20 cents. 

Adding these two amounts together, Kelly has 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents in total. 

Next, we need to subtract the cost of the can of pop from the t...
