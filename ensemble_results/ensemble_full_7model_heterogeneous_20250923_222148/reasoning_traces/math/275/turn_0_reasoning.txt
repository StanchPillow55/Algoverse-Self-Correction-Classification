=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song Lines**:
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the song is:
     \[
     \text{Lines from song} = 54
     \]

2. **First Scene Lines**:
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
   - Therefore, the total number of lines in the first scene is:
     \[
     \text{Lines in first scene} = 2 \times 54 = 108
     \]
   - Only a third of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
     \[
     \text{Sean's lines in first scene} = \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36
     \]

3. **Second Scene Lines**:
   - The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.
   - Therefore, the total number of lines in the second scene is:
     \[
     \text{Lines in second scene} = 54 + 6 = 60
     \]
   - Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's lines. Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
     \[
     \text{Sean's lines in second scene} = \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48
     \]

4. **Total Lines Memorized**:
   - Now, we can find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize by adding the lines from the song, the first scene, and the second scene:
     \[
     \text{Total lines} = \text{Lines from song} + \text{Sean's lines in first scene} + \text{Sean's lines in second scene}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total lines} = 54 + 36 + 48
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total lines} = 138
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is \( \boxed{138} \).

Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song Lines**:
   - The solo song has 54 lines.
   - Therefore, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the song is:
     \[
     \text{Lines from song} = 54
     \]

2. **First Scene Lines**:
   - The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sean has to memorize the lyrics to one solo song, which has 54 lines.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so that's 2 x 54 = 108 lines.
   However, only a third of those lines are Sean's, so that's 108 / 3 = 36 lines.

3. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so that's 54 + 6 = 60 lines.
   Four-fifths of those lines are Sean's, so that's 60 x 4/5 = 48 lines.

Now we...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many lines Sean has to memorize for his role in the theater production. We will break down the problem into parts and calculate the number of lines for each component: the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene.

**Step 1: Solo Song**
- The solo song has 54 lines.
- Since it's a solo song, all 54 lines are Sean's lines.

**Step 2: First Scene**
- The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song.
- Th...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's first identify what we know:
* Solo song has 54 lines
* First scene has twice the number of lines as the song
* 1/3 of first scene lines are Sean's
* Second scene has 6 more lines than the song
* 4/5 of second scene lines are Sean's

2. Calculate first scene total lines:
* Song has 54 lines
* First scene = 54 × 2 = 108 lines total

3. Calculate Sean's lines in first scene:
* Sean's lines = 108 × (1/3)
* Sea...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sean's solo song has 54 lines. So, he has to memorize all of these lines.

Second, the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. That means the first scene has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.

Third, the second scene has six more lines than the song. That means the second scene has 54 + 6 = 60 lin...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Sean's solo song has 54 lines.

2. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. 
   * Lines in first scene = 54 × 2 = 108 lines
   * But only 1/3 of those lines are Sean's
   * Sean's lines in first scene = 108 ÷ 3 = 36 lines

3. The second scene has 6 more lines than the song.
   * Lines in second scene = 54 + 6 = 60 lines  
   * 4/5 of those lines are Sean's
   * Sean's lines in second scene...
