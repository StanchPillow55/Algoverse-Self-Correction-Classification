=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cats**: 
   We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats Carried Away by Boats**: 
   There are 4 boats, and each boat carries away 5 cats. 
   To find the total number of cats carried away, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total cats carried away} = 4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats/boat} = 20 \text{ cats}
   \]

3. **Remaining Cats After Boats**: 
   We subtract the number of cats carried away from the initial number of cats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cats} = 50 \text{ cats} - 20 \text{ cats} = 30 \text{ cats}
   \]

4. **Cats Running After the Mouse**: 
   Now, we need to find out how many of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining cats ran after the mouse. 
   We calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 30 cats:
   \[
   \text{Cats running after the mouse} = \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats}
   \]

5. **Final Number of Cats Left on the Rock**: 
   We subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the remaining cats:
   \[
   \text{Cats left on the rock} = 30 \text{ cats} - 18 \text{ cats} = 12 \text{ cats}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **12 cats left on the rock**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of cats on the rock:
   * 50 cats

2. Cats carried away by the boats:
   * 4 boats, each carrying 5 cats
   * 4 x 5 = 20 cats carried away

3. Remaining cats on the rock after the boats left:
   * 50 - 20 = 30 cats

4. Cats that ran after the mouse:
   * 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after the mouse
   * 3/5 x 30 = 18 cats ran after the mouse

5. Cats left on the rock:
   * 30 - 18 = 12 cats

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the sequence of events described and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Cats:**
   - We start with 50 cats on the rock.

2. **Cats Taken by Boats:**
   - Four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats.
   - To find out how many cats were taken by the boats, we multiply the number of boats by the number of cats each boat carried:
     \[
     4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats/bo...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Initial number of cats on rock = 50 cats

2. Four boats took 5 cats each
* Number of cats taken by boats = 4 × 5 = 20 cats
* Cats remaining after boats left = 50 - 20 = 30 cats

3. Then 3/5 of remaining cats ran after a mouse
* Number of cats that ran after mouse = 3/5 × 30 = 18 cats
* Cats remaining on rock = 30 - 18 = 12 cats

Explanation of reasoning:
- First I calculated how many cats were taken away by boats...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Step 1: Determine the number of cats taken by the boats
Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each. This means that the total number of cats taken by the boats is 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.

Step 2: Calculate the number of cats left on the rock after the boats left
There were initially 50 cats on the rock. After the boats took 20 cats, the number of cats left on the rock is 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats.

Step 3: Determine the number of cats that ran after the mouse...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's solve this problem step by step:

Given:
- Initially, there were 50 cats on the rock.
- Four boats carried away 5 cats each.
- Later, 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cats carried away by the boats.
Cats carried away = Number of boats × Cats per boat
Cats carried away = 4 × 5 = 20 cats

Step 2: Calculate the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left.
Remaining cats after boats = I...
