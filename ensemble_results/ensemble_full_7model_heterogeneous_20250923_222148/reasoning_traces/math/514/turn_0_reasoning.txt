=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( L \) be the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) be the cost of the house.

2. **Set Up the Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - We are also told that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute the Second Equation into the First**:
   - We can substitute \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combining the terms on the left side gives us:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - To find \( L \), divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Find \( H \)**:
   - Now that we have \( L \), we can find \( H \) using the second equation:
     \[
     H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( H = 90,000 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The house cost } \$90,000.
\]

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The house and the lot cost $120,000 in total.
- The house cost three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can write an equation:
x + 3x = $120,000

Simplifying the equation:
4x = $120,000

Solving for x:
x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

Th...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of the house given that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's use algebra to set up the problem:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot.
   - Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house can be represented as \( 3L \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the ...

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Total cost (house + lot) = $120,000
- House cost = 3 × lot cost

Step 1: Let's use variables to set up an equation
* Let x = lot cost
* Then 3x = house cost
* Total cost equation: x + 3x = 120,000

Step 2: Combine like terms
* 4x = 120,000 (where x is the lot cost)

Step 3: Solve for x (lot cost)
* x = 120,000 ÷ 4
* x = 30,000
* So the lot cost = $30,000

Step 4: Calculate house cost
* House cost = 3 × lot ...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can denote the cost of the house as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

x (cost of the lot) + 3x (cost of the house) = $120,000

Combining like terms gives us:

4x = $120,000

To find the value of x (the cost of the lot), we divide both sides of...

--- Model 7 Response ---
Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step. We need to find the cost of the house, given that the house and lot together cost $120,000, and the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Given:
- The house and lot together cost $120,000.
- The house costs three times as much as the lot.

Step 1: Let's assign a variable to the cost of the lot.
Let x = the cost of the lot

Step 2: Express the cost of the house in terms of the lot.
The house costs t...
