=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find out how much change Verna received after buying the fruit, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased.

1. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   - Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each.
   - Total cost for apples = Number of apples × Price per apple
   \[
   \text{Total cost for apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the oranges:**
   - Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
   - Total cost for oranges = Number of oranges × Price per orange
   \[
   \text{Total cost for oranges} = 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the peaches:**
   - Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
   - Total cost for peaches = Number of peaches × Price per peach
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peaches} = 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all the fruit:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for apples + Total cost for oranges + Total cost for peaches
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the change Verna received:**
   - Verna gave $20 for the fruit.
   - Change = Amount given - Total cost
   \[
   \text{Change} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
   \]

Thus, the amount of change Verna received is \(\boxed{7.00}\).

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each
- Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each
- Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each
- Verna gave $20

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the fruits.
Cost of apples = 3 × $1.50 = $4.50
Cost of oranges = 5 × $0.80 = $4.00
Cost of peaches = 6 × $0.75 = $4.50
Total cost = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50 = $13.00

Step 2: Calculate the change Verna received.
Change = Amount giv...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought and then determine how much change she received from the $20 she gave.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   Verna bought three apples, each costing $1.50.
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's calculate the cost of apples:
* 3 apples × $1.50 = $4.50

2. Next, let's calculate the cost of oranges:
* 5 oranges × $0.80 = $4.00

3. Then, let's calculate the cost of peaches:
* 6 peaches × $0.75 = $4.50

4. Now, let's add up the total cost:
* Total = Apples + Oranges + Peaches
* Total = $4.50 + $4.00 + $4.50
* Total = $13.00

5. Finally, let's calculate the change:
* Change = Money given - Total ...

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits that Verna bought.

The cost of the apples is 3 (the number of apples) times $1.50 (the cost per apple), which equals $4.50.

The cost of the oranges is 5 (the number of oranges) times $0.80 (the cost per orange), which equals $4.00.

The cost of the peaches is 6 (the number of peaches) times $0.75 (the cost per peach), which equals $4.50.

Adding these three amounts together, we find that the ...
