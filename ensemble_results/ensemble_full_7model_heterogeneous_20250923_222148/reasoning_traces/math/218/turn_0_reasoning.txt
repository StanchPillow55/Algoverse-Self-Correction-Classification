=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age**:
   - We know from the problem that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's current age**:
   - The problem states that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
   - Since Harriet is 21 years old, we can calculate Adrian's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Zack's current age**:
   - The problem also states that Harriet is half the age of Zack.
   - To find Zack's age, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Harriet's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Zack's age}
     \]
   - Rearranging this gives us:
     \[
     \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Summarize the current ages**:
   - Adrian: 63 years old
   - Harriet: 21 years old
   - Zack: 42 years old

5. **Calculate the average age of the three in three years**:
   - In three years, each person's age will increase by 3 years.
   - Adrian's age in three years:
     \[
     63 + 3 = 66 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Harriet's age in three years:
     \[
     21 + 3 = 24 \text{ years old}
     \]
   - Zack's age in three years:
     \[
     42 + 3 = 45 \text{ years old}
     \]

6. **Calculate the average age**:
   - The average age of the three in three years can be calculated using the formula for average:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Adrian's age} + \text{Harriet's age} + \text{Zack's age}}{3}
     \]
   - Plugging in the ages we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{66 + 24 + 45}{3}
     \]
   - First, calculate the sum:
     \[
     66 + 24 + 45 = 135
     \]
   - Now, divide by 3 to find the average:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{135}{3} = 45
     \]

Thus, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be \( \boxed{45} \).

--- Model 1 Response ---
Model 1 (openai:gpt-4o-mini): To solve the problem, we will first determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Harriet's current age**:
   - We know from the problem that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's current age**:
   - The problem states that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
- Harriet is half the age of Zack.
- Harriet is 21 years old now.

Step 1: Find Adrian's age.
Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age
Adrian's age = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's age.
Harriet's age = 21 years
Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age
Zack's age = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Calculate the total age of the three people.
Total ag...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their ages in three years. Finally, we will find the average age of the three individuals in three years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Harriet's Current Age:**
   - We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

2. **Determine Adrian's Current Age:**
   - Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet.
   - Therefore, Adrian's age = 3 × Harr...

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

Given:
- Harriet is 21 years old now
- Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age
- Harriet's age is half of Zack's age
- We need to find the average age in 3 years

Step 1: Find Adrian's current age
* Adrian = 3 × Harriet
* Adrian = 3 × 21 = 63 years old

Step 2: Find Zack's current age
* Harriet = ½ × Zack
* Therefore, Zack = 2 × Harriet
* Zack = 2 × 21 = 42 years old

Step 3: Add 3 years to each person's age
* Har...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out the current ages of Adrian and Zack.

Given that Harriet is 21 years old and Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, Adrian is 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 years old.

Also, since Harriet is half the age of Zack, Zack is 2 * 21 = <<2*21=42>>42 years old.

Now, in three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = <<21+3=24>>24 years old.
Adrian will be 63 + 3 = <<63+3=66>>66 years old.
Zack will be 42 + 3 = <<42+3=45>>45 years old.

The total age of the th...
