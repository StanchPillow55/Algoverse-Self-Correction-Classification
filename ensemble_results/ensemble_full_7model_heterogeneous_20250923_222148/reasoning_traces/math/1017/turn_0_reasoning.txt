=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia uploaded in total and how they are distributed among the different types of albums.

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums**: She organized these pictures into 8 albums.

3. **Distribution of Albums**:
   - 3 of the albums are dedicated to selfies.
   - 2 of the albums are dedicated to portraits.
   - The remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3 albums) are not specified in the problem, so we will assume they contain other types of pictures.

4. **Calculating Pictures per Album**: Since Olivia put the same number of pictures into each of the 8 albums, we can calculate the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

5. **Calculating Total Selfies and Portraits**:
   - Since there are 3 albums for selfies, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   \text{Total selfies} = \text{Pictures per album} \times \text{Number of selfie albums} = 9 \times 3 = 27
   \]
   - Since there are 2 albums for portraits, the total number of portraits is:
   \[
   \text{Total portraits} = \text{Pictures per album} \times \text{Number of portrait albums} = 9 \times 2 = 18
   \]

6. **Summary of Results**:
   - Total selfies: 27
   - Total portraits: 18

7. **Final Answer**: 
   - Olivia has **27 selfies** and **18 portraits**.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Selfies: 27**
- **Portraits: 18**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put in each album. Since she put the same number of pictures in each of the 8 albums, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:

72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album

Now that we know there are 9 pictures in each album, we can find out how many selfies and portraits she had. 

For the selfies, we multiply the number of selfie albums by the number of pictures in each album:

3 selfie albums ...
