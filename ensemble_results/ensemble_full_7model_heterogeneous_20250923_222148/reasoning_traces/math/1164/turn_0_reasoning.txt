=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will first determine how many eggs were hidden, then calculate how many eggs each person found, and finally subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden.

1. **Determine the total number of eggs hidden:**
   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculate how many eggs each person found:**
   - **Lamar finds 5 eggs.**
   - **Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:**
     \[
     \text{Stacy's eggs} = 2 \times \text{Lamar's eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - **Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:**
     \[
     \text{Charlie's eggs} = \text{Stacy's eggs} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - **Mei finds half as many as Charlie:**
     \[
     \text{Mei's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Charlie's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs found:**
   Now we add up the eggs found by each person:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = \text{Lamar's eggs} + \text{Stacy's eggs} + \text{Charlie's eggs} + \text{Mei's eggs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Determine how many eggs are still hidden:**
   We subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = \text{Total eggs hidden} - \text{Total eggs found}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]

   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}

--- Model 2 Response ---
Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Cole hid 3 dozen eggs in the yard.
- Lamar finds 5 eggs.
- Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar.
- Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy.
- Mei finds half as many as Charlie.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Stacy found.
Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so:
Stacy's eggs = 2 × Lamar's eggs
Stacy's eggs = 2 × 5 = 10 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Charlie found.
Charlie f...

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs each person finds and then subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden.

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs hidden:**
   - Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, 3 dozen eggs is:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
     \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's find the total number of eggs Cole hid
* 3 dozen = 3 × 12 = 36 eggs total

2. Let's track how many eggs each person found:
* Lamar found 5 eggs
* Stacy found twice as many as Lamar
  * Stacy = 5 × 2 = 10 eggs
* Charlie found 2 less than Stacy
  * Charlie = 10 - 2 = 8 eggs
* Mei found half as many as Charlie
  * Mei = 8 ÷ 2 = 4 eggs

3. Calculate total eggs found by adding everyone's eggs:
* Total fou...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, let's convert the number of eggs from dozens to individual eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, 3 dozen eggs would be 3*12 = 36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, which means she finds 2*5 = <<2*5=10>>10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, which means he finds 10-2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, which means she finds 8/2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to subtract the number...
