Final Answer: To find out how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we can break the problem down into steps:

1. **Determine the monthly cost of car washes**: 
   Tom gets 4 car washes each month, and each car wash costs $15. 
   We can calculate the monthly cost by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per wash:

   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = \text{Number of Car Washes} \times \text{Cost per Car Wash}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Cost} = 4 \times 15 = 60
   \]

   So, Tom pays $60 each month for car washes.

2. **Calculate the annual cost**:
   Since there are 12 months in a year, we can find the total annual cost by multiplying the monthly cost by the number of months in a year:

   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{Monthly Cost} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 60 \times 12 = 720
   \]

Thus, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

**Final Answer**: Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to calculate how much Tom pays for car washes each month. Since each car wash costs $15 and he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply the cost of each car wash by the number of car washes he gets each month.

$15 * 4 = $60

So, Tom pays $60 for car washes each month.

Next, we need to calculate how much he pays in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the amount he pays each month by the number of months in a year.

$60 * 12 = $720

So, T...
