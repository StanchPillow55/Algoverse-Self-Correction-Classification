=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of cookies made by Suzanne**: 
   According to the problem, Suzanne made 36 cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies made by Josh**: 
   The problem states that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. We can calculate the number of cookies Josh made using the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Cookies made by Suzanne}
   \]
   Substituting the number of cookies made by Suzanne:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Josh} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of cookies made by Kelsie**: 
   The problem states that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. This means we need to calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times \text{Cookies made by Josh}
   \]
   Substituting the number of cookies made by Josh:
   \[
   \text{Cookies made by Kelsie} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Kelsie made 18 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies each person made, starting with the information given about Suzanne, and then using that to find out how many cookies Kelsie made.

1. **Determine how many cookies Josh made:**

   We know from the problem statement that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Suzanne made 36 cookies.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. Let's start with what we know:
* Suzanne made 36 cookies
* Josh made 1/4 of what Suzanne made
* Kelsie made 2 times more than Josh

2. First, let's find how many cookies Josh made:
* Josh = 1/4 × Suzanne's cookies
* Josh = 1/4 × 36
* Josh = 9 cookies

3. Now we can find Kelsie's cookies:
* Kelsie = 2 × Josh's cookies
* Kelsie = 2 × 9
* Kelsie = 18 cookies

Final Answer: Kelsie made 18 cookies.

The logic flow was...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): Let's start by finding out how many cookies Josh made. We know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made by dividing 36 by 4.

36 ÷ 4 = 9

So, Josh made 9 cookies.

We also know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. We can find out how many cookies Kelsie made by multiplying the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 × 2 = 18

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies.
