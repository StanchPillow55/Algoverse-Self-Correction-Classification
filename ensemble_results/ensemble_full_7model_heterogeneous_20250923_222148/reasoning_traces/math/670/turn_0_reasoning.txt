=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how much candy Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have in total and then divide that total equally among the three of them.

1. **Calculate the total amount of candy:**
   - Robert has 3 pounds of candy.
   - Cindy has 5 pounds of candy.
   - Aaron has 4 pounds of candy.

   We can find the total amount of candy by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total candy} = \text{Robert's candy} + \text{Cindy's candy} + \text{Aaron's candy}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total candy} = 3 \text{ pounds} + 5 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   Now, let's perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add Robert's and Cindy's candy:
     \[
     3 + 5 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   - Next, add Aaron's candy to this total:
     \[
     8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   So, the total amount of candy they have together is **12 pounds**.

2. **Divide the total amount of candy equally among the three of them:**
   To find out how much candy each person would get, we divide the total amount of candy by the number of people sharing it:

   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = \frac{\text{Total candy}}{\text{Number of people}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = \frac{12 \text{ pounds}}{3}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:

   \[
   \text{Candy per person} = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Each person (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron) would end up with **4 pounds of candy** after pooling and sharing their candy equally.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each person would have 4 pounds of candy.**

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how much candy they have in total. We do this by adding together the amount of candy each person has. 

Robert has 3 pounds of candy, Cindy has 5 pounds, and Aaron has 4 pounds. 

So, the total amount of candy is 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds.

They want to share this candy equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), we divide the total amount of candy by 3.

So, 12 pounds รท 3 = 4 pounds.
