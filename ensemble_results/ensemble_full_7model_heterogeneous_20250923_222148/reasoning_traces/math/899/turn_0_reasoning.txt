=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies each of Susan's 6 nephews will receive after her husband takes 4 cookies for himself.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies after her husband takes some.**

Susan originally made 100 cookies. However, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. We need to subtract the 4 cookies from the total:

\[
100 - 4 = 96
\]

So, after her husband takes his cookies, there are 96 cookies left.

**Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies among the nephews.**

Now, we need to divide the 96 cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. To do this, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{96}{6}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the result of the division.**

Now we calculate \( \frac{96}{6} \):

\[
96 \div 6 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Each nephew gets } 16 \text{ cookies.}
\]

Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies her husband took from the total number of cookies Susan made:

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

Next, we need to divide the remaining cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. We do this by dividing the number of remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies รท 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

So, each of Susan's nephews will ge...
