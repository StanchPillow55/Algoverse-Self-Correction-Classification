=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we will first calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Erasers**:
   - The cost of one eraser is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost of 6 erasers can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 6 erasers} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Pencils**:
   - The cost of one pencil is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost of 8 pencils can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of 8 pencils} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now, we will add the cost of the erasers and the cost of the pencils to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of 6 erasers} + \text{Cost of 8 pencils}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for 6 erasers and 8 pencils is **$36**.

Final answer: **$36**.

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The cost of an eraser is $2.
- The cost of a pencil is $3.
- We need to find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 6 erasers.
Cost of 1 eraser = $2
Cost of 6 erasers = 6 × $2 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 pencils.
Cost of 1 pencil = $3
Cost of 8 pencils = 8 × $3 = $24

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.
Total c...

--- Model 3 Response ---
Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve the problem of finding the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the cost of one eraser and one pencil:**
   - The cost of one eraser is $2.
   - The cost of one pencil is $3.

2. **Calculate the total cost of 6 erasers:**
   - Since each eraser costs $2, the cost for 6 erasers is calculated by multiplying the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers:
   \[
   \text{Cost of 6 erasers} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

--- Model 4 Response ---
Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* Each eraser costs $2
* Each pencil costs $3
* We need 6 erasers and 8 pencils

2. Calculate cost of erasers:
* Cost of erasers = Number of erasers × Cost per eraser
* Cost of erasers = 6 × $2
* Cost of erasers = $12

3. Calculate cost of pencils:
* Cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Cost per pencil
* Cost of pencils = 8 × $3
* Cost of pencils = $24

4. Calculate total cost...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find the total cost of the erasers. To do this, we multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers. 

The cost of one eraser is $2 and we have 6 erasers. So, the total cost of the erasers is 2*6 = $12.

Next, we need to find the total cost of the pencils. To do this, we multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils.

The cost of one pencil is $3 and we have 8 pencils. So, the total cost of the pencils is 3*8 = $24.

Finally, to find t...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * An eraser costs $2.
   * A pencil costs $3.
   * We need to find the total cost of 6 erasers and 8 pencils.

2. Calculate the cost of 6 erasers:
   * Cost of 1 eraser = $2
   * Cost of 6 erasers = 6 × $2 = $12

3. Calculate the cost of 8 pencils:
   * Cost of 1 pencil = $3
   * Cost of 8 pencils = 8 × $3 = $24

4. Sum up the total cost:
   * Total cost = Cost of 6 eras...
