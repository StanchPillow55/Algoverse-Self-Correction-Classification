=== ENSEMBLE RESPONSE ===
Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many jigsaw pieces are left after Poppy and her mom have placed some pieces on the board.

1. **Total number of pieces**: Poppy has a total of 1000 pieces in the jigsaw puzzle.

2. **Pieces placed by Poppy**: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by Poppy} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]

3. **Remaining pieces after Poppy's placement**: After Poppy places 250 pieces, we need to find out how many pieces are left. We subtract the number of pieces placed by Poppy from the total number of pieces:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750
   \]

4. **Pieces placed by Poppy's mom**: Next, Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces. We first calculate how many pieces that is:
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
   \]

5. **Remaining pieces after mom's placement**: Now we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy's mom places 250 pieces. We subtract the number of pieces placed by her mom from the remaining pieces:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500
   \]

6. **Final answer**: The number of jigsaw pieces left to be placed is:
   \[
   \boxed{500}
   \]

Model 2 (anthropic:claude-3-haiku-20240307): To solve this problem, we need to find the number of jigsaw pieces that have been placed on the board and then subtract it from the total number of pieces to find the remaining pieces.

Given information:
- The jigsaw puzzle has 1000 pieces.
- Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board.
- Poppy's mom places a third of the remaining pieces.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces Poppy placed on the board.

Model 3 (openai:gpt-4o): To solve this problem, we need to determine how many jigsaw pieces are left to be placed after Poppy and her mom have placed some pieces on the board.

1. **Total Pieces in the Puzzle:**
   The total number of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle is 1000.

2. **Poppy's Contribution:**
   Poppy places a quarter of the pieces on the board. To find out how many pieces she places, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
   \]
   So, Poppy places 250 pieces.

Model 4 (anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022): Let me solve this step by step.

1. First, let's identify what we know:
* The puzzle has 1000 pieces total
* Poppy places 1/4 (a quarter) of the pieces first
* Her mom places 1/3 of what's left after Poppy

2. Calculate how many pieces Poppy placed:
* 1/4 of 1000 = 1000 × (1/4) = 250 pieces
* Poppy placed 250 pieces

3. Calculate how many pieces remain after Poppy:
* Remaining pieces = Total pieces - Poppy's pieces
* Remaining pieces = 1000 - 250 =...

--- Model 6 Response ---
Model 6 (openai:gpt-4): First, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy placed on the board. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of pieces by 4.

1000 / 4 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy placed 250 pieces on the board.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces are left after Poppy placed her pieces. We can do this by subtracting the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces.

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

So, there are 750 pieces ...

Model 7 (anthropic:claude-3-opus-20240229): Okay, let's approach this problem step by step:

1. Understand the given information:
   * The jigsaw puzzle has 1000 pieces in total.
   * Poppy places a quarter (1/4) of the pieces on the board.
   * Poppy's mom places a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.

2. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy placed:
   * Poppy placed 1/4 of the total pieces.
   * Number of pieces Poppy placed = 1/4 × 1000
   * Number of pieces Poppy placed = 250 pieces

3. Calc...
