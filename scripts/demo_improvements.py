To solve this problem, I need to calculate step by step:

First, let me understand what we know:
- Natalia sold 48 clips in April
- She sold half as many in May as in April

Step 1: Calculate May sales
May sales = April sales √∑ 2 = 48 √∑ 2 = 24 clips

Step 2: Calculate total sales
Total = April + May = 48 + 24 = 72 clips

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether.

Final answer: 72

Looking at this problem, I need to return the absolute value of a number.
