# Teacher/Evaluator Bot: Complete System Overview

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The teacher/evaluator bot is a **comprehensive multi-turn self-correction system** that analyzes learner responses, detects cognitive biases, and provides targeted coaching feedback across 4 different dataset types. The system now supports **scaling laws research** with multi-turn enabled for ALL datasets, including HumanEval code generation.

## 🧠 Core Teacher/Evaluator Pipeline

### **3-Stage Process for Every Response**

1. **🔍 Answer Evaluation** → Dataset-specific scoring (exact match, code execution, tool usage)
2. **🎭 Bias Detection** → Heuristic analysis of cognitive biases in reasoning  
3. **💬 Coaching Generation** → Template selection and actionable feedback delivery

### **Universal Bias Detection Algorithm**

```python
def detect_bias(question: str, answer: str, reference: str, history: List) -> Tuple[str, float]:
    if answer == reference:
        return "None", 0.95  # Correct = No bias
    
    # Pattern-based bias detection:
    if answer in extract_numbers(question):
        return "Anchoring", 0.7  # Using numbers from question
    
    if contains_bandwagon_language(answer):
        return "Availability/Bandwagon", 0.7  # Following common patterns
    
    if contains_hindsight_markers(answer):  
        return "Hindsight", 0.65  # Rationalizing after the fact
    
    if contains_overgeneralization(answer):
        return "Overgeneralization", 0.65  # Broad absolute statements
    
    return "Confirmation", 0.6  # Default: Sticking with first guess
```

## 📊 Dataset-Specific Behaviors

### **🧮 GSM8K / College Math**

**Input Example**:
> "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats 3 for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 4. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per egg. How much does she make every day?"

**Teacher Analysis Process**:
1. **Extract Answer**: `"18"` from full reasoning trace
2. **Score**: `gsm8k_em("18", "18") = 1` (exact match)
3. **Detect Bias**: `answer == reference → ("None", 0.95)`
4. **Generate Feedback**: "Your reasoning is sound and your answer is correct."

**Multi-turn Scenario** (if wrong):
- **Wrong Answer**: `"16"` (anchored to eggs per day)
- **Bias Detection**: `"16" in ["16", "3", "4", "2"] → ("Anchoring", 0.7)`  
- **Template Selection**: `Anchoring + High confidence → "counter_anchor_v1"`
- **Coaching**: "Ignore any numbers or hints seen earlier. Re-derive from first principles, then compute. Show steps."

### **💻 HumanEval / Code Generation**

**Input Example**:
```python
def has_close_elements(numbers: List[float], threshold: float) -> bool:
    """ Check if in given list of numbers, are any two numbers closer to each other than
    given threshold. """
```

**Teacher Analysis Process**:
1. **Extract Code**: Function definition from reasoning trace
2. **Execute Tests**: Sandboxed execution against test suite
3. **Score**: `score_result['passed'] → 1 or 0`
4. **Detect Bias**: Limited effectiveness (code vs. text patterns)

**Multi-turn Code Improvement** (NEW):
- **Failed Tests**: `execution_result['passed'] = False`
- **Bias Detection**: `("Confirmation", 0.6)` (default fallback)
- **Template Selection**: `"devils_advocate_v1"`
- **Coaching**: "List at least one disconfirming hypothesis and test it. If it falsifies your answer, revise."

**Code Execution Details**:
```json
{
  "passed": true,
  "passed_count": 7,
  "total_count": 7,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "",
  "runtime_ms": 23.4,
  "error": "",
  "extracted_function": "def has_close_elements(numbers, threshold):..."
}
```

### **🔧 ToolQA / Tool Reasoning**

**Input Example**:
> "What is the population of the capital city of France?"

**Teacher Analysis Process**:
1. **Extract Answer**: `"2161000"` from tool-assisted reasoning
2. **Score**: `exact_match("2161000", "2161000") = 1`
3. **Tool Analysis**: Extract tools used (`["location", "population"]`)
4. **Tool Accuracy**: Calculate success rate of tool usage

**Enhanced Output**:
```json
{
  "tools_used": ["location", "population"],
  "tool_accuracy": 0.95,
  "teacher_bias": "None"
}
```

### **🎯 SuperGLUE / Multi-task Reasoning**

**Input Examples**:
- **BoolQ**: "Is the following statement true or false: The Great Wall of China is visible from space?"
- **COPA**: "The woman felt dizzy. What was the CAUSE of this? (A) She stood up quickly (B) She ate breakfast"

**Teacher Analysis Process**:
1. **Task Detection**: BoolQ, COPA, RTE, WiC, WSC, CB, MultiRC
2. **Extract Answer**: Task-specific answer format
3. **Score**: Exact match by task type
4. **Enhanced Output**: Include task type classification

## 🔄 Multi-turn Self-Correction Flow

### **Universal Decision Tree**:

```
Turn 0: Initial Response
    ↓
Evaluate Accuracy (dataset-specific)
    ↓
Detect Cognitive Bias (universal algorithm)
    ↓
Is Correct? → YES: Stop, log "None" bias
    ↓ NO
Select Template (bias + confidence)
    ↓
Generate Coaching Feedback
    ↓
Send Template + Feedback to Learner
    ↓
Turn 1: Revised Response
    ↓
Re-evaluate and Repeat (max 3 turns)
```

### **Template Selection Matrix**:

| Bias | Confidence | Template | Coaching Text |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Anchoring** | High | `counter_anchor_v1` | "Ignore any numbers or hints seen earlier..." |
| **Confirmation** | Mid/High | `devils_advocate_v1` | "List at least one disconfirming hypothesis..." |
| **Availability/Bandwagon** | Mid | `evidence_only_v1` | "Do not rely on popularity or priors..." |
| **Hindsight** | Any | `recompute_no_story_v1` | "Do not explain yet. First recompute step-by-step..." |
| **Overgeneralization** | Low/Mid | `quantify_uncertainty_v1` | "Answer only what follows from given information..." |

## 🎯 Key Scaling Study Insights

### **Expected Teacher/Evaluator Behavior Patterns**:

1. **Small Models (1-7B)**: 
   - Higher bias detection rates (more errors)
   - More "Confirmation" and "Anchoring" labels
   - Lower confidence scores
   - More multi-turn iterations needed

2. **Medium Models (8-70B)**:
   - Balanced bias detection
   - Better template response quality  
   - Moderate confidence scores
   - Optimal self-correction gains

3. **Large Models (100B+)**:
   - Fewer bias detections (more correct answers)
   - Higher "None" bias labels
   - Higher confidence scores
   - Diminishing multi-turn benefits

### **Task-Specific Scaling Expectations**:

| Dataset | Expected Bias Patterns | Multi-turn Effectiveness | Scaling Strength |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **GSM8K** | Anchoring (number focus) | High (iterative improvement) | Strongest (α≈0.35) |
| **SuperGLUE** | Confirmation (reasoning) | Moderate (logical refinement) | Strong (α≈0.30) |
| **ToolQA** | Availability (tool selection) | Moderate (tool switching) | Moderate (α≈0.25) |
| **HumanEval** | Confirmation (code structure) | Lower (architectural changes) | Weaker (α≈0.20) |
