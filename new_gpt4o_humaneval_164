Here's the thought process and approach to solving this problem:\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Input Understanding**: \n   - We are given a string that contains multiple groups of parentheses, separated by spaces.\n   - Each group is a valid sequence of parentheses.\n\n2. **Output Requirement**:\n   - For each group, we need to determine the deepest level of nested parentheses.\n   - The output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the maximum depth of nesting for the corresponding group.\n\n3. **Example Analysis**:\n   - For the input `(()()) ((())) () ((())()())`, the output should be `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.\n     - `(()())` has a maximum depth of 2.\n     - `((()))` has a maximum depth of 3.\n     - `()` has a maximum depth of 1.\n     - `((())()())` has a maximum depth of 3.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Split the Input**:\n   - Use the `split()` method to divide the input string into individual groups based on spaces.\n\n2. **Calculate Depth for Each Group**:\n   - Initialize a variable `current_depth` to track the current level of nesting as we iterate through each character in a group.\n   - Initialize a variable `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth encountered in the current group.\n   - Iterate through each character in the group:\n     - If the character is `'('`, increment `current_depth`.\n     - If the character is `')'`, decrement `current_depth`.\n     - Update `max_depth` to be the maximum of `max_depth` and `current_depth`.\n   - After processing a group, append `max_depth` to the results list.\n\n3. **Return the Results**:\n   - Return the list of maximum depths for each group.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    # Split the input string into groups based on spaces\n    groups = paren_string.split()\n    \n    # List to store the maximum depth for each group\n    max_depths = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each group\n    for group in groups:\n        current_depth = 0\n        max_depth = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each character in the group\n        for char in group:\n            if char == '(':\n                current_depth += 1\n                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)\n            elif char == ')':\n                current_depth -= 1\n        \n        # Append the maximum depth of this group to the result list\n        max_depths.append(max_depth)\n    \n    return max_depths\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())'))  # Output: [2, 3, 1, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Splitting**: We use `split()` to divide the input string into groups.\n- **Depth Calculation**: For each group, we maintain a `current_depth` to track the nesting level and update `max_depth` whenever `current_depth` exceeds it.\n- **Result Compilation**: After processing each group, we append the `max_depth` to our results list.\n- **Output**: Finally, we return the list of maximum depths for all groups.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the required depths by iterating through each character of each group only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of characters in the input string.",

Our task is to filter this list and return a new list that contains only the integer values.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input and Output**:\n   - **Input**: A list of values of any type (`List[Any]`).\n   - **Output**: A list containing only the integer values from the input list (`List[int]`).\n\n2. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - We need to iterate over each element in the input list.\n   - For each element, we need to check if it is an integer.\n\n3. **Type Checking**:\n   - In Python, we can use the `isinstance()` function to check if a value is of a specific type.\n   - Specifically, `isinstance(value, int)` will return `True` if `value` is an integer.\n\n4. **Filter Integers**:\n   - As we iterate over the list, we will collect all elements that are integers into a new list.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, we return the list containing only integers.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function `filter_integers` based on the above approach.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\ndef filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Filter given list of any python values only for integers \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store integers\n    integer_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for value in values:\n        # Check if the current element is an integer\n        if isinstance(value, int):\n            # If it is an integer, add it to the integer_list\n            integer_list.append(value)\n    \n    # Return the list of integers\n    return integer_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5]))  # Output: [5]\n# print(filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We start by initializing an empty list `integer_list` to store the integers we find.\n- We then loop through each element in the input list `values`.\n- For each element, we use `isinstance(value, int)` to check if it is an integer.\n- If the check is true, we append the element to `integer_list`.\n- Finally, we return `integer_list`, which contains only the integers from the original list.\n\nThis solution efficiently filters the list and meets the requirements of the problem statement.",

Our task is to filter this list and return a new list that contains only the integer values.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Input and Output**:\n   - **Input**: A list of values of any type (`List[Any]`).\n   - **Output**: A list containing only the integer values from the input list (`List[int]`).\n\n2. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - We need to iterate over each element in the input list.\n   - For each element, we need to check if it is an integer.\n\n3. **Type Checking**:\n   - In Python, we can use the `isinstance()` function to check if a value is of a specific type.\n   - Specifically, `isinstance(value, int)` will return `True` if `value` is an integer.\n\n4. **Filter Integers**:\n   - As we iterate over the list, we will collect all elements that are integers into a new list.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - After processing all elements, we return the list containing only integers.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function `filter_integers` based on the above approach.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Any\n\ndef filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" Filter given list of any python values only for integers \"\"\"\n    # Initialize an empty list to store integers\n    integer_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each element in the input list\n    for value in values:\n        # Check if the current element is an integer\n        if isinstance(value, int):\n            # If it is an integer, add it to the integer_list\n            integer_list.append(value)\n    \n    # Return the list of integers\n    return integer_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(filter_integers(['a', 3.14, 5]))  # Output: [5]\n# print(filter_integers([1, 2, 3, 'abc', {}, []]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We start by initializing an empty list `integer_list` to store the integers we find.\n- We then loop through each element in the input list `values`.\n- For each element, we use `isinstance(value, int)` to check if it is an integer.\n- If the check is true, we append the element to `integer_list`.\n- Finally, we return `integer_list`, which contains only the integers from the original list.\n\nThis solution efficiently filters the list and meets the requirements of the problem statement.",

This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the elements from the list and the values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Filter Elements**: Once we have the counts, we can iterate through the original list and construct a new list by including only those elements that have a count of exactly one.\n\n3. **Maintain Order**: Since we iterate through the original list to construct the new list, the order of elements that appear exactly once will be preserved.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the solution based on the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\" From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.\n    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each number\n    counts = Counter(numbers)\n    \n    # Step 2: Filter numbers that occur exactly once\n    result = [num for num in numbers if counts[num] == 1]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output should be [1, 3, 4]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Counter**: We use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the list. This gives us a dictionary-like object where each key is a number from the list, and its value is the count of that number.\n\n- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over the original list and construct a new list containing only those elements that have a count of exactly one (`counts[num] == 1`).\n\n- **Order Preservation**: Since we iterate over the original list to construct the new list, the order of elements that appear exactly once is preserved.\n\nThis solution efficiently removes duplicates and maintains the order of the remaining elements, satisfying the problem's requirements.",

Our task is to return a new list that contains only those strings from the input list that start with the given prefix.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Input and Output**:\n   - **Input**: A list of strings (`strings`) and a string (`prefix`).\n   - **Output**: A list of strings that start with the given prefix.\n\n2. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.\n   - If the prefix is an empty string, technically every string starts with an empty prefix, so the output should be the same as the input list.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - We will iterate over each string in the input list.\n   - For each string, we will check if it starts with the given prefix using the `str.startswith()` method.\n   - If a string starts with the prefix, we will include it in the result list.\n   - Finally, we will return the result list.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**:\n   - We can use a list comprehension to filter the strings efficiently.\n   - The `str.startswith()` method is perfect for this task as it checks if a string starts with the specified prefix.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\" Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.\n    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')\n    []\n    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')\n    ['abc', 'array']\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use list comprehension to filter strings that start with the given prefix\n    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a'))  # Output: ['abc', 'array']\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **List Comprehension**: We use `[s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]` to create a new list. This expression iterates over each string `s` in the `strings` list and includes it in the new list if `s.startswith(prefix)` evaluates to `True`.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution is efficient as it processes each string once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of strings in the input list.\n\nThis implementation is concise, leverages Python's built-in string methods, and handles edge cases effectively.",

Python provides a built-in `sorted()` function that can sort any iterable and return a new sorted list.\n\n3. **Return the Result**:\n   - Finally, we return the sorted list of unique elements.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function based on the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef unique(l: list):\n    \"\"\"Return sorted unique elements in a list\n    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Convert the list to a set to get unique elements\n    unique_elements = set(l)\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort the unique elements\n    sorted_unique_elements = sorted(unique_elements)\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the sorted list of unique elements\n    return sorted_unique_elements\n\n# Example usage\nprint(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Conversion to Set**: `set(l)` takes the list `l` and removes any duplicate elements, resulting in a set of unique elements.\n- **Sorting**: `sorted(unique_elements)` takes the set of unique elements and returns a new list that is sorted in ascending order.\n- **Return**: The sorted list of unique elements is returned as the final result.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in data structures and functions to achieve the desired outcome.",

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem of finding three distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we need to consider a few key points:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if there are any three distinct numbers in the list whose sum is zero. If such a triplet exists, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.\n\n2. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:\n   - If the list has fewer than three elements, it's impossible to find such a triplet, so we should return `False`.\n   - The elements must be distinct, meaning the same element cannot be used more than once in forming the triplet.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - A brute-force approach would involve checking all possible triplets in the list.

The function should work for any list of integers, including an empty list.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Input and Output**: \n   - Input: A list of integers, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n   - Output: A new list of integers where each element is incremented by 1, e.g., `[2, 3, 4]`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the List**:\n   - We need to iterate over each element in the input list.\n   - For each element, add 1 to it.\n\n3. **Create a New List**:\n   - As we iterate and increment each element, we should store the result in a new list.\n   - This ensures that the original list remains unchanged, which is a good practice unless explicitly required to modify the input.\n\n4. **Return the New List**:\n   - After processing all elements, return the new list with incremented values.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n- We can use a list comprehension in Python to achieve this in a concise and efficient manner.\n- List comprehensions are ideal for transforming lists because they are both readable and performant.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's how we can implement the `incr_list` function:\n\n```python\ndef incr_list(l: list) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Return list with elements incremented by 1.\n    \n    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])\n    [2, 3, 4]\n    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])\n    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use a list comprehension to create a new list with each element incremented by 1\n    return [x + 1 for x in l]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\nprint(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **List Comprehension**: `[x + 1 for x in l]` iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`, adds 1 to it, and collects the result in a new list.\n- **Return Statement**: The function returns the newly created list with incremented values.\n\nThis solution is efficient and leverages Python's powerful list comprehensions to achieve the desired transformation in a single, readable line of code.",

If the result is negative (which can happen when subtracting 5), add 26 to ensure it stays within the bounds of the alphabet.\n3. **Convert Back to Character**: Convert the normalized value back to a character by adding the ASCII value of 'a' and using `chr()`.\n\nLet's implement the `decode_shift` function:\n\n```python\ndef decode_shift(s: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.\n    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.\n    \"\"\"\n    return \"\".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord(\"a\")) % 26) + ord(\"a\")) for ch in s])\n\n# Example usage:\nencoded = encode_shift(\"hello\")\ndecoded = decode_shift(encoded)\nprint(f\"Encoded: {encoded}, Decoded: {decoded}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the `decode_shift` Function\n\n- **`ord(ch) - 5`**: This reverses the shift applied during encoding.\n- **`% 26`**: Ensures that the result wraps around correctly if it goes below 'a'.\n- **`+ ord(\"a\")`**: Converts the 0-based index back to the correct ASCII value for the character.\n\nThis function will correctly decode any string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function, assuming the input string contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.",

Vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Identify Vowels**: We need to identify both lowercase and uppercase vowels.

If it is a vowel, skip it.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, join the list of characters into a string and return it.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function following the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup\n    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store non-vowel characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input text\n    for char in text:\n        # If the character is not a vowel, add it to the result list\n        if char not in vowels:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(remove_vowels(''))  # Output: ''\nprint(remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\"))  # Output: 'bcdf\\nghjklm'\nprint(remove_vowels('abcdef'))  # Output: 'bcdf'\nprint(remove_vowels('aaaaa'))  # Output: ''\nprint(remove_vowels('aaBAA'))  # Output: 'B'\nprint(remove_vowels('zbcd'))  # Output: 'zbcd'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Vowel Set**: We use a set `vowels` containing all vowels for quick membership testing. Sets provide average O(1) time complexity for membership checks, making our solution efficient.\n\n- **Result List**: We use a list `result` to collect non-vowel characters.

If it is a vowel, skip it.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, join the list of characters into a string and return it.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function following the above steps:\n\n```python\ndef remove_vowels(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    remove_vowels is a function that takes a string and returns a string without vowels.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a set of vowels for quick lookup\n    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store non-vowel characters\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the input text\n    for char in text:\n        # If the character is not a vowel, add it to the result list\n        if char not in vowels:\n            result.append(char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return it\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(remove_vowels(''))  # Output: ''\nprint(remove_vowels(\"abcdef\\nghijklm\"))  # Output: 'bcdf\\nghjklm'\nprint(remove_vowels('abcdef'))  # Output: 'bcdf'\nprint(remove_vowels('aaaaa'))  # Output: ''\nprint(remove_vowels('aaBAA'))  # Output: 'B'\nprint(remove_vowels('zbcd'))  # Output: 'zbcd'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Vowel Set**: We use a set `vowels` containing all vowels for quick membership testing. Sets provide average O(1) time complexity for membership checks, making our solution efficient.\n\n- **Result List**: We use a list `result` to collect non-vowel characters. Lists are mutable and allow efficient appending of elements.\n\n- **String Join**: After filtering out vowels, we use `''.join(result)` to concatenate the list of characters into a single string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently remove vowels from the input string while maintaining the order of non-vowel characters.",

A straightforward way to do this is by using set operations, which are efficient for such tasks. Specifically, the intersection of two sets will give us the common elements.\n\n2. **Ensure Uniqueness**: By converting the lists to sets, we automatically ensure that the elements are unique, as sets do not allow duplicate values.\n\n3. **Sort the Result**: After finding the common elements, we need to sort them in ascending order. This can be easily achieved using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the sorted list of common elements.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution based on this reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef common(l1: list, l2: list):\n    \"\"\"Return sorted unique common elements for two lists.\"\"\"\n    # Convert both lists to sets to find unique elements\n    set1 = set(l1)\n    set2 = set(l2)\n    \n    # Find the intersection of both sets to get common elements\n    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)\n    \n    # Sort the common elements and convert to a list\n    sorted_common_elements = sorted(common_elements)\n    \n    # Return the sorted list of common elements\n    return sorted_common_elements\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121]))  # Output: [1, 5, 653]\n# print(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2]))  # Output: [2, 3]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Set Conversion**: We convert both input lists `l1` and `l2` into sets `set1` and `set2`.

Take a string as input.\n2. Identify all uppercase characters in the string.\n3. Calculate the ASCII value of each uppercase character.\n4. Sum these ASCII values.\n5. Return the sum.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Iterate through the string**: We'll go through each character in the string to check if it's an uppercase letter.\n2. **Check for uppercase characters**: We can use Python's built-in string method `isupper()` to determine if a character is uppercase.\n3. **Calculate ASCII values**: For each uppercase character, use the `ord()` function to get its ASCII value.\n4. **Sum the ASCII values**: Accumulate the ASCII values of all uppercase characters.\n5. **Return the result**: Finally, return the accumulated sum.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If the string is empty, the sum should be 0.\n- If there are no uppercase characters, the sum should also be 0.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above plan:\n\n```python\ndef digitSum(s):\n    # Initialize a sum variable to accumulate ASCII values\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Add the ASCII value of the character to the total sum\n            total_sum += ord(char)\n    \n    # Return the total sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test cases\nprint(digitSum(\"\"))         # Expected output: 0\nprint(digitSum(\"abAB\"))     # Expected output: 131\nprint(digitSum(\"abcCd\"))    # Expected output: 67\nprint(digitSum(\"helloE\"))   # Expected output: 69\nprint(digitSum(\"woArBld\"))  # Expected output: 131\nprint(digitSum(\"aAaaaXa\"))  # Expected output: 153\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Implementation\n\n- We initialize `total_sum` to 0 to store the sum of ASCII values.\n- We loop through each character in the string `s`.\n- For each character, we check if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`.\n- If it is uppercase, we use `ord(char)` to get its ASCII value and add it to `total_sum`.\n- After processing all characters, we return `total_sum`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the desired sum by leveraging Python's string methods and built-in functions.",

Return the sum.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Iterate through the string**: We'll go through each character in the string to check if it's an uppercase letter.\n2. **Check for uppercase characters**: We can use Python's built-in string method `isupper()` to determine if a character is uppercase.\n3. **Calculate ASCII values**: For each uppercase character, use the `ord()` function to get its ASCII value.\n4. **Sum the ASCII values**: Accumulate the ASCII values of all uppercase characters.\n5. **Return the result**: Finally, return the accumulated sum.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- If the string is empty, the sum should be 0.\n- If there are no uppercase characters, the sum should also be 0.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above plan:\n\n```python\ndef digitSum(s):\n    # Initialize a sum variable to accumulate ASCII values\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # Check if the character is uppercase\n        if char.isupper():\n            # Add the ASCII value of the character to the total sum\n            total_sum += ord(char)\n    \n    # Return the total sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test cases\nprint(digitSum(\"\"))         # Expected output: 0\nprint(digitSum(\"abAB\"))     # Expected output: 131\nprint(digitSum(\"abcCd\"))    # Expected output: 67\nprint(digitSum(\"helloE\"))   # Expected output: 69\nprint(digitSum(\"woArBld\"))  # Expected output: 131\nprint(digitSum(\"aAaaaXa\"))  # Expected output: 153\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Implementation\n\n- We initialize `total_sum` to 0 to store the sum of ASCII values.\n- We loop through each character in the string `s`.\n- For each character, we check if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`.\n- If it is uppercase, we use `ord(char)` to get its ASCII value and add it to `total_sum`.\n- After processing all characters, we return `total_sum`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the desired sum by leveraging Python's string methods and built-in functions.",

Initialize it to a very large number (e.g., `float('inf')`).\n   - `smallest_index`: To keep track of the index of the smallest even number.

According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to form a triangle, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. \\(a + b > c\\)\n2. \\(a + c > b\\)\n3. \\(b + c > a\\)\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return -1.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area Using Heron's Formula\n\nIf the sides form a valid triangle, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \\(A\\) of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s \\cdot (s - a) \\cdot (s - b) \\cdot (s - c)} \\]\n\nWhere \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Round the Result\n\nFinally, we need to round the computed area to two decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function `triangle_area` based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Step 1: Validate the triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    \n    # Step 3: Round the result to 2 decimal places\n    return round(area, 2)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00\n# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Validation**: We first check if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. If not, we return -1.\n- **Heron's Formula**: We calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and then use it to compute the area.\n- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to two decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function.\n\nThis implementation efficiently checks for a valid triangle and calculates the area if possible, adhering to the problem's requirements.",

According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) to form a triangle, the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. \\(a + b > c\\)\n2. \\(a + c > b\\)\n3. \\(b + c > a\\)\n\nIf any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return -1.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area Using Heron's Formula\n\nIf the sides form a valid triangle, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \\(A\\) of a triangle with sides \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) is:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\]\n\n\\[ A = \\sqrt{s \\cdot (s - a) \\cdot (s - b) \\cdot (s - c)} \\]\n\nWhere \\(s\\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.\n\n### Step 3: Round the Result\n\nFinally, we need to round the computed area to two decimal places before returning it.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function `triangle_area` based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef triangle_area(a, b, c):\n    # Step 1: Validate the triangle\n    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:\n        return -1\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the area using Heron's formula\n    s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    \n    # Step 3: Round the result to 2 decimal places\n    return round(area, 2)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Output: 6.00\n# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Validation**: We first check if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. If not, we return -1.\n- **Heron's Formula**: We calculate the semi-perimeter \\(s\\) and then use it to compute the area.\n- **Rounding**: The area is rounded to two decimal places using Python's built-in `round` function.\n\nThis implementation efficiently checks for a valid triangle and calculates the area if possible, adhering to the problem's requirements.",

In Python, we can reverse a list using slicing: `q[::-1]`.\n   - Compare the original list `q` with its reversed version `q[::-1]`. If they are equal, the list is palindromic.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of the list:**\n   - Use the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all elements in the list `q`.\n\n3. **Compare the sum with the maximum weight:**\n   - Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to `w`.\n\n4. **Return the result:**\n   - The object will fly if both conditions are met: the list is palindromic and the sum is less than or equal to `w`.\n   - Return `True` if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef will_it_fly(q, w):\n    # Check if the list is palindromic\n    is_palindromic = (q == q[::-1])\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of the list\n    total_weight = sum(q)\n    \n    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight\n    is_within_weight_limit = (total_weight <= w)\n    \n    # The object will fly if both conditions are met\n    return is_palindromic and is_within_weight_limit\n\n# Test cases\nprint(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # \u279e False\nprint(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # \u279e False\nprint(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # \u279e True\nprint(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # \u279e True\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Test Cases:\n\n- **Test Case 1:** `[1, 2]` is not palindromic, so it returns `False`.\n- **Test Case 2:** `[3, 2, 3]` is palindromic, but the sum `8` is greater than `1`, so it returns `False`.\n- **Test Case 3:** `[3, 2, 3]` is palindromic and the sum `8` is less than `9`, so it returns `True`.\n- **Test Case 4:** `[3]` is trivially palindromic and the sum `3` is less than `5`, so it returns `True`.\n\nThis implementation correctly checks both conditions and returns the expected results.",

Here's how we can think through the problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements:**\n   - We need to check if a number `a` is the product of exactly three prime numbers.\n   - The number `a` is guaranteed to be less than 100.\n\n2. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 100:**\n   - The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\n3. **Generate All Possible Products of Three Distinct Primes:**\n   - We need to consider combinations of three distinct primes from the list above and calculate their products.\n   - Since `a` is less than 100, we only need to consider combinations where the product is less than 100.\n\n4. **Check if `a` is in the List of Products:**\n   - Once we have the list of all possible products of three distinct primes that are less than 100, we simply check if `a` is in this list.\n\n5. **Implementation:**\n   - We will use combinations from the itertools module to generate combinations of three primes.\n   - Calculate the product for each combination and store it in a set for quick lookup.\n   - Finally, check if `a` is in the set of products.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's implement the solution based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_multiply_prime(a):\n    \"\"\"Returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers and false otherwise.\"\"\"\n    # List of prime numbers less than 100\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]\n    \n    # Generate all combinations of three distinct primes\n    products_of_three_primes = set()\n    for combo in combinations(primes, 3):\n        product = combo[0] * combo[1] * combo[2]\n        if product < 100:\n            products_of_three_primes.add(product)\n    \n    # Check if the given number is in the set of products\n    return a in products_of_three_primes\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True\nprint(is_multiply_prime(60))  # Should return False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We use `combinations(primes, 3)` to generate all possible combinations of three distinct primes.\n- For each combination, we calculate the product and check if it's less than 100.

For example, \\((-2)^3 = -8\\).\n   - Therefore, we need to consider both positive and negative potential cube roots.\n\n3. **Handling Zero**:\n   - Zero is a special case where \\( 0^3 = 0 \\). Thus, zero is a perfect cube.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - We will iterate over possible integer values of `n` from negative to positive.\n   - Specifically, we will check values of `n` from \\(-\\sqrt[3]{|a|}\\) to \\(\\sqrt[3]{|a|}\\).

          "raw_answer": "To solve this problem, we need to map a list of GPA scores to their corresponding letter grades based on the given grading scale. The task involves iterating over each GPA in the input list and determining the appropriate letter grade using the provided criteria.\n\n### Step-by-Step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Grading Scale**: \n   - We have a mapping from GPA scores to letter grades. The mapping is defined by specific thresholds.

If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not a prime number.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Define a helper function `is_prime(n)` that checks if a number `n` is prime.\n   - In the `prime_length` function, calculate the length of the string.\n   - Use the `is_prime` function to determine if the length is a prime number and return the result.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to determine if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef prime_length(string):\n    \"\"\"Returns True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise.\"\"\"\n    length = len(string)\n    return is_prime(length)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(prime_length('Hello'))    # True, length is 5 (prime)\nprint(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True, length is 7 (prime)\nprint(prime_length('kittens'))  # True, length is 7 (prime)\nprint(prime_length('orange'))   # False, length is 6 (not prime)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`is_prime(n)` Function**: This function checks if `n` is a prime number. It handles small numbers directly and uses a loop to check divisibility for larger numbers, optimizing by checking up to the square root of `n`.\n- **`prime_length(string)` Function**: This function calculates the length of the input string and uses the `is_prime` function to determine if the length is prime, returning the result.\n\nThis solution efficiently checks for prime numbers and handles the problem requirements as specified.",

The order of words and spaces should remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Identify the Components:**\n   - Words are sequences of characters separated by spaces.\n   - Spaces should be preserved as they are in the input string.\n\n3. **Approach:**\n   - Split the input string into words and spaces. We can use regular expressions to split the string while keeping the delimiters (spaces).\n   - For each word, sort the characters.\n   - Reconstruct the string by combining the sorted words and spaces in their original order.\n\n4. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Use Python's `re` module to split the string while keeping the spaces.\n   - Use the `sorted()` function to sort the characters of each word.\n   - Join the sorted characters back into a word.\n   - Concatenate the sorted words and spaces to form the final result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Single word with no spaces.\n   - Multiple spaces between words.\n   - Special characters and punctuation within words.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's implement the function `anti_shuffle` based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    # Use regex to split the string into words and spaces\n    parts = re.split(r'(\\s+)', s)\n    \n    # Sort characters in each word, leave spaces unchanged\n    sorted_parts = [''.join(sorted(part)) if not part.isspace() else part for part in parts]\n    \n    # Join the sorted parts back into a single string\n    return ''.join(sorted_parts)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Expected: 'Hi'\nprint(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Expected: 'ehllo'\nprint(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Expected: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Regex Splitting:** We use `re.split(r'(\\s+)', s)` to split the string into parts, where each part is either a sequence of non-space characters (a word) or a sequence of spaces. The parentheses in the regex ensure that the spaces are included in the result.\n  \n- **Sorting Words:** We iterate over each part. If the part is not a space (`not part.isspace()`), we sort its characters using `sorted(part)` and join them back into a string using `''.join()`.

The problem specifies that the shift should be \"two multiplied to two places,\" which I interpret as shifting each letter by 4 positions forward in the alphabet (since 2 * 2 = 4).\n\nLet's break down the steps to implement this function:\n\n1. **Understand the Alphabet Rotation**: \n   - We are given that each letter should be shifted by 4 positions forward. For example, 'a' becomes 'e', 'b' becomes 'f', and so on.\n   - If the shift goes past 'z', it should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. For example, 'y' shifted by 4 becomes 'c', and 'z' becomes 'd'.\n\n2. **Handling the Wrap Around**:\n   - The alphabet has 26 letters, so if a letter's shift goes beyond 'z', we can use modulo arithmetic to wrap around. Specifically, if the position of a letter after shifting exceeds 25 (since 'a' is at position 0), we take the result modulo 26.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Iterate over each character in the input string.\n   - For each character, calculate its new position by adding 4 to its current position in the alphabet.\n   - Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around cases.\n   - Convert the new position back to a character and append it to the result string.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The function should only shift lowercase alphabetic characters. If the input contains non-alphabetic characters, we should decide whether to ignore them or raise an error. Based on the examples, it seems the input will only contain lowercase letters.\n\nNow, let's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    \"\"\"Encrypts the string by shifting each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet.\"\"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        # Find the original position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z')\n        original_position = ord(char) - ord('a')\n        \n        # Calculate the new position with a shift of 4\n        new_position = (original_position + 4) % 26\n        \n        # Convert the new position back to a character\n        new_char = chr(new_position + ord('a'))\n        \n        # Append the new character to the result\n        result.append(new_char)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encrypt('hi'))        # Expected output: 'lm'\nprint(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Expected output: 'ewhjklnop'\nprint(encrypt('gf'))        # Expected output: 'kj'\nprint(encrypt('et'))        # Expected output: 'ix'\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly shifts each letter by 4 positions, handles wrap-around using modulo arithmetic, and constructs the encrypted string by joining the list of shifted characters.",

For example, 'y' shifted by 4 becomes 'c', and 'z' becomes 'd'.\n\n2. **Handling the Wrap Around**:\n   - The alphabet has 26 letters, so if a letter's shift goes beyond 'z', we can use modulo arithmetic to wrap around. Specifically, if the position of a letter after shifting exceeds 25 (since 'a' is at position 0), we take the result modulo 26.\n\n3. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Iterate over each character in the input string.\n   - For each character, calculate its new position by adding 4 to its current position in the alphabet.\n   - Use modulo 26 to handle wrap-around cases.\n   - Convert the new position back to a character and append it to the result string.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The function should only shift lowercase alphabetic characters. If the input contains non-alphabetic characters, we should decide whether to ignore them or raise an error. Based on the examples, it seems the input will only contain lowercase letters.\n\nNow, let's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef encrypt(s):\n    \"\"\"Encrypts the string by shifting each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet.\"\"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        # Find the original position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z')\n        original_position = ord(char) - ord('a')\n        \n        # Calculate the new position with a shift of 4\n        new_position = (original_position + 4) % 26\n        \n        # Convert the new position back to a character\n        new_char = chr(new_position + ord('a'))\n        \n        # Append the new character to the result\n        result.append(new_char)\n    \n    # Join the list of characters into a single string and return\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encrypt('hi'))        # Expected output: 'lm'\nprint(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Expected output: 'ewhjklnop'\nprint(encrypt('gf'))        # Expected output: 'kj'\nprint(encrypt('et'))        # Expected output: 'ix'\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly shifts each letter by 4 positions, handles wrap-around using modulo arithmetic, and constructs the encrypted string by joining the list of shifted characters.",

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem of encoding a message by swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet, we can break down the task into a series of steps. Let's go through the thought process step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Vowels**: The vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). We need to replace each of these vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Mapping Vowels to New Characters**: \n   - 'a' -> 'c'\n   - 'e' -> 'g'\n   - 'i' -> 'k'\n   - 'o' -> 'q'\n   - 'u' -> 'w'\n   - Similarly, for uppercase vowels:\n     - 'A' -> 'C'\n     - 'E' -> 'G'\n     - 'I' -> 'K'\n     - 'O' -> 'Q'\n     - 'U' -> 'W'\n\n3. **Swap Case**: For each character in the string, if it's a letter, we need to swap its case. This means converting lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.\n\n4. **Iterate Over the Message**: We need to iterate through each character in the input message, apply the vowel transformation if it's a vowel, and swap its case.\n\n5. **Construct the Result**: As we process each character, we build the resulting encoded message.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWith the above steps in mind, we can now implement the function `encode`. Here's how we can do it:\n\n```python\ndef encode(message):\n    # Define the vowel transformation mapping\n    vowel_map = {\n        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',\n        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'\n    }\n    \n    # Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters\n    encoded_message = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each character in the message\n    for char in message:\n        # Check if the character is a vowel and needs transformation\n        if char in vowel_map:\n            # Replace the vowel with its mapped character\n            transformed_char = vowel_map[char]\n        else:\n            # If not a vowel, just swap the case\n            transformed_char = char.swapcase()\n        \n        # Append the transformed character to the result list\n        encoded_message.append(transformed_char)\n    \n    # Join the list into a string and return the encoded message\n    return ''.join(encoded_message)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'\nprint(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We use a dictionary `vowel_map` to store the mapping of vowels to their respective transformed characters.\n- We iterate over each character in the input `message`. For each character, we check if it is a vowel using the `vowel_map`. If it is, we replace it with the corresponding character from the map.\n- If the character is not a vowel, we simply swap its case using the `swapcase()` method.\n- We collect all transformed characters in a list `encoded_message` and finally join them into a single string to return the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly transform vowels and swap the case of all letters in the message.",

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem of finding all prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, we need to understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output:**\n   - Input: A non-negative integer `n`.\n   - Output: A list of prime numbers less than `n`.\n\n2. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0 or 1, the output should be an empty list because there are no prime numbers less than 2.\n   - If `n` is 2, the output should also be an empty list because the only prime number less than 2 is 2 itself, which is not less than 2.\n\n3. **Algorithm to Find Prime Numbers:**\n   - We need to check each number less than `n` to see if it is prime.\n   - A number `p` is prime if it is greater than 1 and not divisible by any number other than 1 and `p`.\n   - To check if a number `p` is prime, we can check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `p`.

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem of splitting a string of words separated by commas or spaces into an array of words, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output**:\n   - Input: A string `s` containing words separated by commas or spaces.\n   - Output: A list of words extracted from the string.\n\n2. **Identify the Delimiters**:\n   - The words in the string are separated by either commas or spaces. We need to handle both delimiters.\n\n3. **Splitting Strategy**:\n   - Python's `str.split()` method can be used to split a string based on a delimiter. However, it can only handle one delimiter at a time.\n   - To handle multiple delimiters, we can use the `re.split()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module, which allows us to specify a pattern that includes multiple delimiters.\n\n4. **Regular Expression Pattern**:\n   - We need a pattern that matches both commas and spaces. The pattern `[,\\s]+` can be used:\n     - `,` matches a comma.\n     - `\\s` matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, etc.).\n     - The `+` quantifier ensures that one or more occurrences of the delimiters are considered as a single split point.\n\n5. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Import the `re` module.\n   - Use `re.split()` with the pattern `[,\\s]+` to split the input string into words.\n   - Return the resulting list of words.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Consider strings with leading or trailing delimiters.\n   - Handle multiple consecutive delimiters.\n\nNow, let's implement the function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Splits a string into words based on commas or spaces and returns a list of words.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    s (str): The input string containing words separated by commas or spaces.\n    \n    Returns:\n    list: A list of words extracted from the input string.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use regular expression to split the string by commas or spaces\n    words = re.split(r'[,\\s]+', s.strip())\n    \n    # Return the list of words\n    return words\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(words_string(\"Hi, my name is John\"))  # Output: [\"Hi\", \"my\", \"name\", \"is\", \"John\"]\nprint(words_string(\"One, two, three, four, five, six\"))  # Output: [\"One\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\", \"six\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We use `re.split(r'[,\\s]+', s.strip())` to split the string `s`:\n  - `r'[,\\s]+'` is the regular expression pattern that matches one or more commas or whitespace characters.\n  - `s.strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string, ensuring that we don't get empty strings at the start or end of the list if the string starts or ends with delimiters.\n- The function returns the list of words obtained from the split operation.",

For example, a right shift on `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]` results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.\n\n2. **Objective**: We need to determine if there exists a number of right shift operations that will result in the array being sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n3. **Unique Elements**: The problem guarantees that all elements in the array are unique, which simplifies the problem since we don't have to deal with duplicate values.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Sorted Order**: First, determine what the sorted version of the array looks like. For example, if the array is `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, the sorted version is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n\n2. **Simulate Right Shifts**: We can simulate the effect of right shifts by considering each possible starting point in the array and checking if the array can be rotated to match the sorted version.\n\n3. **Check Rotations**: For each index `i` in the array, consider it as the starting point of the array and check if the sequence from `i` to the end followed by the sequence from the start to `i-1` matches the sorted array.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: \n   - If the array is empty, it is trivially sorted, so return `True`.\n   - If the array has only one element, it is also trivially sorted.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function `move_one_ball` based on the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return True\n    \n    n = len(arr)\n    sorted_arr = sorted(arr)\n    \n    # Check each possible rotation\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Create a rotated version of the array starting from index i\n        rotated = arr[i:] + arr[:i]\n        if rotated == sorted_arr:\n            return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True\nprint(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We first check if the array is empty, in which case we return `True`.\n- We sort the array to get the target sorted order.\n- We iterate over each index `i` and simulate the effect of starting the array from that index.\n- For each simulated rotation, we check if it matches the sorted array.\n- If any rotation matches, we return `True`.

This can be efficiently done using a list comprehension or a filter function.\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome**: After obtaining the modified string, we need to check if this string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. We can check this by comparing the string to its reverse.\n\n3. **Return Result**: Finally, we need to return a tuple containing the modified string and a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.\n\nLet's break down the steps with an example:\n\n- Suppose `s = \"abcde\"` and `c = \"ae\"`.\n  - Remove characters: We remove 'a' and 'e' from \"abcde\", resulting in \"bcd\".\n  - Check palindrome: \"bcd\" is not the same as \"dcb\", so it is not a palindrome.\n  - Return result: The result is `('bcd', False)`.\n\n- Suppose `s = \"abcdedcba\"` and `c = \"ab\"`.\n  - Remove characters: We remove 'a' and 'b', resulting in \"cdedc\".\n  - Check palindrome: \"cdedc\" is the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.\n  - Return result: The result is `('cdedc', True)`.\n\nNow, let's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_delete(s, c):\n    # Step 1: Remove characters from s that are in c\n    result_string = ''.join(char for char in s if char not in c)\n    \n    # Step 2: Check if the result string is a palindrome\n    is_palindrome = result_string == result_string[::-1]\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the result as a tuple\n    return (result_string, is_palindrome)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcde\", \"ae\"))       # Output: ('bcd', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdef\", \"b\"))       # Output: ('acdef', False)\nprint(reverse_delete(\"abcdedcba\", \"ab\"))   # Output: ('cdedc', True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Removing Characters**: We use a generator expression within `join` to iterate over each character in `s` and include it in the result only if it is not in `c`. This effectively filters out all unwanted characters.\n\n- **Checking Palindrome**: We check if the resulting string is equal to its reverse.

This will handle multiple spaces naturally.\n   - For each word, count the number of consonants.\n   - If the count of consonants in a word is equal to `n`, add the word to the result list.\n   - Return the result list.\n\n4. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Use a helper function to count consonants in a word.\n   - Iterate over each word in the split list and apply the consonant counting function.\n   - Collect words that meet the criteria into a list and return it.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef select_words(s, n):\n    \"\"\"Given a string s and a natural number n, return a list of all words from string s\n    that contain exactly n consonants, in order these words appear in the string s.\"\"\"\n    \n    def count_consonants(word):\n        vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n        consonant_count = 0\n        for char in word:\n            if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels:\n                consonant_count += 1\n        return consonant_count\n    \n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # List to store words with exactly n consonants\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each word and check consonant count\n    for word in words:\n        if count_consonants(word) == n:\n            result.append(word)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 4))  # Output: [\"little\"]\nprint(select_words(\"Mary had a little lamb\", 3))  # Output: [\"Mary\", \"lamb\"]\nprint(select_words(\"simple white space\", 2))     # Output: []\nprint(select_words(\"Hello world\", 4))            # Output: [\"world\"]\nprint(select_words(\"Uncle sam\", 3))              # Output: [\"Uncle\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Helper Function `count_consonants`:** This function iterates over each character in a word and checks if it is a consonant (i.e., an alphabetic character that is not a vowel). It uses a set for vowels for efficient membership checking.\n- **Main Function `select_words`:** This function splits the input string into words, counts the consonants in each word using the helper function, and collects words with exactly `n` consonants into a result list.\n- **Edge Cases:** The function handles empty strings by returning an empty list since splitting an empty string results in an empty list.",

If `k` is 0, return an empty list immediately since no elements are needed.\n\n2. **Extract Maximum Elements**:\n   - Use a method to extract the `k` largest elements from the array. Python provides a convenient function `heapq.nlargest` which can be used to efficiently find the `k` largest elements in an array. This function internally uses a heap data structure to maintain the largest elements, making it efficient with a time complexity of `O(n log k)`.\n\n3. **Sort the Result**:\n   - Once we have the `k` largest elements, we need to sort them in ascending order before returning. This can be done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - Return the sorted list of the `k` largest elements.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nHere's how we can implement the above logic in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef maximum(arr, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list \n    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Edge case: if k is 0, return an empty list\n    if k == 0:\n        return []\n    \n    # Use heapq.nlargest to get the k largest elements\n    k_largest = heapq.nlargest(k, arr)\n    \n    # Sort the k largest elements\n    k_largest_sorted = sorted(k_largest)\n    \n    return k_largest_sorted\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]\n# print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]\n# print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **heapq.nlargest(k, arr)**: This function efficiently finds the `k` largest elements in `arr`.

However, since the problem doesn't specify leap year handling, we will assume February can have up to 29 days.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check if the string is empty**: Return `False` if it is.\n2. **Split the string**: Use the hyphen (`-`) as a delimiter to split the string into components.\n3. **Validate the format**: Ensure that the split results in exactly three components: month, day, and year.\n4. **Convert components to integers**: Check if they are numeric and convert them to integers.\n5. **Validate the month**: Ensure the month is between 1 and 12.\n6. **Validate the day**: Check the day against the valid range for the given month.\n7. **Return the result**: If all checks pass, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the implementation of the `valid_date` function:\n\n```python\ndef valid_date(date):\n    # Check if the date string is empty\n    if not date:\n        return False\n    \n    # Split the date string by hyphen\n    parts = date.split('-')\n    \n    # Check if the date has exactly three parts\n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        return False\n    \n    # Extract month, day, and year\n    month_str, day_str, year_str = parts\n    \n    # Check if all parts are numeric\n    if not (month_str.isdigit() and day_str.isdigit() and year_str.isdigit()):\n        return False\n    \n    # Convert parts to integers\n    month = int(month_str)\n    day = int(day_str)\n    year = int(year_str)\n    \n    # Validate month\n    if month < 1 or month > 12:\n        return False\n    \n    # Validate day based on the month\n    if month in {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}:\n        if day < 1 or day > 31:\n            return False\n    elif month in {4, 6, 9, 11}:\n        if day < 1 or day > 30:\n            return False\n    elif month == 2:\n        if day < 1 or day > 29:\n            return False\n    \n    # If all checks pass, the date is valid\n    return True\n\n# Test cases\nprint(valid_date('03-11-2000'))  # True\nprint(valid_date('15-01-2012'))  # False\nprint(valid_date('04-0-2040'))   # False\nprint(valid_date('06-04-2020'))  # True\nprint(valid_date('06/04/2020'))  # False\n```\n\nThis function checks all the necessary conditions to determine if a date string is valid according to the specified rules.",

If so, the list is not sorted, and we return `False`.\n   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each number.

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we need to consider the following steps:\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is an `N x N` matrix where each cell contains a unique integer from `1` to `N*N`. This means each number appears exactly once in the grid.\n\n2. **Path Definition**: A path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells. The path can start from any cell, and you can move to any of the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) without going off the grid.\n\n3. **Lexicographical Order**: The path is considered minimal if the sequence of numbers collected from the path is lexicographically smallest. This means we need to compare paths based on the sequence of numbers they collect.\n\n4. **Constraints**: We cannot go off the grid, and the path length is exactly `k`.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Since we can start from any cell, we need to consider all possible starting points in the grid.\n\n2. **Path Exploration**: Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell.\n\n3. **Path Comparison**: As we explore paths, we keep track of the lexicographically smallest path found so far.\n\n4. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure that during exploration, we do not go off the grid.\n\n5. **Optimization**: Since the grid contains unique numbers from `1` to `N*N`, starting from the smallest number might help in quickly finding the minimal path.

If all digits are even, the function should return 0.\n\nLet's break down the problem and our approach step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to iterate through each digit of the integer `n`.\n   - We need to identify whether a digit is odd or even.\n   - If a digit is odd, we multiply it with a running product.\n   - If all digits are even, we return 0.\n\n2. **Plan:**\n   - Convert the integer `n` to a string to easily iterate over each digit.\n   - Initialize a variable `product` to 1.

For example, in the string \"[[]]\", the inner \"[]\" is nested within the outer \"[]\".\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We are given a string consisting only of square brackets: '[' and ']'.\n   - We need to determine if there is at least one nested pair of brackets.\n\n2. **Valid Nested Sequence:**\n   - A valid nested sequence means that there is at least one pair of brackets that is enclosed within another pair.\n   - For example, in \"[[]]\", the inner \"[]\" is nested within the outer \"[]\".\n\n3. **Using a Stack:**\n   - A common approach to solving problems involving nested structures is to use a stack.\n   - We can traverse the string and use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets '['.\n   - When we encounter a closing bracket ']', we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket '[' in the stack.\n   - If there is, we pop the stack, indicating that we have found a matching pair.\n   - If the stack is not empty after popping, it means there was an opening bracket before this pair, indicating a nested structure.\n\n4. **Algorithm:**\n   - Initialize an empty stack.\n   - Traverse each character in the string:\n     - If the character is '[', push it onto the stack.\n     - If the character is ']', check if the stack is not empty:\n       - If the stack is not empty, pop the stack.\n       - After popping, if the stack is still not empty, return `True` (indicating a nested structure).\n   - If we finish traversing the string without finding a nested structure, return `False`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Strings with no brackets or only one type of bracket (e.g., \"]]]]\") should return `False`.\n   - Strings with no nesting, like \"[][]\", should also return `False`.\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef is_nested(string):\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in string:\n        if char == '[':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ']':\n            if stack:\n                stack.pop()\n                # After popping, if the stack is not empty, it means there was an opening bracket\n                # before this pair, indicating a nested structure.\n                if stack:\n                    return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_nested('[[]]'))        # \u279e True\nprint(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # \u279e False\nprint(is_nested('[][]'))        # \u279e False\nprint(is_nested('[]'))          # \u279e False\nprint(is_nested('[[][]]'))      # \u279e True\nprint(is_nested('[[]][['))      # \u279e True\n```\n\nThis implementation uses a stack to track the opening brackets and checks for nested structures by ensuring that after finding a matching pair, there is still an unmatched opening bracket left in the stack. This indicates that the matched pair was nested within another pair.",

Let's break down the requirements and approach step by step:\n\n### Understanding the Problem\n\n1. **Alphabetical Character**: A character is considered alphabetical if it is a letter from A-Z or a-z.\n\n2. **Not Part of a Word**: A word is defined as a sequence of characters separated by spaces. Therefore, a character is not part of a word if it is the only character or if it is preceded by a space.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - An empty string should return `False` because there is no character to check.\n   - A string that ends with a space should return `False` because the last character is not a letter.\n   - A string where the last character is a letter but is part of a word should return `False`.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return `False`.\n\n2. **Trim Trailing Spaces**: Use the `rstrip()` method to remove any trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that the last character we check is not a space.\n\n3. **Check Last Character**:\n   - After trimming, if the string is empty, return `False`.\n   - Check if the last character is an alphabetical character using `isalpha()`.\n   - If it is alphabetical, check if it is preceded by a space or if it is the only character in the string.\n\n4. **Return Result**: Based on the checks, return `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and not part of a word, otherwise return `False`.\n\n### Implementation\n\nNow, let's implement the function based on the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):\n    # Step 1: Check for empty string\n    if not txt:\n        return False\n    \n    # Step 2: Trim trailing spaces\n    txt = txt.rstrip()\n    \n    # Step 3: Check if the string is empty after trimming\n    if not txt:\n        return False\n    \n    # Step 4: Check the last character\n    last_char = txt[-1]\n    if last_char.isalpha():\n        # Check if it's the only character or preceded by a space\n        if len(txt) == 1 or txt[-2] == ' ':\n            return True\n    \n    # Step 5: Return False if conditions are not met\n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pie\"))  # \u279e False\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e\"))  # \u279e True\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"apple pi e \"))  # \u279e False\nprint(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(\"\"))  # \u279e False\n```\n\nThis implementation follows the outlined approach and handles the edge cases effectively.

Positive even numbers start from 2, 4, 6, and so on.\n\n2. **Sum of Four Positive Even Numbers:**\n   - If we want to express \\( n \\) as the sum of four positive even numbers, we can denote these numbers as \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\), where each of these is a positive even number.\n   - Therefore, \\( n = a + b + c + d \\).\n\n3. **Properties of Even Numbers:**\n   - The sum of even numbers is always even. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be even for it to be expressed as the sum of four even numbers.\n\n4. **Minimum Sum of Four Positive Even Numbers:**\n   - The smallest positive even number is 2. Thus, the smallest sum of four positive even numbers is \\( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \\).\n   - Therefore, if \\( n < 8 \\), it is impossible to express \\( n \\) as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n\n5. **General Case:**\n   - For \\( n \\geq 8 \\) and \\( n \\) being even, it is always possible to express \\( n \\) as the sum of four positive even numbers.

This can be done using a helper function or Python's built-in `math.factorial`.\n\n4. **Multiply Factorials**: Multiply the current `k!` with the `result` to accumulate the product.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, `result` will contain the Brazilian factorial of `n`.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's implement the function `special_factorial` using the above approach:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the Brazilian factorial of n.\"\"\"\n    result = 1\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= math.factorial(k)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We import the `math` module to use the `math.factorial` function, which efficiently computes the factorial of a number.\n- We initialize `result` to 1 because multiplying by 1 does not change the product.\n- We loop over each integer `k` from 1 to `n`, calculate `k!`, and multiply it with `result`.\n- Finally, we return `result`, which contains the product of all factorials from `1!` to `n!`.\n\nThis solution is efficient for reasonably small values of `n`, as factorials grow very quickly and can lead to large numbers. For very large `n`, this approach may need optimization or handling of large integers.",

This means we need a stable sorting algorithm.\n\n3. **Implementation**: Python's built-in sorting functions are stable, so we can use them directly. We can use the `sorted()` function with a custom key that calculates the sum of digits for each number.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Define a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer. This function should handle negative numbers by taking the absolute value before summing the digits.\n\n- **Step 2**: Use the `sorted()` function with the custom key being the sum of digits calculated by our helper function. This will sort the list based on the sum of digits.\n\n- **Step 3**: Return the sorted list.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef order_by_points(nums):\n    def sum_of_digits(n):\n        # Convert the number to its absolute value and then to a string\n        # Sum the integer value of each character (digit) in the string\n        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))\n    \n    # Sort the list using the sum_of_digits as the key\n    # sorted() is stable, so it maintains the order of elements with equal keys\n    return sorted(nums, key=sum_of_digits)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Expected output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]\nprint(order_by_points([]))  # Expected output: []\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **sum_of_digits Function**: This function takes an integer `n`, converts it to its absolute value to ignore the negative sign, and then converts it to a string. It iterates over each character in the string, converts it back to an integer, and sums these integers to get the sum of digits.\n\n- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with `key=sum_of_digits`, which sorts the list based on the sum of digits of each number. Since `sorted()` is stable, it maintains the relative order of elements that have the same sum of digits.\n\nThis approach efficiently sorts the list as required by the problem statement.",

          "raw_answer": "To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We are given a positive integer `n` and need to create an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is calculated using the formula `a[i] = i * i - i + 1`. We then need to find the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` such that `i < j < k` and the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of 3.\n\n2. **Generate the Array**: First, we will generate the array `a` using the given formula. This is straightforward as we can iterate from 1 to `n` and compute each element.\n\n3. **Check for Multiples of 3**: For each possible triple `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k`, we need to check if the sum `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is divisible by 3.\n\n4. **Optimize the Search for Triples**: Instead of checking every possible combination of triples, we can use properties of numbers modulo 3. Specifically, if we know the remainder of each `a[i]` when divided by 3, we can use these remainders to determine if their sum is divisible by 3.\n\n5. **Count the Remainders**: We can count how many numbers in `a` have a remainder of 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3. Let's denote these counts as `count_0`, `count_1`, and `count_2`.\n\n6. **Calculate Valid Triples**:\n   - **All three numbers have the same remainder**: We can choose any three numbers from those with the same remainder. For example, if we have `count_0` numbers with remainder 0, the number of ways to choose 3 of them is `C(count_0, 3)`.\n   - **One number from each remainder**: We can choose one number with remainder 0, one with remainder 1, and one with remainder 2.

We need to provide a custom key to the `sorted()` function:\n   - The primary key should be the length of the string (`len(s)`).\n   - The secondary key should be the string itself for alphabetical sorting.\n3. **Return the Result**: Return the sorted list.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef sorted_list_sum(lst):\n    \"\"\"Write a function that accepts a list of strings as a parameter,\n    deletes the strings that have odd lengths from it,\n    and returns the resulted list with a sorted order,\n    The list is always a list of strings and never an array of numbers,\n    and it may contain duplicates.\n    The order of the list should be ascending by length of each word, and you\n    should return the list sorted by that rule.\n    If two words have the same length, sort the list alphabetically.\n    The function should return a list of strings in sorted order.\n    You may assume that all words will have the same length.\n    For example:\n    assert list_sort([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) => [\"aa\"]\n    assert list_sort([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) => [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Filter out strings with odd lengths\n    filtered_lst = [s for s in lst if len(s) % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort the filtered list by length and then alphabetically\n    sorted_lst = sorted(filtered_lst, key=lambda s: (len(s), s))\n    \n    # Step 3: Return the sorted list\n    return sorted_lst\n\n# Example usage and test cases\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"aa\", \"a\", \"aaa\"]) == [\"aa\"]\nassert sorted_list_sum([\"ab\", \"a\", \"aaa\", \"cd\"]) == [\"ab\", \"cd\"]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Filtering**: We use a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input list `lst` and include it in `filtered_lst` only if its length is even (`len(s) % 2 == 0`).\n- **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used with a custom key that first sorts by the length of the string and then by the string itself for alphabetical order.\n- **Return**: The function returns the sorted list `sorted_lst`.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem requirements and provides the correct output for the given examples.",

Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Rotation of a String**: A rotation involves moving characters from the start of the string to the end while maintaining their order. For example, rotations of \"abc\" are \"abc\", \"bca\", and \"cab\".\n- **Substring**: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Generate Rotations of `b`**: \n   - For a string `b` of length `n`, there are `n` possible rotations.\n   - We can generate these rotations by slicing the string and concatenating the slices.\n\n2. **Check Each Rotation**:\n   - For each rotation of `b`, check if it is a substring of `a`.\n   - If any rotation is found as a substring, return `True`.\n\n3. **Return `False` if No Rotation Matches**:\n   - If none of the rotations of `b` is a substring of `a`, return `False`.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function `cycpattern_check` based on the above approach:\n\n```python\ndef cycpattern_check(a, b):\n    # Get the length of the second word\n    len_b = len(b)\n    \n    # Generate all rotations of b\n    for i in range(len_b):\n        # Create a rotation by slicing and concatenating\n        rotation = b[i:] + b[:i]\n        \n        # Check if this rotation is a substring of a\n        if rotation in a:\n            return True\n    \n    # If no rotation is a substring, return False\n    return False\n\n# Test cases\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"abcd\", \"abd\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"hello\", \"ell\"))  # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"whassup\", \"psus\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"abab\", \"baa\"))  # True\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"efef\", \"eeff\"))  # False\nprint(cycpattern_check(\"himenss\", \"simen\"))  # True\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **Loop through each possible rotation**: We loop from `0` to `len(b) - 1` to generate each rotation.\n- **Generate rotation**: For each index `i`, the rotation is formed by taking the substring from `i` to the end and concatenating it with the substring from the start to `i`.\n- **Check for substring**: We use the `in` keyword to check if the generated rotation is a substring of `a`.\n- **Return result**: If any rotation is found in `a`, return `True`.

Our task is to count the number of even and odd digits in this integer and return the counts as a tuple `(even_count, odd_count)`.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem\n\n1. **Handle Negative Numbers**: Since the sign of the number doesn't affect whether a digit is even or odd, we can work with the absolute value of the number. This simplifies the problem by removing the need to handle the negative sign.\n\n2. **Convert Number to String**: By converting the number to a string, we can easily iterate over each digit.

Initialize both to zero.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Digits**: Loop through each character in the string representation of the number:\n   - Convert the character back to an integer.\n   - Check if the digit is even or odd using the modulus operator `%`.\n   - Increment the respective counter based on whether the digit is even or odd.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all the digits, return a tuple containing the counts of even and odd digits.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- **Zero**: The number zero has one digit, which is even.\n- **Single Digit Numbers**: These should return either (1, 0) or (0, 1) depending on whether the digit is even or odd.\n- **Negative Numbers**: The negative sign should be ignored, as it doesn't affect the parity of the digits.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the function based on the above reasoning:\n\n```python\ndef even_odd_count(num):\n    \"\"\"Given an integer, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd digits respectively.\"\"\"\n    # Use the absolute value to ignore the sign\n    num = abs(num)\n    \n    # Convert the number to a string to iterate over each digit\n    num_str = str(num)\n    \n    # Initialize counters for even and odd digits\n    even_count = 0\n    odd_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over each digit in the string representation of the number\n    for char in num_str:\n        digit = int(char)  # Convert the character back to an integer\n        if digit % 2 == 0:\n            even_count += 1\n        else:\n            odd_count += 1\n    \n    # Return the counts as a tuple\n    return (even_count, odd_count)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(even_odd_count(-12))  # Output: (1, 1)\nprint(even_odd_count(123))  # Output: (1, 2)\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently counts the even and odd digits in the given integer and handles all edge cases appropriately.",

The task is to construct the expression using these lists and then evaluate it.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Input:**\n   - We have two lists: `operator` and `operand`.\n   - The `operator` list contains strings representing arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `//`, `**`.\n   - The `operand` list contains integers.\n   - The length of the `operator` list is always one less than the length of the `operand` list. This makes sense because between every two operands, there is one operator.\n\n2. **Constructing the Expression:**\n   - We need to construct an expression by interleaving the operands and operators.\n   - For example, if `operator = ['+', '*', '-']` and `operand = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expression should be `2 + 3 * 4 - 5`.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Expression:**\n   - Once the expression is constructed, we need to evaluate it.\n   - Python provides the `eval()` function, which can evaluate a string expression. However, using `eval()` can be risky if the input is not controlled, as it can execute arbitrary code.\n   - Since the problem guarantees that the input is controlled (only basic arithmetic operations and non-negative integers), using `eval()` is acceptable here.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps:**\n   - Initialize an empty string to build the expression.\n   - Iterate over the `operator` list and append each operand and operator to the expression string.\n   - After the loop, append the last operand to complete the expression.\n   - Use `eval()` to evaluate the constructed expression and return the result.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operator, operand):\n    # Initialize an empty expression string\n    expression = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over the operators and operands to build the expression\n    for i in range(len(operator)):\n        # Append the current operand and operator to the expression\n        expression += str(operand[i]) + operator[i]\n    \n    # Append the last operand\n    expression += str(operand[-1])\n    \n    # Evaluate the expression and return the result\n    return eval(expression)\n\n# Example usage:\noperator = ['+', '*', '-']\noperand = [2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = do_algebra(operator, operand)\nprint(result)  # Output should be 9\n```\n\nThis function constructs the expression by interleaving the operators and operands, evaluates it using `eval()`, and returns the result.

Since `hashlib` works with bytes, we need to encode the string to bytes using `encode()`.\n   - Finally, use the `hexdigest()` method of the hash object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash.\n\n5. **Implement the Function**: With the plan in mind, we can now implement the function.\n\nHere is the complete function definition:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef string_to_md5(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.\n    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input text is an empty string\n    if text == \"\":\n        return None\n    \n    # Create an MD5 hash object\n    md5_hash = hashlib.md5()\n    \n    # Update the hash object with the bytes of the input string\n    md5_hash.update(text.encode())\n    \n    # Return the hexadecimal representation of the hash\n    return md5_hash.hexdigest()\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(string_to_md5('Hello world'))  # Output: '3e25960a79dbc69b674cd4ec67a72c62'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Empty String Check**: The function first checks if the input `text` is an empty string. If it is, it returns `None` immediately.\n- **MD5 Hashing**: For non-empty strings, the function creates an MD5 hash object using `hashlib.md5()`. It then encodes the string to bytes and updates the hash object with these bytes.\n- **Hexadecimal Output**: Finally, the `hexdigest()` method is called on the hash object to get the 32-character hexadecimal string representation of the MD5 hash, which is returned as the result. \n\nThis approach ensures that the function handles both empty and non-empty strings correctly, providing the expected MD5 hash for valid inputs.",
