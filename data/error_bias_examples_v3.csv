1,Anchoring,Wrong initial calculation that persists,"First calculation feels ""right"" and subsequent steps don't challenge it",Recompute from scratch using a different method and verify each step,arithmetic
2,Confirmation,Accepts answer without verification,Stopping at first plausible result without double-checking,Always verify the final answer by substituting back or using inverse operations,arithmetic  
3,Availability,Uses familiar but wrong approach,Applying a common pattern that doesn't fit this specific problem,Identify the specific problem type and use the appropriate method,arithmetic
4,Hindsight,Rationalizes wrong answer post-hoc,Creating explanations after getting an incorrect result,Start over with the correct approach rather than justifying the wrong answer,arithmetic
5,Overgeneralization,Applies rule too broadly,Using a method that works in some cases but not this one,Check if the chosen method's conditions are satisfied for this problem,arithmetic
6,Anchoring,Fixated on first number seen,Using the first numerical value encountered as a baseline for everything,Ignore initial impressions and work through the problem systematically,word_problems
7,Confirmation,Stops at satisfying result,Choosing the first answer that seems reasonable without validation,Cross-check using alternative calculation methods,word_problems
8,Availability,Uses most recent similar problem,Copying approach from a different type of problem,Carefully read and identify the unique requirements of this problem,word_problems
