Final Answer: To solve the problem labeled ""Sample math problem 441,"" we first need to clarify what the specific problem is. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume it is a mathematical problem involving the number 441.
Let's explore a few mathematical aspects related to the number 441 and solve a problem involving it.
### Step 1: Factorization of 441
- 441 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Sum of digits of 441: \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\) (which is divisible by 3), so we check for divisibility by 3.

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**
To isolate \( 3x \), we need to eliminate the constant on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.
**Step 2: Solve for \( x \).**
