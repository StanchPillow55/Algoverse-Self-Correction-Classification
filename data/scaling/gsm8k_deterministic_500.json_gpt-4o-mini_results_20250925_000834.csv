Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of buying 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon, and then determine the cashback amount that will be received from the app company.
**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas before cashback.**
The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, we can calculate the total cost using the formula:
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Price per Gallon} \times \text{Number of Gallons}
\text{Total Cost} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars}

Final Answer: To determine the total cost for James to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the costs associated with purchasing the plane and the ongoing monthly expenses for the hanger and fuel.
### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane

Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to break down the distribution of straw among the different types of rodents and set up an equation based on the information provided.
- Since there are 3 cages of rats, the total number of rats is \( 3r \).
- Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats is \( 6 \times 3r = 18r \).
- Let \( h \) be the number of hamsters in each cage. The total number of hamsters is \( 10h \).
- The total straw given to the hamsters is \( 5 \times 10h = 50h \).

\text{Total pairs of shoes} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Pairs per child} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pairs}
2. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes**:
- To find the total cost, we multiply the total number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair:

Final Answer: To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) can be calculated using the formula:
Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:
1. Calculate the area of the base (length × width):
2. Now, multiply the area of the base by the depth to find the volume:

2. **Slices given to Bill**: Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the pizza to Bill. To find out how many slices this is, we calculate:
3. **Slices given to Mark**: Next, Jenny gives \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the pizza to Mark. We calculate this as follows:
4. **Total slices given away**: Now we add the slices given to Bill and Mark:

When holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than she can without it. Therefore, we calculate the distance as follows:
If Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet while holding the gemstone, we can determine the maximum distance she can stand from the dragon by subtracting the dragon's flame reach from the distance she can throw:
Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand **200 feet** outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house:**
Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we first need to calculate 30% of the value of Herb's house:
This means Juan's house is $22,800 less than Herb's house. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house:

- Total weight of sugar cubes = \( 2 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ pound/box} = 2 \text{ pounds} \)
- Total weight of carrots = \( 4 \text{ bags} \times 12 \text{ pounds/bag} = 48 \text{ pounds} \)

First, we need to find out how many segments of 3 miles are in 42 miles. We can do this by dividing the total distance by the distance covered in each segment:
\text{Number of segments} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance per segment}} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 14

So, Brady has a total of 100 + 200 + 200 = <<100+200+200=500>>500 cents.
Since a dollar is equal to 100 cents, then 500 cents is equal to 500/100 = <<500/100=5>>5 dollars.

Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 lb, we can calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs as follows:
\text{Total calories to lose} = 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
Next, we need to calculate the number of days from December 31 to July 19.

So the price of the car in the year 2010 is $20000 - $12600 = $<<20000-12600=7400>>7400.
#### 7400",0,0.3,None,0.5,0.4,"Key reasoning steps:
Final Answer: To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.
### Step 1: Identify the initial value and the depreciation rate
### Step 2: Determine the number of years of depreciation
### Step 3: Calculate the value of the car after each year
The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for depreciation:

When an additional 20 workers are hired in the third month, the total number of workers become 240 employees + 20 employees = <<240+20=260>>260 employees
In total, the company 260 employees * $4000/employee = $<<260*4000=1040000>>1040000 in wages on the third month.
The total amount of money the company pays to all its employees in the three months is $1040000 + $960000 + $880000 = <<1040000+960000+880000=2880000>>2880000

Final Answer: To determine Finley's final position in the race, we will track her movements step by step, starting from her initial position.
- Starting from 1st place, if she falls back 5 spots, we calculate her new position as follows:
Since there is no negative position in a race, we interpret this as moving to the last position. In a race with 100 meters, we can assume there are at least 6 participants (since she fell back 5 spots). Therefore, if she falls back 5 spots, she would be in 6th place.
- From 6th place, if she moves ahead 2 spots, we calculate her new position:

Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill:
Thomas loses 10 of these $20 bills. To find out how many bills he has left, we subtract the lost bills from the initial number:
Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. First, we calculate half of the remaining bills:

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( x \) represent the total number of students at the grade level. According to the problem, the number of students who do not have desktop computers is given as 20.

Final Answer: To find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total, we need to break the problem down into two parts: the fireworks from the city's display and the fireworks that Hannah sets off in her backyard.
### Step 1: Calculate the total number of fireworks from the city's display.
The city is setting off 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each. We can calculate the total number of fireworks from the city as follows:
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Fireworks per box}
\text{Total fireworks from the city} = 15 \times 20 = 300

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
- Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
- To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Final Answer: To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold over the course of 3 days. We will break down the earnings from sunflowers and bouquets, and then calculate the total number of sunflowers sold.
### Step 1: Calculate the number of sunflowers sold per day
- To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower:
\text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{\text{Earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
- To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet:
