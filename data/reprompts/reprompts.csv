S01,supportive,0,"Let's carefully revisit your reasoning. Identify any step that could be wrong and fix only that step, keeping correct steps unchanged."
S02,supportive,0,"Explain your approach briefly, then revise your final answer if and only if you find a concrete mistake."
S03,supportive,0,"Check units, arithmetic, and logical transitions. If something is off, correct the minimal step and update the answer."
S04,supportive,0,"Summarize the core idea in one sentence, then correct the solution in as few edits as necessary."
S05,supportive,0,"List assumptions you used. If any assumption is inconsistent with the problem, adjust it and revise the answer."
N01,neutral,0,"State the key decision points in your reasoning. Mark each as 'sound' or 'suspect'. If any are suspect, fix them and update the final answer."
N02,neutral,0,Perform a quick 'sanity check' on each intermediate step. Only change steps that fail the check; otherwise keep the answer.
N03,neutral,0,"Evaluate whether the answer directly addresses the question. If it doesn't, minimally revise the answer to address it."
N04,neutral,0,"Is the conclusion supported by every step? If a step lacks support or evidence, rewrite only that step and update the answer."
N05,neutral,0,"Compare your answer to the simplest possible solution path. If your path is unnecessarily complex, simplify it without changing correct content."
A01,adversarial,0,Point out the first specific error in your reasoning (not a generic critique). Fix only that error and produce the corrected answer.
A02,adversarial,0,"Assume one intermediate step is wrong. Identify which one and correct it, keeping all valid steps intact."
A03,adversarial,0,Find the earliest arithmetic or logical slip. Repair it precisely; avoid rewriting correct sections.
A04,adversarial,0,"If your final answer is already correct, state 'no change'. Otherwise, provide the minimal fix to reach the correct answer."
A05,adversarial,0,"Contrast your reasoning with a concise alternative method. If the alternative reveals an error, adjust and finalize the answer."
M01,meta,0,"Provide a one-line confidence estimate and justify it. If confidence is low due to a specific step, fix that step and update the answer."
M02,meta,0,Indicate whether any step relies on an unchecked fact. Verify that fact and revise only if the verification fails.
M03,meta,0,"Identify any place you may have 'anchored' on an early assumption. If anchoring occurred, un-anchor and revise minimally."
M04,meta,0,"Did you overcorrect by changing correct parts? If so, revert unnecessary changes and present the corrected final answer."
M05,meta,0,"If your revision adds complexity without fixing an error, revert to the simpler, correct version and finalize."
H01,holdout,1,"Re-derive the solution using a different path. If the result differs, reconcile the discrepancy and output the final answer."
H02,holdout,1,"Check for contradictions between steps. If any contradiction exists, resolve it with minimal edits and present the final answer."
H03,holdout,1,First predict whether your answer will change. Then perform a focused check and update only if a concrete mistake is found.
H04,holdout,1,"If any step depends on unstated assumptions, make them explicit. Validate each assumption; revise only if validation fails."
H05,holdout,1,"Locate the earliest point your reasoning could diverge. If divergence occurs, correct from that point forward and return the final answer."
