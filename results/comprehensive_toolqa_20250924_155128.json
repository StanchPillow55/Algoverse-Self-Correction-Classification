Get the location coordinates of the Paper Source store. This requires knowing the specific Paper Source location the user is asking about. \n2. Search for businesses within a 5 mile radius of those coordinates.\n3. Get the review count for each of those businesses. \n4. Calculate the average of those review counts.\n\nThe yelp_get_coordinates tool could be used to get the Paper Source location, but it requires the business name and postal code. The question does not specify which Paper Source location, so I don't have enough information to call that tool.\n\nThe yelp_search_businesses tool could potentially be used to find businesses in a radius around a location, but it does not have a radius parameter. It searches by location name rather than coordinates.\n\nThere is no tool to directly get review counts for a set of businesses. The yelp_get_business_info tool provides detailed information including review count for a single business, but I would need to know the names of the businesses to look up.\n\nIn summary, the key pieces of information I'm missing are:\n1. The specific Paper Source store location \n2. A way to find all businesses within a 5 mile radius of that location\n3. The names of those businesses to look up their review counts\n\nWithout those pieces, I don't believe I can answer the question using the available tools. I would need to ask the user for clarification on the Paper Source location to proceed.\n</thinking>",
