Calculate the total amount of milk the farmer can produce with his current 3 cows:\n   3 cows x 5 liters per day = 15 liters per day\n\n2. Subtract the current milk production from the desired milk production to find the additional amount needed:\n   25 liters per day - 15 liters per day = 10 liters per day\n\n3. Divide the additional amount needed by the milk production per cow to find the number of additional cows required:\n   10 liters per day / 5 liters per cow = 2 additional cows\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 2\n\nThe farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk per day.",

        "expected_answer": "2.0",
        "model_response": "I apologize, but I notice that the available tools are all Yelp-related business search and information tools. The question appears to be asking about what seems to be a residential property listing (given the mention of \"1BR w/ Balcony\" and \"Blueground\" which appears to be a housing/apartment rental company).\n\nNone of the tools available to me are designed to look up review rates for residential properties or Blueground listings. The available tools can only:\n- Search for restaurants\n- Get business information\n- Get ratings for businesses\n- Compare restaurants\n- Get business addresses, postal codes, coordinates\n- Get business hours\n- Check appointment requirements\n\nFINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine - the available tools do not provide access to residential property or Blueground listing review data.\n\nWould you like to search for information about restaurants or other businesses in Chelsea instead?

        "expected_answer": 2.0,
        "model_response": "Let me help solve this problem step by step using the available tools.\n\n1. First, let's calculate how much milk the farmer currently produces with 3 cows:\n- Each cow produces 5 liters per day\n- Current number of cows = 3\n\nLet me calculate the current daily production:\n\nLet me reason through this:\n\n1. Current production with 3 cows = 15 liters/day\n2. Target production = 25 liters/day\n3. Additional production needed = 25 - 15 = 10 liters/day\n4. Since each cow produces 5 liters/day, to get 10 more liters we need:\n   10 \u00f7 5 = 2 additional cows\n\nFINAL ANSWER: 2",
