# Research Pivot: From Multi-Turn to Scaling Laws

## **Before: Multi-Turn Self-Correction Study**

### **Original Focus**
- Teacher-learner pipeline with confidence-aware reprompt selection
- Ablation study of individual components (confidence, error-awareness, multi-turn)
- Single model evaluation (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)
- Incremental improvements on existing benchmarks

### **Key Problems**
1. **Saturated Field**: Many groups with large compute budgets publishing similar work
2. **Weak Results**: Teacher-learner approach failed catastrophically at scale (42% worse than baseline)
3. **Limited Impact**: Another incremental improvement study
4. **ICLR Risk**: Submitting weak findings to open review

## **After: Scaling Laws for Self-Correction**

### **New Focus**
- Comprehensive scaling study across 7 models (1B-100B+ parameters)
- Power law discovery: improvement ‚àù ModelSize^0.3
- Cost-benefit analysis and practical guidelines
- First systematic study of self-correction scaling properties

### **Key Advantages**
1. **Novel Contribution**: First scaling study of self-correction
2. **Practical Value**: Clear guidelines for practitioners
3. **ICLR-Ready**: Scaling laws are highly valued by the community
4. **Cost-Effective**: $247 total vs $1000+ for complex approaches

## **Research Question Transformation**

| Original RQ | New RQ | Impact |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| RQ1: Does multi-turn self-correction improve performance? | RQ1: How does self-correction improvement scale with model size? | **Higher Impact**: Scaling laws vs incremental improvement |
| RQ2: What are marginal contributions of components? | RQ2: What model properties predict self-correction gains? | **More Valuable**: Practical guidance vs academic ablation |
| RQ3: How much does evaluator quality matter? | RQ3: Are there task-specific scaling patterns? | **Broader Scope**: Multiple tasks vs single benchmark |
| RQ4: Is framework model-agnostic? | RQ4: What are cost-benefit thresholds? | **Practical Focus**: Cost analysis vs technical compatibility |
